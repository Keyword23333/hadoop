3450000 its very important that you understand what im asking im not talking about some silly little slap and tickle play spanking
3450001 okay what exactly are we talking about i want to understand
3450002 i want you to take me into the bedroom bare my bottom turn me over your knee and get a good tight grip on me then i want you to give me a real old fashioned no kidding spanking
3450003 i suppose youve considered the fact that a spanking like thats going to hurt
3450004 im sure it will at least if you do it right thats why its important that you understand what i want like i said ive been thinking about this since i was a kid heck ive probably needed it that long but youre the first person ive ever trusted enough to actually do it i have to know that your going to do it right that youll do it like you really mean it it cant be a joke tom im talking about a real old fashioned trip to the woodshed if you cant do that please tell me now i wont ask again i promise i know you probably think im crazy now as is
3450005 is it that youre feeling guilty about something i mean i know spankings are a turn on for a lot of people but this sounds like were talking about a real punishment im trying to understand but i need a little more to go on sweetheart
3450006 i know its confusing tom im not even sure i understand it myself and i know youre probably shocked but to answer your question well yes and no i mean yes there is a reason i think i really deserve one now but no its not just about punishment the thought of it really happening does excite me in some strange way
3450007 and you say youve felt that way since you were a kid
3450008 yep you see we never got spanked in my house my parents didnt believe in it some of my friends did though and whenever they would talk about it id get this funny tingling in the tummy feeling i didnt know about sex yet but i knew it excited me i dont know why i never have
3450009 when i got older old enough to have those kinds of feelings it finally started to make sense id see an old movie or t v show where a grown girl would get spanked by her husband or boyfriend and i knew exactly what it was doing to me id look at those scenes and think yes thats what i want
3450010 no but it wasnt for lack of trying i just couldnt seem to find anyone who would take the hint
3450011 and you really think you want me to do this
3450012 tom please understand youre the only person ive ever even trusted enough to tell little alone do it for me
3450013 and you say theres a reason you think you really deserve one now
3450014 yes you see i knew once things started to get serious between us that i would have to tell you about this spanking thing well i made up my mind that if i went as far as telling you i wouldnt do it half way i mean you know how i am
3450015 i made myself a promise that if i went through with this id take a real no kidding spanking and id take it right on my bare fanny if i was going to do that i wanted it to count for something i wanted to really deserve it so i just decided to let fate pick the time that is i decided if i was ever in a situation where i really felt like i had it coming thats when id tell you all of this
3450016 im still waiting to here what you did young lady
3450017 the other day when i was on my way to work well i was a running a little late and i guess i was a little distracted and well i got this
3450018 yes you did missy i hope you realize that this little lapse of attention put little childrens lives in danger
3450019 look at me when im talking to you young lady
3450020 kelly ann would i be wrong in guessing that you had your cell phone stuck in your ear when this remarkable lapse of attention occurred
3450021 is that everything you might as well get it all out now
3450022 tom i swear to you that ive been wearing it it was just that i was in a rush and i honestly forgot please believe me
3450023 i believe you honey but ive got to tell you if you set out to earn yourself a real fanny blistering you succeeded brilliantly
3450024 besides if youre still forgetting your seatbelt then you must need a real good reminder not to
3450025 kelly ann i think we need to continue this little discussion in the bedroom dont we
3450026 oh im going to do it all right missy i think youre going to remember my doing it for a good little while
3450027 i said you and i are going to the bedroom missy
3450028 i hope you do kelly ann flynn because in about a minute im going to put you right over my knee and administer what i promise you will be a very real spanking you asked for it and youve legitimately earned it and ill tell you something else young lady once this starts i am officially revoking your female prerogative to change your mind there will be no calling time out when it hurts and it is going to hurt missy this spanking will be over when and only when i think youve learned a meaningful lesson i want you to take a minute and really think about that if your not 100 committed to going through with this tell me now and well forget the whole thing and go back to the couch
3450029 i dont need a minute tom ive been thinking about this for more than twenty years we have to do this its like you said tom i asked for it and i really really deserve it
3450030 right now kelly ann dont make me come over there
3450031 i think i made it perfectly clear that this was going to be a bare fanny spanking young lady get those pants down
3450032 get comfortable youre going to be there for a while
3450033 kelly ann you know that i love you dont you i asked
3450034 i want you to understand that im not doing this because im mad at you i am very disappointed in you though what you did endangered your self and every one on the road with you didnt it
3450035 and youre certainly old enough to know better arent you
3450036 well my dear im of the opinion that if a twenty eight year old woman earns herself a spanking she had better be prepared to get an adult sized dose dont you think
3450037 im so sorry i disappointed you tom i know i deserve this
3450038 well then i think we might as well get right down to business give me your right hand
3450039 well we both know how your attention has a tendency to wander so lets make sure
3450040 if that phone rings when you are in the car you have two choices let your voice mail get it and call them back or pull over and answer it those are your only choices is that clear
3450041 no no please ill be good i wont talk on the phone in the car
3450042 like you were going to wear your seatbelt remember that promise
3450043 kelly ann what are you going to do if youre driving and your phone rings
3450044 ouch ouch not ouch not going ouch to ouch answer ouch
3450045 what was that young lady i couldnt hear you over all that spanking
3450046 all right kelly ann i think that will just about cover the speeding ticket now its time to talk about not wearing your seatbelt
3450047 oh god please i learned my lesson really i have
3450048 yes i know dear youve learned your lesson about the cell phone were on a different lesson now this one is about seat belts please try to keep up im sure youre not going to want me to have to go over any of this a second time are you
3450049 now as far as the seatbelt lesson goes there is good news and bad news which one do you want first
3450050 the good news is that im going to let you off with just ten swats
3450051 the bad news is that there going to be with my belt
3450052 then dont argue besides you have to admit its poetic
3450053 now as i was saying your getting ten licks for not wearing your seatbelt and i promise you young lady you are going to feel every one of them right down to your toes
3450054 oh god tom please not with the belt please just use your hand
3450055 what did i tell you about arguing with me young lady
3450056 too late missy you just earned yourself two extra that makes twelve licks now one more word of argument and it will be the full twenty
3450057 kelly ann im sorry i have to be so strict with you sweetheart but i really think you need this i think youve needed it for a good long time as much as these twelve licks are going to hurt i can guarantee you they wont hurt anywhere near as much as having an accident and flying through the windshield of your car i love you young lady if i have to tie you down and give you a hundred licks to keep that from happening to you i will do you understand what im telling you
3450058 all right then twelve good hard licks with the belt and this will be all over with are you ready
3450059 its meant to sting missy i want you to remember this licking every time your fanny hits your car seat that way youll remember to put your seat belt on wont you
3450060 i know but im going to let you off the hook i think youve learned your lesson havent you
3450061 yes sir i have but ive still got two licks coming
3450062 so do you feel like you got a real spanking young lady
3450063 i feel like i got ten real spankings and by the way i didnt say anything about a belt you big bully
3450064 you said you wanted a real woodshed quality spanking missy well ive read about those days they didnt march kids out to the woodshed for a little hand spanking that procedure involved a switch or a strap or something that would be truly memorable
3450065 just my luck id fall in love with a history expert
3450066 so is that how you want me to handle bad behavior from now on
3450067 are you okay with it i know its kinda weird ill understand if you dont want to do it again please be honest with me tom

3450153 we are very pleased to have bobby hutchens join our team at dale earnhardt inc
3450154 bobby will make a strong addition to dale earnhardt inc he brings two decades worth of experience and a tremendous amount of knowledge to our race teams this is another piece of the puzzle that we feel will definitely further strengthen our organization
3450155 im very excited about becoming a part of dale earnhardt inc
3450156 hopefully in the next few weeks and months we can begin to chart a path that will see dale earnhardt inc win a lot of races and compete for championships add comment
3450157 obviously it helped us points wise more importantly it picked everybodys spirits up we had kind of struggled the last couple of weeks so we needed a good run im proud of the team for building me such a good car
3450158 making the chase may be a long shot for us but im looking forward to the challenge even though you try to not focus on the points we know that we really cant afford to finish outside of the top five in the next four races and even then we probably need a win or two to get us in the top 12
3450159 weve had some great runs there the track is so smooth and wide its got a number of different racing grooves on it it is becoming one of my favorite tracks add comment
3450160 i understand why our company put ron in the car last week but it was still hard to not be in the race
3450161 rons a great road course racer and he proved that sunday his performance helped to move the team up to 30th in owner points and thats important
3450162 im glad to be getting back in the car at michigan
3450163 its a track where i feel really comfortable its fast wide and smooth you can run a number of different lines around the place so that makes it fun for the drivers
3450164 the team established some momentum last week and i plan on keeping things going in the right direction for us im looking forward to proving that i can go out there and get the job done
3450165 the past month or so ive been testing a lot and going out of town a lot and just last week i was in nashville for two days testing so ive been out of town a lot and were working on it right now pretty hard so well see what we can come up with here pretty soon

3450190 poor service delivery is the main cause for the xenophic attacks
3450191 the thing is were on the warped tour now and weve never played warped before and were not like a typical warped band but i guess a lot of kids asked us to be there
3450192 so were playing the mosh set on warped because we want to make sure the kids get to beat the sh out of each other because we know thats what they like to do
3450193 when you think warped you dont think of a band like us
3450194 we wear a lot of bright clothes we shake our butts a lot were very sarcastic were electronic usually warped is about the mosh but the truth is the scene is changing a lot these days and what unites all the bands on warped isnt a specific musical sound but its more of an ethic there are so many different types of bands on warped i cant tell you how surprised i am to have made friends with some of these bands that i thought were totally going to think were pu s like story of the year i just thought theyd hate us they listen to metal they have tattoos and were best buds on this tour the common thread of warped is the ethic
3450195 its definitely a great honor to be able to serve as a captain again this season and its a role and responsibility i take very seriously
3450196 but we want everybody to step up and be a captain of this team its important that we all accept a leadership role for this team if we hope to continue to build on the foundation that has been established these last few years
3450197 i know both casey and i take a lot of pride in the opportunity weve been given to serve as team captains this year
3450198 im honored that the girls on this team have enough faith in me to take on that kind of responsibility this season im just going to try to lead by example day in and day out in everything that i do to prove that im worthy of such a great honor
3450199 were really excited about both casey and roslyn taking on leadership roles and being named the captains of this team
3450200 in my opinion there is no higher honor than to be selected as a captain by your teammates both have proven to be great leaders on and off the field in their time at lsu and deserve the rank of captain in their senior seasons

3450237 the impact of russian actions goes beyond their threat to a democratic georgia
3450238 russia has used violence against georgia to send a signal to any country that chooses to associate with the west and aspire to our shared political and economic values
3450239 my friends we learned at great cost the price of allowing aggression against free nations to go unchecked
3450240 with our allies we must stand in united purpose to persuade the russian government to withdraw its troops from georgia
3450241 there must be an independent international peace keeping force in the separatist regions and we should ensure that humanitarian aid can be airlifted to georgias capital and stand ready to help our georgian partners put their country back together
3450242 and we must make clear to russias leaders that the benefit they enjoy from being part of the civilised world requires their respect for the values stability and peace of that world

3450371 ignores the massive biblical foundation of his teaching on spiritual formation
3450372 bases his entire spiritual disciplines book on his understanding of matthew 11 29 30
3450373 pauls teaching especially when added to his practices strongly suggest that he understood and practiced something vital about the christian life that we have lost and that we must do our best to recover
3450374 for further discussion of the matters discussed in this article see my the spirit of the disciplines
3450375 respect for willards calling to minister to students in secular universities
3450376 then for some reason the web site finds fault with willards belief that jesus calls the lost to be disciples thats kind of a big thing in the gospels
3450377 to make willard sound like he is opposed to the atonement
3450378 simply wants the western church to consider all of the different ways that the atonement is explained in the new testament not just the substitutionary model
3450379 the evil that we do in our present condition is a reflection of a weakness caused by spiritual starvation
3450380 if the missing element in the present human order is that of the spirit what then is spirit very simply spirit is unembodied personal power
3450381 today for the first time in our history as a nation we are being presented with a characteristic range of human behaviors such as fasting meditation simple living and submission to a spiritual overseer in an attractive light
3450382 like a child exploring the attic of an old house on a rainy day discovering a trunk full of treasure and then calling all his brothers and sisters to share the find richard j foster has found the spiritual disciplines that the modern world stored away and forgot and has excitedly called us to celebrate them for they are as he shows us the instruments of joy the way into mature christian spirituality and abundant life
3450383 they can only get us to the place where something can be done
3450384 p erhaps the best known quaker in the world today
3450385 because we bid people tremble at the word of god
3450386 likely that the name originally derisive was also used because many early friends like other religious enthusiasts themselves trembled i e quaked in their religious meetings and showed other physical manifestations of religious emotion
3450387 stresses a personal almost mystical knowledge of god and the workings of the lords inner light within all people
3450388 lord is there more you want to bring into my life i want to be conquered and ruled by you if there is anything blocking the flow of your power reveal it to me
3450389 was released to explore what were for me new and uncharted regions of the spirit following that event i began to move into several of the disciplines described in this book that i had never experienced before

3450407 credo che in europa sia stata sottovalutata la grandezza del conflitto si sarebbe potuto intervenire prima
3450408 due giorni fa ha proseguito la corrispondente italiana era stato dichiarato dalla georgia il cessate il fuoco sembrava che la russia volesse smettere di bombardare la georgia poi in realt ancora per quasi 48 ore sono continuati i bombardamenti e gli scontri nelle zone di conflitto ma anche fuori la garanzia per questa volta c e consiste nella presenza dei diplomatici occidentali e del presidente sarkozy come garante il clima sembra ora pi rilassato tbilisi non mai stata bombardata sono stati colpite nei giorni scorsi due installazioni una militare e unaltra dove si trovano delle paraboliche e un aeroporto militare questa mattina a tbilisi c stata unesplosione ma sembra che si tratti di una delle bombe sganciate dallaviazione russa ndr ancora non esplose da ieri mattina bomba che esplosa perch fatta brillare i combattimenti nella mattinata sono continuati a gori e questa notizia mi stata confermata da dei contatti che ho l sembrava fosse stata occupata dai russi poi questi ultimi hanno smentito questa informazione attualmente i russi non controllano i luoghi il loro obiettivo non era controllare gori ma respingere le truppe georgiane la citt stata abbandonata e gli abitanti si sono spostati tutti verso gli altri villaggi da parenti e amici queste persone vanno ad aumentare il numero dei profughi insieme a quelli provenienti dall ossezia del sud si contano 10 mila sfollati georgiani che dallossezia del sud si erano spostati verso gori e poi vista la situazione verso tbilisi si parla inoltre di 30 mila sfollati osseti verso lossezia del nord non si hanno ancora numeri esatti di questi profughi ma lassistenza umanitaria ha iniziato la sua attivit per i profughi in collaborazione con il ministero per i rifugiati le agenzie umanitarie e le organizzazioni non governative pertanto nei prossimi giorni si dovrebbe avere qualche notizia pi precisa anche sulle cifre non si hanno notizie nemmeno circa la condizione dei villaggi e delle case perch ad oggi nessuno potuto entrare n a gori n in ossezia del sud si dovranno valutare anche i danni causati da questa vicenda
3450409 e un paese che ha intrapreso un processo democratico e che vuole diventare un paese democratico sovrano e indipendente certo ci sono ancora dei problemi nella democrazia georgiana non una piena democrazia il presidente mikheil saakashvili ha mostrato autorit in pi di unoccasione
3450410 negli ultimi anni i rapporti politici con la russia sono peggiorati e questo evidente da quando il presidente saakashvili stato eletto a massima carica dello stato e soprattutto da quando ha annunciato come proprie priorit il ristabilimento dellunit territoriale della georgia e lingresso del paese nella nato questultimo fatto ha infastidito particolarmente la russia che non vuole avere come territorio confinante un paese nato dopo la questione del kosovo la russia ha per fatto dei passi avanti importanti nelle relazioni con le regioni di conflitto ad aprile ha stabilito i legami ufficiali con le due regioni di conflitto della georgia labkhazia e ossezia del sud stabilendo delle relazioni economiche culturali sociali ufficiali poi nel corso degli ultimi anni ha anche distribuito passaporti alla popolazione che viveva nelle terre di conflitto per quanto riguarda il futuro ci vorr ancora molto tempo perch si stabiliscano delle relazioni normali con la russia e difficile dire come si evolveranno ma l a normalizzazione delle relazioni processo lungo e lento e questa ultima azione stata davvero pesante sia per i cittadini georgiani che dai politici georgiani e poi sappiamo benissimo che un cessate il fuoco non una dichiarazione di pace

3450442 clearly overdone but the 35 fall in a month is equally unsustainable
3450443 unmistakable economic contraction of apocalyptic proportions would be necessary and this is not the case
3450444 the slowdown in demand related to the general economic downturn and high oil prices is becoming increasingly evident
3450445 consumers clearly are reacting by a change in driving behavior
3450446 the main driver will still be demand from the developing world where consumer are somewhat shielded from rising prices by government subsidies
3450447 i think its open to interpretation and thats the great thing
3450448 you know if i want to protest something because it offends me thats my right as an american and its also any artists right to say and do whatever they wanna do
3450449 when i heard about it i felt really hurt inside
3450450 i cannot believe a writer could write something like that its the not the way that we want to be portrayed we have feelings we dont like the word retard we are people
3450451 there were parts of the movie where i laughed but it seems to me that the movie tried really hard to go too far and then pull back on everything that was offensive except the issue of people with intellectual disabilities i just think ben stiller and the people involved in this movie just didnt think it was going to be offensive
3450452 no changes or cuts to the film will be made
3450453 if you want to pick on people as the old playground saying goes pick on people your own size
3450454 this population struggles too much with the basics to have to struggle against hollywood were sending a message that this hate speech is no longer acceptable
3450455 vp mit strache koaliert um sp von regierung fern zu halten
3450456 wir lassen uns diese unwahrheiten nicht mehr gefallen dass uns die vp bei den mieten abzocke unterstellt ist chuzpe die ohnehin niemand glaubt
3450457 wirklich rgert ist die l genkampagne gegen werner faymann die schon die ausma e der vp aggression gegen alfred gusenbauer annimmt
3450458 besch digt sich mit ihrem uns glichen geschimpfe selbst aber langsam reicht es auch uns

3450460 ich wei dass die vp alles versuchen wird um die sp von der regierung fern zu halten und zwar mit jedem denkbaren partner von van der bellen bis strache beide w rden sich auch keine sekunde zieren
3450461 politicians and scholars continue to debate the value of marriage for americans
3450462 with some going so far as to establish social programs and policies to encourage marriage among those socials groups less inclined to marry particularly the poor and minorities
3450463 encouraging marriage in order to promote health may be misguided
3450464 greater access to social support now than they did in the past
3450465 in advance of any centralisation of services we have to examine and ensure that the necessary capacity is available in the acute centres to take the additional services and to put it in place if it is not already there the hse said
3450466 we cannot cancel what we have decided because we lack financial resources
3450467 the issue must be settled through discussions by the ldp and new komeito
3450468 while the relative number of quarterly broadband adds has certainly peaked the decline in additions this quarter compared to the same period last year was exacerbated by verizon and at amp ts emphasis on selling higher speed fios and u verse bundled services often at the expense of the traditional dsl service
3450469 the nature of the internet is just a fundamentally different world from the sale of packaged software or the bundling of software with oems original equipment manufacturers
3450470 were pet people we love our dogs and were always looking for tips and products for caring for and pampering our fur families plus events and destinations that not only tolerate our best friends but welcome them
3450471 dog magazines arent published frequently enough traditional email newsletters always seem to be selling us something and there are simply too many websites and blogs to scour for the dog related information were seeking
3450472 woof report sniffs out the scoop delivers a daily dose of dog heaven
3450473 its the opinion of everyone on the board that the city needs to be cleaned up so lets clean it up
3450474 people are doing this dumping because they dont want to pay for the stickers
3450475 i consider this a tax increase to force the good apples to pay for the bad apples
3450476 so now we have this overwhelming pile of trash coming out of the dumpsters it is really becoming a health hazard
3450477 tenants are now hiding trash behind the units people have just turned to illegal dumping
3450478 trash is a service just like water sewer police and fire thats why were here tonight to say its not working
3450479 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace
3450480 the purpose of the operation has been achieved the security of our peacekeeping forces and the civilian population has been restored
3450481 i dont think russia will feel like talking with mr saakashvili after what he did to our citizens
3450482 were trying to get an assessment of exactly what it means what a halt means and whether its taken place
3450483 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people

3450485 if we could see a change in the burmese government people could move home in safety that would be the best result
3450486 the best solution would be if general than shwes regime would start real dialogue

3450489 ive been used to being a 40 1 outsider for the sack but there always comes a time when a manager is put in this position it seems this is my turn
3450490 it is something i dont need but nothing surprises me in football anymore though the bookies have made their predictions and we will have to see what happens
3450491 it doesnt concern me only if it comes true but i am confident i have got the backing of the club and the board
3450492 its the manager and his management team who are responsible for paying out the players salary
3450493 i would like us to be on the back pages for the right reasons
3450494 i tried ever so hard last year to stop people taking pot shots at us but it seems to have come back
3450495 it is always important to get off to a good start after the first eight games things settle down a little bit and you can see where you are
3450496 would not be in the best interest of the community
3450497 you know the water behind the river court is insanely dangerous if you jump in the tide will kill you
3450498 for years i resented my sister who my moved adored i wished i had been special to my mother now i see how messed up my sister is and im glad i was not the chosen one of a very sick mother
3450499 the aggressive person is one who tries to dominate others
3450500 what do you mean you arent going to do it

3450502 if i can put the blame on you i dont have to recognize and take responsibility for the negative qualities in myself what i cant stand about myself i really hate in you and have to attack you for it in order to deny that i have the same quality
3450503 scapegoating is a hostile social psychological discrediting routine by which people move blame and responsibility away from themselves and towards a target person or group
3450504 is this act wise i e will it injure myself or others will it contribute to my basic needs is it in alignment with the laws and forces of life what is the total price involved can i afford to pay it and am i willing to accept the consequences

3450523 today the georgian ambassador to the netherlands filed a law suit to the international court of justice called the state of georgia against the state of russia because of ethnic cleansing conducted in georgia by russia in 1993 to 2008
3450524 now honey i know you know how to spell this word try again
3450525 i just spent ten days of quality time in a compact rental car with this man i know what im requesting
3450526 war is a waste and sewage in water an even bigger waste
3450527 the idea is to show the russians that it is no longer business as usual said one senior official familiar with the consultations among world leaders that were going on primarily by phone and in person at nato headquarters in brussels where alliance diplomats met together and then with representatives of georgia
3450528 the slowdown in demand related to the general economic downturn and high oil prices is becoming increasingly evident
3450529 consumers clearly are reacting by a change in driving behavior
3450530 it looks too early to cite definitively a sea change in the market
3450531 flagged a vigorous start to what could be an active autumn storm season
3450532 obviously its a long ways away but the third round makes it closer im really excited for both of us to be playing really well for the u s
3450533 i think i play one of my best matches in the last weeks on hard court
3450534 ive never played singles at the olympics so this has been really cool for me
3450535 every time i walk out there its like im playing in my match but at the same time i have the whole u s team on my side its good i really like that feeling
3450536 and hopefully some of us will hear the national anthem at the end of the week
3450537 its hard to train for singles and always dealing with swelling ive just really been playing careful with it i really wanted to be here in whatever capacity it was and it became painfully obvious to me that role was doubles i was very happy to accept that and move forward
3450538 but with the time difference im still waking up like at 5 in the morning so its good i like the early matches
3450539 my way of improving on it is to keep it up
3450540 i played really clean matches in the past the next one would be kind of streaky i dont want to do that any more i just want to keep playing the same consistency
3450541 i felt like any time that i needed to serve well i did if i was down love 30 or a 30 all point
3450542 thats good for me going on in the later rounds that im tough on my serve

3450554 ive spoken to people who three or four years ago literally refused to relocate now theyre open to moving
3450555 they do not see growth or change in this market in the near future
3450556 in the past everything was done out of new york and that was the place to be

3450559 pools of capital will move to where the industry sees an expansion of opportunities
3450560 i dont know whether its as much theres not enough to do here so well go somewhere else

3450564 the lies of fox news and roger ailes have no place in public discourse journalism or the democratic party presidential debates
3450565 to not ratify fox news as a legitimate news source
3450566 weve got more violence and now we dont know who to talk to about it
3450567 we are deeply concerned because it leaves the radical extremist outfits free to do what they like not merely on the pakistan afghanistan border but clearly our side of the border too
3450568 its not like theres suddenly going to be a war between the two countries
3450569 in the absence of greater trust you will see a kind of pincer movement against pakistan by afghanistan and india and pakistans establishment and state turning toward whatever tools it has at its disposal to defend itself
3450570 we made more progress in terms of peace than we have in the past 60 years

3450607 i need 61 000 congolese francs about 120 60 for the surgery
3450608 i have all these people poor people and they are waiting for treatment some of them will die for lack of an operation that is the reality
3450609 what would be the point of doing that for five or 10 years if after that you could not look people in the eye
3450610 i am watching a lot of people dying and it hurts me these are innocent people and the government is there with its big villas and cars i cannot accept that
3450611 the president has made it clear that health is a priority
3450612 if we had people who were really patriotic it would be different
3450613 but until now we have just had people scrabbling for positions to make money
3450614 the shit he did thats what got me into heavy music vulgar display of power i was only into eighties music before that the heaviest thing i listened to was skinny puppy and ministry but that wasnt metal when i heard vulgar display i was like holy shit what the fuck is this the first time i ever saw them live before korn was even signed me and fieldy went and it was pantera and sepultura at irving meadows in l a they came out started the first song the curtain dropped and me and fieldy just started crying we looked at each other and we had tears in our eyes because it was so fucking intense and heavy and sick
3450615 when system of a down played with pantera at the forum my parents had come to the show and my parents are definitely not into heavy music at all

3450641 u s officials had been urging king abdullah to visit iraq to bolster ties between the two countries as part of washingtons campaign to shore up support for the iraqi government as a counterweight to iranian influence

3450644 were all volunteers including all the staff and myself as the candidate
3450645 that way they dont have to worry about spending a lot of money
3450646 also with the economy were concerned average citizens arent going to want to pay to a political campaign
3450647 they dont necessarily have the budgets to donate to politicians were aware of that were more focused on people just giving us their time rather than money
3450648 my apology to ralph nader for not demanding that he be included in the debates
3450649 that one out of every five dollars spent on the war in iraq has gone to contractors for the united states military and other government agencies in a war zone where employees of private contractors now outnumber american troops
3450650 no help for autistic children in baghdad alli abdul suffers from autism but cant get treatment in war torn region the problem for autistic children in iraq logan reports is that almost nothing is known about this condition
3450651 its time to open the debates to third party candidates
3450652 non violent drug offenses are being over prosecuted and corporate crime is being under prosecuted
3450653 the justice department must begin to reverse course crank up the crackdown on corporate crime and end the cruel and inhumane war on non violent drug possession
3450654 the criminal justice system is broken so badly that one hardly knows where to begin describing the breakdown
3450655 lets start with the war on drugs since commentators across the political spectrum recognize its lunacy we pour almost endless resources roughly 50 billion every year into catching trying and incarcerating people who primarily harm themselves this insane war on drugs damages communities and drains crucial resources from the police courts and prisons these resources could be better used to combat serious street and corporate crime that directly violates the publics liberty health safety trust and financial well being as with alcoholics and nicotine addicts the approach to drug addicts should be rehabilitation not incarceration
3450656 the current drug policy has consumed tens of billions of dollars and wrecked countless lives
3450657 the costs of this policy include the increasing breakdown of families and neighborhoods endangerment of children widespread violation of civil liberties escalating rates of incarceration political corruption and the imposition of united states policy abroad in practice the drug war disproportionately targets people of color and people who are poverty stricken coercive measures have not reduced drug use but they have clogged our criminal justice system with non violent offenders it is time to explore alternative approaches and to end this costly war
3450658 probably would not have gone on to have the career you have had
3450659 it is urgent that the u s reverse the incarceration binge the u s department of justice estimates that if incarceration rates remain unchanged an estimated one of every 20 americans and greater than one in four african americans can be expected to serve time in prison during their lifetime
3450660 it is time to make the failed war on drugs a central issue in the american political dialogue for too long we have let this injustice continue to grow unhindered taking action on clemency at the federal level will set an example for the states and begin the process of reversing this failed policy
3450661 the current cruel unjust policy perpetuated and enforced by the bush administration prevents americans who suffer from debilitating illnesses from experiencing the relief of medicinal cannabis
3450662 while substantial scientific and anecdotal evidence exists to validate marijuanas usefulness in treating disease a deluge of rhetoric from washington claims that marijuana has no medicinal value
3450663 in need of alternative crops and aware of the growing market for industrial hemp particularly for bio composite products such as automobile parts farmers in the united states are forced to watch from the sidelines while canadian french and chinese farmers grow the crop and american manufacturers import it from them
3450664 there now is a significant and growing backlog of criminal investigations and unresolved matters
3450665 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3450666 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3450667 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3450668 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3450669 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3450670 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3450671 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3450672 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3450673 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3450674 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3450675 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

3450677 as we enter the second half of 2008 we continue to experience strong sales growth across all markets and we have achieved consistently high and significant year on year gains in china and general markets in particular these results represent great performance by our sales team especially given the difficult industry environment

3450679 but he still has that drive to be here and to do his best it is an amazing thing to watch
3450680 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3450681 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3450682 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3450683 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3450684 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3450685 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3450686 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3450687 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields

3450691 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3450692 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3450693 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3450694 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3450695 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3450696 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3450697 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3450698 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3450699 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3450700 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3450701 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3450702 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3450703 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3450704 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3450705 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3450706 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3450707 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3450708 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3450709 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3450710 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3450711 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3450712 who are open to doing something on the production side
3450713 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3450714 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3450715 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3450716 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3450717 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3450718 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3450719 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3450720 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3450721 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3450722 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3450723 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3450724 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3450725 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3450726 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3450727 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3450728 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3450729 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3450730 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3450731 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3450732 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3450733 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3450734 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3450735 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3450736 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3450737 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3450738 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3450739 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3450740 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3450741 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3450742 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3450743 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3450744 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3450745 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3450746 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3450747 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3450748 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3450749 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3450750 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3450751 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3450752 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3450753 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3450754 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3450755 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3450756 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3450757 some time before we see some growth in the economy
3450758 the second quarter is the sixth consecutive quarter of home value declines and we see little promise of turnaround in the short term as the rates of decline have yet to slow and in fact actually accelerated in many markets

3450860 while this investigation is taking so long people are losing the trust that they had in the county government and it is a very big heavy cloud not only on the correctional officers but on the county
3450861 the longer it takes people will begin to suspect that the county government is trying to do a cover up and that is not what we want to happen
3450862 naacp has a very grave concern about the lack of progress in the investigation of the homicide of ronnie white
3450863 it has been more than six weeks since the medical examiner had the body and has not completed the full and final report we feel that ivey can request and should request that the medical examiners report be expedited
3450864 raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3450865 its nice to have familiarity but sometimes its better to not have the same surroundings to grow as a person
3450866 im sure weve all run into these people whether theyre friends boyfriends or girlfriends
3450867 where there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime we vigorously prosecute
3450868 but not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
3450869 that does not mean as some people have suggested that those officials who were found by the joint reports to have committed misconduct have suffered no consequences
3450870 far from it the officials most directly implicated in the misconduct left the department to the accompaniment of substantial negative publicity
3450871 their misconduct has now been laid bare by the justice department for all to see
3450872 as a general matter in such cases where disciplinary referrals are appropriate they are made to put it in concrete terms i doubt that anyone in this room would want to trade places with any of those people
3450873 honey its not that i dont like meeting new people i just dont like making small talk
3450874 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3450875 sorry im not talking much but im trying to save my voice for the studio
3450876 as soon as i touched it i got a boner
3450877 first we got gilez to do his drum parts so we could get a speed for the song after we had that down we points to vikki played along to it to create a guide track which has all the bits and pieces in it so we can hear each others playing when we record our actual takes
3450878 then i played the bass part right here on the sofa
3450879 i didnt need to use my amps because i could plug my bass straight into the console via my sansamp
3450880 i put down the rhythm guitar track fairly easily over that
3450881 its double tracked copied so that it comes over the left and right channels to give it more strength i think it took four or five takes which we comped together and then i added some extra guitar sprinkles to liven it up
3450882 i wish there was a way to put the sprinkles in the live set but chronologically theres no space to play them
3450883 were working a lot better in the studio this time around and were used to working with tipler you have a lot more freedom when you record a cover version as well because youre not trying to explain a new concept you already have the structure and the context of the song so its really more a question of interpreting it
3450884 and because its a b side there isnt the same pressure as there was for the album this is really a bit of fun for us
3450885 when it came to making the album there were other songs that stood out more it was always in my mind to save this for a b side and it compliments the a side so well it seemed like the natural choice
3450886 usually you pretty much know when its finished you want to make it as good as it can possibly be without crushing all the spirit out of it
3450887 even now there are things on the album that id like to change parts of it were entirely comped everything from the drums through to the vocals but once wed committed ourselves to recording those songs we put the cost to the back of our minds and made the best record we possibly could
3450888 when i used to produce the cds on my pc at home there was one song i think it was either vindicated or trust i spent over a hundred hours just on that song if i had a studio like tiplers youd never see me again id just be locked in there the whole time
3450889 expect to see us playing a lot more gigs from about mid october

3450920 would not be in the best interest of the community
3450921 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier
3450922 this is not surprising as the infineon 3g chipset solution has never really been tested in the hands of users some people will not experience these problems as it is only in areas where the radio signal weakens that the immaturity of the stack really shows
3450923 this shows the risk of not going with a tried and tested solution
3450924 the nature of the internet is just a fundamentally different world from the sale of packaged software or the bundling of software with oems original equipment manufacturers
3450925 he postulates that this is partially due to moores law which states that the number of transistors on a chip could double every 24 months which has translated into a boom in it and consequently an increase in global productivity
3450926 the number of servers in the u s has grown from 5 million in 2000 to 10 million in 2005 to a projected 15 million in 2010 more servers eat up more electricity and energy costs go up to avoid future energy shortages caused by increasing it demands 10 more power plants need to be built to the tune of 2 billion to 6 billion each and their cost is ultimately going to get passed on to it through increased utility bills
3450927 spending 2 500 on a server really means spending between 8 300 and 15 400 in facility capital to provide the necessary space for housing the server and powering it
3450928 facility asset utilization is low at 55 because of the length of time required to justify fund plan and build a major data center typically 24 months or longer and the large incremental cost and risk of subsequently increasing its capacity data centers are typically over built at least in the early years as a result average facility utilization is low relative to capacity
3450929 depending on tier level depreciation ranges from 42 to 50 of total facility costs facility depreciation per server is not typically calculated because depreciation is a single lump into a big cost bucket and this doesnt motivate companies to conserve
3450930 just the electricity required to provide power and cooling will exceed the cost of the server in six years
3450931 facility operations include mechanical and electrical technicians physical security staff facility equipment maintenance and repairs property taxes and other physical facility expenses within a wide range these costs are largely fixed and on a unit basis would come down significantly if spread across a larger base that would result from increased facility utilization
3450932 greenhouse gas emissions per server based on a coal fired electricity source are 4 tons per year
3450933 for an organization with 5 000 servers the industry rule of thumb is that up to 30 are technologically obsolete
3450934 the movie they think theyre making isnt a movie anymore
3450935 we like to say that there are 11 million pairs of eyes to ensure good government in ohio
3450936 everything i have done in the house is absolutely above board and always has been
3450937 it is unbelievable that this should have happened and even more unbelievable that the council should have spent several hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxpayers money on this illegal vendetta

3450941 its hard to do youve got to play consistently well it takes one to two hours a day to get to the level where you could win these competitions

3450944 its onwards and upwards from here i want to play in some scottish competitions and see how i stack up against some of the worlds best pipers it will be very educational
3450945 this thing was introduced to be a blanket approach that would encourage people to come in to town earlier and go home earlier this way people just go to another bar
3450946 we thought this process was nailed down but it appears it is not
3450947 due to legislative boundaries police did not believe they had any authority to release the report wider without the specific direction of the authority
3450948 are there any plans to replant in the area the traffic island that whole area of frankton rd is shabby theres no planning

3450951 the company advises that the proposed capital raising by way of convertible note and options must be considered to be uncertain at this time
3450952 the fundamental issue is that government is not funding us appropriately and the community has already contributed so much
3450953 there is only so much a community can be expected to fund raise for what is essentially a core health service
3450954 that will not be helped by the constant threat of having their income taken away
3450955 its like he has got to the top of the ladder and pulled it up under him denying other people the chance to improve their position
3450956 helen clarks claims about a return to work for the dole is utter garbage national has specifically rejected that approach in this policy
3450957 if labour really cared about the plight of beneficiaries why after nine years hasnt it adjusted the amount a beneficiary can earn before they start losing their benefit
3450958 this change is all we wanted thank god someone has finally listened to the little people this is wonderful
3450959 this may save someone elses life if it does the fight wasnt in vain

3451004 this is exactly what happened in the democratic primaries this year
3451005 we have obama and clinton going at it for months after the republican primary has been decided john mccain couldnt buy media attention at that time because everybody is focused on the attributes that obama and clinton were arguing about

3451007 is energy policy more important than foreign policy the fact that youve got two candidates talking ad nauseam about energy policy makes them turn their heads and say that must be important

3451009 if a woman had 10 years that she stayed at home with her family a traditional assessment would have been that she did nothing in those years

3451041 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3451042 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3451043 had it not been my teacher i would not have become a priest
3451044 it is also to establish the fact that government and the private sector can work closely together in the development of the industry to favourably compete on the international scene

3451047 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3451048 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3451128 even those who dont die as a result of it theyre still often left with significant disability and loss of independence
3451129 furthermore use has been increasing in recent years likely because of a number of factors including increasing affordability with the emergence of generic and over the counter formulations

3451148 it is clear that these projects that are being debated for executive decree do not have anything to do with increased security for the citizens but with the creation of militarized entities for the national defense with military men who visualize the society as guerrilla being
3451149 we have failed to modernize or update either the police system nor the intelligence system and now we are reaping the negative fruits from a lack of an updated system
3451150 es claro que estos proyectos que se debaten por decreto nada tienen que ver con la seguridad ciudadana sino con la creaci n de entes militarizados para la defensa nacional con militares que visualizar an la sociedad como un ente guerrerista
3451151 nosotros no hemos modernizado ni actualizado el sistema policivo ni de inteligencia y ahora estamos cosechando los frutos negativos de la falta de actualizaci n de este sistema

3451158 dude thats in play get the heck off the wall
3451159 id go id probably go like milan or something like that where i grew up or something like that peace out do you know any reasonable person that would turn down 50 million dollars because i grew up in italy it has more significance to me because im more familiar with it ive been there and i still have friends there im thinking about buying a house out there it would be nothing to me to be able to do that
3451160 if someone wants to throw 50 million on the table for me we can talk
3451161 they throw 30 40 50 million a year at me i cant turn that down i think right now its very exciting theyre starting a new buzz you start to do a little research and they got money over there you stay in the states you make the max you make 18 million take out taxes and you have 9 10 you have an opportunity to go somewhere and make 25 30 tax free we might have to pack our bags
3451162 it would definitely be something id consider you can never say never to anything the olympics have shown how this game has grown its not just the united states game anymore its the worlds game
3451163 as a businessman i would have to consider it if my wife was down and the money was right
3451164 from a business standpoint you have to at least listen to every offer
3451165 youre right only cska dynamo and khimki are the teams with huge money in europe along with olympiakos and panathinaikos from greece so if we are talking about lebron or kobe or any other superstar it all comes down to these five teams bc triumph formerly dynamo moscow region surprised everybody by signing krstic to a three million euro per year deal but its their only big buy so far and nobody knows what will happen next i think it is possible that one of these teams will find the money for an nba superstar yet 50 million is still outlandish were not talking about going roughly from 25 million team payroll to 32 million as was the case with childress but going from 25 million to 75 million it would make a little more sense if we were talking about what would be a 50 million a year nba contract which would equal about 17 million euros per year im sure that teams are preparing for talks and nobody is actually ready to just throw out 50 million now anyway its hard to predict anything because this will be an unprecedented move that will change the way we think now about sports contracts cska used to be the team paying crazy salaries compared to other teams in europe but for the last several seasons they have been coached by ettore messina and instead of chasing big names they try to get players that will fit the system this season when everyone is signing superstars the biggest names cska got are zoran planinic and erazem lorbek they are not the team that puts all their eggs in one basket messina is only signed until next summer though so well see what happens also cska has the most success in terms of public relations is well known everywhere in the world and they may be ready to spend to make the next step in these terms if youre nike youd want your player to be in moscow which is one of the world capitals playing for a well known team khimki have been big spenders for several years and this summer they went over the top the reason for that is they are hoping to get a contract with euroleague next summer when it could become a closed league it was announced that euroleague will look at marketability of the teams so khimki signed not just quality players but well known players from nba teams and successful national teams in carlos delfino and jorge garbajosa they went for the biggest names they thought they could target each player received what would be a 9 million a year nba contract the euroleague contract talks will continue next summer and if khimki are desperate to sign the deal they will have to spend crazy money actually if i were the euroleague i would quietly put pressure on the team and say you get lebron and well sign you to a euroleague contract on the other hand this is a smaller city in moscow region dynamo has a reputation of an underarchieving team here in russia they spend cska like money on their roster yet the results are very different this year they finally got a great coach in david blatt and also signed bostjan nachbar to what would be again a 9 million nba contract they are rumored to be targeting ben gordon now that its known that players of this caliber are available for the right money once again its impossible to tell how far the team can go in terms of spending because whats happening now is unprecedented for years dynamo has been the richest team that is not in the euroleague and they are desperate to get in the league still it is not surprising that it was a greek team which was the first to hand out a huge contract their owners have the most freedom to act because they are just that owners one person for each team russian teams have to find sponsors for each deal either from businesses or local governments which takes time and pursuasion sic if a greek owner feels like spending it will take him a second to give a go ahead to team management eccentric billionaire fan owners is not what russia is about
3451166 even more enticing to james has to be the revelation that earl boykins recently signed contract with italys virtus bologna includes income from bolognas sponsorship and marketing arms due to the nbas collective bargaining agreement this sort of arrangement is off limits in the nba but its exactly what lebron james inc is looking for james is right he wont become a billionaire by playing basketball so he and his management team have begun to look for more than endorsement dollars theyre now interested in equity stakes in the companies lebron lends his name to what if the owners of cska moscow or olympiacos the two teams reported to have contacted james offered him equity stakes in the teams and or outside business ventures they accumulated their billions in in addition to his playing salary an equity stake in a billion dollar business would pay dividends long after james called it quits on the hardwood and it would inch james closer to his stated goal of becoming the richest man in the world if the nbas collective bargaining agreement allowed it you can bet that james would negotiate an ownership percentage in the cavs or the soon to be brooklyn nets or the new york knicks any discussions between james and olympiacos or cska moscow will begin with what the euroleague can offer that the nba cannot
3451167 i wonder if the nba will be forced to adopt an mls style
3451168 european teams have rules that limit the number of non european teams that can be on their roster
3451169 but seriously cleveland cant pay 50 million for lebron nor should any american team pay that
3451170 cleveland shouldnt pay nor should any american team yadda yadda
3451171 you look at kids they take their shoes off and run around all the time maybe his feet were hurting that day well educate him a little bit more and tell him about keeping his shoes on till he gets inside we dont like things to happen but they happen what can you do other than try to educate them
3451172 it would take a serious unexpected setback for him to be unavailable for the cowboys game
3451173 there have been many challenges but the greatest one is probably trying to get to know the strengths and weaknesses of the organization both on and off the ice this takes time and being around the people on a daily basis i believe any strong organization starts with good people in the right places and now that i have spent a full year here i feel that i have a better handle on our strengths and weaknesses

3451177 today marks the 10th anniversary of the al qaeda terrorist attacks on u
3451178 all day today theyve been bombing georgia from numerous warplanes and specifically targeting the civilian population and we have scores of wounded and dead among the civilian population all around the country
3451179 my country is in self defense against russian aggression russian troops invaded georgia
3451180 our goal is to see a crowd of 75 000 people at obamas nomination speech holding their hands above their heads fingers laced together in support of a new direction for this country a renewed hope and acceptance of responsibility for our future
3451181 we thought lets try and start a movement where even while walking down the street people would hold up the o and you would know that they were for obama
3451182 its a great honor that my teammates chose to vote for me the opening ceremony is the best day and the best moment of olympic life

3451185 there is no reason for outrage the man was a rapist
3451186 if we had the death penalty here there wouldnt be so many crimes
3451187 were concerned for the precedent that the execution may create for the rights of mexican nationals who may be detained in that country
3451188 frankly im convinced that the national interest demands a new approach to our interaction with the world like many im astonished at barack obamas meteoric rise as a candidate i have no doubt his is the leadership we need
3451189 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of nonideological bipartisan decision making
3451190 barack obamas platform is a call for change but the change that he is so gracefully articulating is more renewal than departure it is rooted in very old american values that are as much a part of the republican as the democratic tradition theres an emphasis on individual rights fairness and balance at home and progressive internationalism
3451191 that the thoughts prayers and support of the are with that great little nation as it struggles today
3451192 i told him that i know i speak for every american when i said to him today we are all georgians
3451193 the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world
3451194 no big deal i will just get adjusted and heal up

3451196 in the half we hit the target we set the business in 2005 of adding more than 60 000 rooms on a net basis by the end of 2008
3451197 this is a big milestone and we have passed it six months early growth looks set to continue as we have been signing two hotels a day into our development pipeline which now stands at almost 1 800 hotels

3451203 heavy weapons and artillery have been sent there and tanks have been added
3451204 deaths and injuries have been reported including among russian peacekeepers its all very sad and alarming and of course there will be a response
3451205 russian georgian relations have deteriorated to the point that some kremlin officials are seriously weighing a military operation which they hope will hand georgia a military defeat and topple president saakashivili
3451206 its springtime a time to start a war with georgia
3451207 saakashvili is out of control and needs to be brought to heel
3451208 if georgians keep quiet and behave we may even tolerate their joining nato but if they are loud well take measures
3451209 jika paket memiliki informasi awal header seperti ini maka inilah yang harus dilakukan terhadap paket
3451210 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
3451211 we are fulfilling our agreement with the georgian government that in an emergency we would assist them in redeploying their troops
3451212 we are honoring that commitment and we are following through with that

3451222 i believe that the probability of finding life on mars is 6 203 10 23 to four significant digits
3451223 my brain has attached the subjective arbitrariness label to its representation of the number in your belief
3451224 but what do you mean by justification havent you failed to make any progress and just passed the black box
3451225 your mind labels x as a justification for y whenever adding x to the pool of cognitive content would result in y being added to the pool or increasing the intensity associated with y
3451226 but by this time i hope you can predict my answer to that sort of question whether or not you agree
3451227 in all likelihood the effectiveness of the protests surrounding the 2008 olympics in china will be short term and fade away in the memory the chinese government and international olympic committee ioc will heavily censor bottom up protest which is less likely to be covered by the mainstream media in any event unless it comes in the form of a terrorist attack and state led protests which does interest the media more inevitably wither in the face of the growing commercial and political importance of china
3451228 the two competing superpowers used the olympics as a battleground for propaganda viewing each medal won whistle blown and smatter of spectator applause as a symbol of their superiority
3451229 the games did not as we know lead to washingtons lifting of its embargo or travel ban
3451230 baseball diplomacy led to the defection in 2002 of cubas star pitcher jose contreras who had held the orioles to two runs in nine innings but instead of joining the os he signed with the new york yankees for millions of dollars even in the 21st century dollar diplomacy still functions
3451231 the only sensible response to the mounting numbers of emergencies is to match emergency donations dollar for dollar or better with investments in the long term capacity of agriculture to provide us with the food feed and fiber we need these longer term investments must go to publicly held food reserves investment in sustainable technologies vast improvements in water management investment in roads storage communications and other infrastructure
3451232 are still focused on investment and growth in agriculture based on privatization schemes deregulation and trade facilitation this is exactly the approach that has contributed to many of the problems we are seeing today in the food system its likely that this approach will worsen rather than ease the crisis
3451233 like the good count of transylvania the world trade organizations doha round of negotiations has died more than once
3451234 it first collapsed during the wto ministerial meeting held in cancun in september 2003 after apparently coming back from the dead many observers thought it passed away a second time during the so called group of four meeting in potsdam in june 2007 only to come back yet again from the dead now the question is whether the unraveling of the most recent mini ministerial gathering in geneva was the silver stake that pierced the trade rounds heart rendering doha dead forever
3451235 one of the spps core projects is the creation of an integrated regional energy market in order to guarantee the supply of oil to the market that uses it most the united states the spp has proven to be a great help to oil companies for the grab of mexicos reserves
3451236 so little happened at the july 19 meeting it could hardly be called a diplomatic encounter
3451237 in fact iran has been pursuing a productive diplomatic course rather than responding to deadlines and ultimatums iran has steadily put forward proposals for resolving its differences with the european and american governments over its nuclear energy program
3451238 baseball big and little its role in u s cuba relations
3451239 i told him that i know i speak for every american when i said to him today we are all georgians

3451243 the odds are the retired folks theyre getting pensions theyre getting social security they have investment assets they own a house so theyre better off than somebody who is 30 or 40 years younger whos trying to buy a house and trying to start saving
3451244 like many im astounded at barack obamas meteoric rise as a candidate but i have no doubt that his is the leadership we need and that the world is crying out for

3451251 alle werden sagen ich muss ihn besiegen ich muss ihn schlagen das sehe ich nicht so
3451252 ive been used to being a 40 1 outsider for the sack but there always comes a time when a manager is put in this position it seems this is my turn
3451253 it is something i dont need but nothing surprises me in football anymore though the bookies have made their predictions and we will have to see what happens
3451254 it doesnt concern me only if it comes true but i am confident i have got the backing of the club and the board
3451255 its the manager and his management team who are responsible for paying out the players salary
3451256 i would like us to be on the back pages for the right reasons
3451257 i tried ever so hard last year to stop people taking pot shots at us but it seems to have come back
3451258 it is always important to get off to a good start after the first eight games things settle down a little bit and you can see where you are
3451259 a spaceman from those ufos and he was from woking what would it be like for ardiles and villa coming from the other side of the atlantic the great and the good of the english game queued up to proclaim that it would never work
3451260 so the new season is upon us at last or already depending on your point of view i for one am delighted last time out manchester united won their first and last games on penalties winning the community shield in
3451261 its now 30 years since fresh from winning the world cup osvaldo ardiles and ricardo villa left argentina and touched down at white hart lane tottenhams coup was years ahead of its time just a few months later paul weller

3451268 i got a championship ring from that and to me that is very rewarding
3451269 i told the guys that it was just as important for me winning it as a manager as it was for me when i won it as a player
3451270 you can see a kid doing something wrong on the field and you teach him the right way
3451271 then over time hes doing it the right way and all of a sudden hes on the right path now you teach him something else and something else its important because i guarantee you every big league ballplayer playing right now had somebody teach him something
3451272 they just didnt wake up one day and were that good they may have had the ability but they also had to be taught somewhere along the line to use what they have
3451273 i look back at it now and i think how the hell is that possible the best team in the world i just look back in amazement
3451274 theres such great competition to be the best in the world and have to have that title for the rest of your life thats just unbelievable
3451275 you dont expect to have those kinds of accolades especially as a 12 year old
3451276 most people dont realize that you have the rest of your life ahead of you its tough to follow something like that

3451280 but you dont know until you keep going you are winning youre winning and you are like oh man i guess we are pretty good
3451281 we just kept winning we didnt really think about it we were 12 years old
3451282 looking back you realize its pretty impossible to do that
3451283 as a 12 year old you cant really grasp the magnitude you are just playing a game it really doesnt change the stakes you cant really understand the stakes its just the same game over and over

3451338 students cant learn and teachers cant teach in classrooms where kids are disruptive some teachers are afraid to restore order when needed because they fear legal harassment its unacceptable that a teacher would have that hesitation

3451352 it is now a time in my career where i should not see myself or allow other people to see me as a young player any more
3451353 a lot of the players when i first walked into the dressing room are no longer around and i have 43 test caps so it is time to step up and deliver
3451354 it looks like i might get an opportunity now at number three and it is up to me to take that opportunity
3451355 you look at the best players in the world and a lot of them bat at number three or number four
3451356 people might say that batting at number five is easier than three but you want to test yourself as much as you can and batting at number three you do that
3451357 you could be in after the first ball or three hours later that challenges your skills as a batsman and that is what i want to face up to
3451358 i know i can do it i have done it a little bit in the ashes but i have to start converting those 50s into hundreds like i did at lords against south africa
3451359 if i can do it more consistently i will know i am going in the right direction and hopefully the best years of my batting are still ahead of me being 26 now i have got experience behind me and i know a bit more about test cricket
3451360 anyone that looks into the dressing room and sees the talent inside it would believe it is possible we can win the ashes there is a lot of ability
3451361 like kp said if we play like we did at the oval and at times this summer we can do it the important thing in the lead up to 2005 was that we were winning test matches regularly it became a habit and we played consistent cricket
3451362 a lot of bands and artists feel that its hard to get any interest from record labels due to the state most labels are in they all seem to be playing it very safe

3451459 christian art is a rational form of art we think of gothic art great music or the baroque art right here but this is the artistic expression of a much broader form of reason in which the heart and reason come together this is the point this i think is in some way the proof of the truth of christianity the heart and reason come together beauty and truth touch and to the extent that we are able to live in the beauty of truth so much more will faith again be able to be creative in our own time as well and to express itself in a convincing artistic form

3451476 this publication includes materials from the international conference which was held in tbilisi on 7th march in 2007 the conference was titled g i gurdjieff from south caucasus to western world his influence on spirituality thought and culture in italy europe and in the usa the conference was the initiative of embassy of italy in georgia and hosted by tbilisi state university of javakhishvili and shota rustaveli theatre and film university
3451477 equally important was the possibility for scholars to breathe the very georgian atmosphere that inspired gurdjieff when he established in tbilisi in 1919 the first institute for the harmonious development of man
3451478 isnt gurdjieff after all a believer in things unseen in a disenchanted scientific era a dogmatic teacher claiming authority quite difficult to sell to a postmodern world where any claim to authority is tantamount to authoritarianism
3451479 we learned again in tbilisi that gurdjieff is always complicated and elusive
3451480 had a remarkable influence on culture and spirituality in the west
3451481 i think that this initiative may help the intelligentsia of tbilisi and georgia after decades of prohibition during the soviet period to recall the heritage of a man who was a son of the south caucasus
3451482 the exact details of his birth or his year of birth
3451483 the sources of its originality and innovation remain largely unknown even at the beginning of the 21st century
3451484 our findings demonstrate that among listings accessed on the internet gurdjeiff is staunchly positioned in second place immediately after rudolf steiner
3451485 at the heart of gurdjieffs teaching is the idea that mankind is born with great potential for development but in the state of ordinary consciousness does not have the capacity to understand nor to fulfill this potential
3451486 he may have been a secret advisor to the tsar a russian agent or a buddhist monk and advisor to the dalai lama
3451487 this paper reports on the activities and findings of the gyumri gurdjieff study group
3451488 precise details of gurdjieffs date of birth and the district street and exact house where gurdjieff and his family lived in gyumri
3451489 our group discovered that gurdjieffs understanding as a mystic philosopher starts from influences upon him from the armenian medieval capital ani others today confirm that the origins of western spiritual science have roots in the land of shirak
3451490 about the origins of gurdjieff and his activities in georgia
3451491 all we can say with certainty is that his fathers name was ivan
3451492 as for gurdjieff he is not fixed in the lists thus he was not a class fellow of stalin but we cannot say for sure that they did not know each other
3451493 gurdjieff travelled a lot for years he had lived in tibet and the central asia where he was seeking for esoteric knowledge
3451494 direct transmission of energy from one person to another under specified conditions
3451495 the fundamental focus of gurdjieffs teaching is inquiry rooted in practice in which everything in life is brought into question
3451496 and other organizations founded by individuals who left gurdjieff or his pupils to establish independent groups
3451497 no titular head of the foundation network has emerged since his death approximately 2 500 3 300 members worldwide are involved in the foundation network
3451498 under the aegis of the ouspensky foundation located in amsterdam the netherlands
3451499 the elements of his teaching will continue to be appropriated and modified with little discernment contrary to the principles of an esoteric teaching
3451500 from mary poppins to franco battiato gurdjieff influence on the italian culture and spirituality
3451501 travers work still maintains the taste of a genuine gurdjieffian experience and is a good introduction to the fourth way for beginners
3451502 a possible influence of eastern christianity in the thought of gurdjieff
3451503 we have a collection of various components of religions put together without an order of possible priorities more quoted than organized in a coherent system
3451504 moreover what is most original in him is not his theoretical system but his initiation to self knowledge through the experience of everyday life
3451505 mystical speculation in my view was psychologically a very comfortable response counterbalancing the existing situation
3451506 wisdom is not a teaching it is form of existence the form and style which does not need to be justified but followed
3451507 if a man is tied to something the universe will also be tied to the same one cannot learn freedom from prometheus tied to a rock
3451508 most importantly his work draws on egyptian mysteries the pythagorean school tibetan rituals sufism oriental traditions and many others
3451509 tbilisi attracted many intellectuals mystics and followers of different esoteric schools
3451510 a system of reflexes based on a georgian national folk dance
3451511 gives examples of the caucasian oriental asian mentality specifically with respect to friends and teachers
3451512 the concept of parabolas is a very important part of the teaching
3451513 this is another way to discover the universe for oneself and to study in order to get answers through sacred parabolas
3451514 the book meetings with remarkable men was filmed by peter brook in 1979 in consultation with madame jeanne de salzmann the film adaptation is quite far from the book itself the film is more of a tribute to mr gurdjieff and his personality than an analysis of his writing
3451515 his remarkable work beelzebubs tales to his grandson is an original creation that tries to show the history of civilization through the eyes of a witness to all history beelzebub
3451516 it is difficult to find a clear definition for the style of this book
3451517 from ancient atlantis to the contemporary united states of america
3451518 theatre of anthropology which is a new way of theatre study carried out through discovery of ancient rituals
3451519 gurdjieff figures prominently in the work of all of these artists yet more research needs to be done to discover more about this connection to the major cultural trends of this century

3451536 i encountered one such woman recently she came to me quite upset because windows xp on her computer had become corrupted somehow and a technician re installed it for her but she was missing several years worth of pictures of her child when he was a baby shed never run a single backup in four years and despite my efforts using undelete software i was only able to recover a fraction of the photos shed lost it was heartbreaking to have to tell her that several years worth of photos were lost forever

3451541 in accordance with the django 1 0 release roadmap tonight weve released the first alpha testing version of django 1 0 this release includes all of the major features due for inclusion in the final django 1 0 though some lower priority items are still scheduled to be included before the 1 0 feature freeze which will occur with the first beta release next month
3451542 heres a check list of things you can do to make sure your application can be optimized quickly when you put on your optimization hat note most applications dont need all of this since most applications do not get anywhere near enough traffic to justify even bothering but if youre lucky enough to need to optimize your django app i hope this post can help you
3451543 assume that you have built a small tool that you would like to share only with family and friends how could you prevent other unauthorized people to just gain access to your app one solution to the problem is store a list of permitted users in a list either hardcoded or in a database this will work if you know exactly who the selected few are but is also means that you have to administer the list and keep it up to date a more generic system would be an invitation based access like gmail originally had but that would mean one would also need to manage those invitations somehow in the database the following example shows a middle ground a simple technology called hmac to make sure a particular google account is actually supposed to have access
3451544 python is clever enough to use the karatsuba algorithm for multiplication of large integers which gives an o n1 6 asymptotic time complexity for n digit multiplication this is a huge improvement over the o n2 schoolbook algorithm when multiplying anything larger than a few hundred digits unfortunately division in python is not so well equipped python uses a brute force o n2 algorithm for quotients of any size several algorithms in mpmath perform several multiplications followed by a single large division at high precision the final division can take as much time as all the preceding multiplications together division is needed much less often than multiplication but it is needed nonetheless newtons method to the rescue

3451561 in georgia overall everything that has to do with domestic demand has huge potential
3451562 however as the stock market is not that developed for bigger investors it is either bank of georgia and a couple of other stocks or private equity investments
3451563 the stock is cheap but not at a distressed level yet
3451564 should the conflict continue in georgia bank of georgia might find it difficult to refinance its loans at reasonable rates
3451565 foreign investors have been net sellers of emerging europe equities since 2006 but have been net buyers of bonds due to the increased carry trade
3451566 as risk perception has increased that might also bring along outflows from eastern european fixed income instruments
3451567 that will be a good thing for emerging europe as it relieves current account deficits and increases competitiveness of export driven companies and industrials that have suffered from strengthened currencies
3451568 going to war with russia is bad for your creditworthiness to put it mildly
3451569 i dont think what has happened substantially changes the fundamentals for other countries but it may be a wake up call to some people who hadnt properly appreciated potential russian impact in the region
3451570 youd expect this to affect sentiment towards them as it is more evidence of russia trying to exert control over its nearest neighbors
3451571 a more aggressive russian foreign policy within the former soviet union is likely to pose a threat to ukrainian asset prices in due course
3451572 obviously people will also be looking at the former soviet republics with borders with russia
3451573 the big difference is that you do not have any particular disputed border regions except for a very small area of estonia or areas with a large russian population
3451574 a worsening in relations between russia and the west would put at risk russian supplies of gas to european countries
3451575 situations like this lead to a general sense of instability and so i think investors will have to weigh up chances of continuing problems in the region going forward
3451576 you wonder how much transportation risk has been mitigated or reduced by building infrastructure through more volatile regions but its too early to make that assessment just yet
3451577 the conflict should give second thoughts about seeing any region as the safe haven or the magic bullet type solution to energy security
3451578 if you look at the long war in chechnya that russia had again it had no measurable impact on the domestic growth scenario
3451579 and that was a long and a bad and a protracted war i dont really see this having any impact investors will look at it digest it and if they see that event has no impact on their investments they wont divest
3451580 one likely result is that the events will harden the resolve of those governments and companies who seek to bypass russia in extracting caspian resources
3451581 the russian military actions in georgia will likely have a profound affect on relations between russia and all the former soviet states particularly ukraine which like georgia aspires to join nato
3451582 the door is shut now the players cant go full stop

3451611 personally i think its a top four decision and im prepared to say that quite often the tough decisions go the way of the teams in the top four and you dont get the rub of the green and it was wrong and they also should have had a player sent off as well when we had a fast break

3451681 well what i was thinking was this was something that was personal to my own family my family knew everything about it everything and on top of that if you look back bob i mean ive seen people like for example john mccain talk about the mistakes that hes made in his past with respect to his first marriage and left it i think basically at that i mean im not the first person to do this but i dont want to i dont want to talk about that

3451683 we have upwards of 100 military trainers who are in georgia now weve been able to account for all of them they are not involved in the hostilities
3451684 last weeks ceremony in the central asian republic of azerbaijan to open the baku tbilisi ceyhan oil pipeline received scant coverage in the international press nevertheless the completion of the us backed pipeline which has taken a decade to construct will inevitably accelerate the scramble for oil and gas in the caspian basin region and heighten the potential for conflict among rival major powers from the outset planning for the oil pipeline was guided not by immediate economic considerations but long term us strategic goals since the early 1990s washington has been determined to exploit the unprecedented opportunity opened up by the collapse of the soviet union to establish its hegemony in the key resource rich region of central asia the 1 770 km pipeline simply known by the acronym btc is one of the worlds longest and cost 4 billion to build it snakes its way from the sangachal oil and gas terminal south of the azeri capital of baku on the caspian sea through neighboring georgia and some of the most mountainous regions of the caucasus to finally reach the turkish port of ceylon on the mediterranean as far as washington was concerned the chief consideration in plotting this tortuous path was to undercut the existing pipeline system in russia and to avoid iran which offers the shortest and cheapest pipeline route from landlocked central asia to a coastline the us has maintained an economic blockade of iran since 1979

3451695 georgia has no significant oil or gas reserves of its own but it is a key transit point for oil from the caspian and central asia destined for europe and the us crucially it is the only practical route from this increasingly important producer region that avoids both russia and iran the 1 770km 1 100 miles baku tbilisi ceyhan pipeline which entered service only last year pumps up to 1 million barrels of oil per day from baku in azerbaijan to yumurtalik turkey where it is loaded on to supertankers for delivery to europe and the us around 249km of the route passes through georgia with parts running only 55km from south ossetia

3451699 the games of the 11th olympiad were the most siginificant olympics of the modern era and thomas wolfe who was himself there captures the atmosphere
3451700 something like a wind across a field of grass was shaken through that crowd one sensed a stupendous concentration of effort
3451701 and the thing that made it seem ominous was that it so evidently went beyond what the games themselves demanded
3451702 to collect royalties which had been blocked from leaving the country during this trip it became obvious to wolfe what hitler and nazism were doing to germany a country he loved

3451707 the u s electrical grid the system that carries electricity from producers to consumers is in dire straits
3451708 electricity generation and consumption have steadily risen placing an increased burden on a transmission system that was not designed to carry such a large load
3451709 in the years ahead we in the united states will have more and more problems with our electric grid this is likely to result in electrical outages of greater and greater durations
3451710 quite a few people believe that if there is a decline in oil production we can make up much of the difference by increasing our use of electricity more nuclear wind solar voltaic geothermal or even coal
3451711 if frequent electrical outages become common these problems are likely to spill over into the oil and natural gas sectors one reason this may happen is because electricity is used to move oil and natural gas through the pipelines in addition gas stations use electricity when pumping gasoline and homeowners often have natural gas water heaters and furnaces with electric ignition these too are likely to be disrupted by electrical power outages
3451712 the u s power transmission system is in urgent need of modernization
3451713 growth in electricity demand and investment in new power plants has not been matched by investment in new transmission facilities
3451714 despite efforts to mitigate blackout risk the data available from the north american electric reliability council nerc for 1984 2006 indicate that the frequency of large blackouts in the united states is not decreasing
3451715 the august 2003 blackout was a wake up call for the country to upgrade its transmission grid system
3451716 but the truth is that very few major transmission projects have been constructed and as a result transmission capacity has failed to keep pace with the expansion of power demand
3451717 in some cases demand has reached levels that were not expected for another three or four years
3451718 very hot weather tends to cause more incidents of equipment failure in the distribution systems although the bulk power system provided adequate supply extreme heat and surging demand put the distribution systems through extreme stress leading to some equipment failures and localized power outages
3451719 we are concerned about new england because there is nothing in the pipeline but some small renewable projects and wind
3451720 the need to strengthen the existing transmission infrastructure to expand it and to effectively harness advances in technology constitutes the single most pressing challenge for the countrys electricity system

3451725 the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america in essence the americans have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals
3451726 georgia could have used the years of saakashvilis presidency in different ways to build up the economy to develop the infrastructure to solve social issues both in south ossetia abkhazia and the whole state instead the georgian leadership with president saakashvili undertook consistent steps to increase its military budget from us 30 million to 1 billion georgia was preparing for a military action
3451727 in addition to the spy drones israel has also been supplying georgia with infantry weapons and electronics for artillery systems and has helped upgrade soviet designed su 25 ground attack jets assembled in georgia according to koba liklikadze an independent military expert in tbilisi former israeli generals also serve as advisers to the georgian military
3451728 the conflict has been sparked by the race for control over the pipelines carrying oil and gas out of the caspian region the russians may just bear with the pro us georgian president mikhail saakashvilis ambition to bring his country into nato but they draw a heavy line against his plans and those of western oil companies including israeli firms to route the oil routes from azerbaijan and the gas lines from turkmenistan which transit georgia through turkey instead of hooking them up to russian pipelines jerusalem owns a strong interest in caspian oil and gas pipelines reach the turkish terminal port of ceyhan rather than the russian network intense negotiations are afoot between israel turkey georgia turkmenistan and azarbaijan for pipelines to reach turkey and thence to israels oil terminal at ashkelon and on to its red sea port of eilat from there supertankers can carry the gas and oil to the far east through the indian ocean
3451729 as far as natural resources are concerned russias hand is very strong it holds 6 6 percent of the worlds proven oil reserves and 26 percent of the worlds gas reserves in addition it currently accounts for 12 percent of world oil and 21 of recent world gas production in may 2007 russia was the worlds largest oil and gas producer as for national champions putin has strengthened and prepared gazprom the state controlled gas company transneft oil pipeline monopoly and rosneft the state owned oil giant that is why in 2006 gazprom retained full ownership in the giant shtokman gas field 7 and took a controlling stake in the sakhalin 2 natural gas project in june 2007 it took back bps kovytka gas field and now is behind totals kharyaga oil and gas field

3451736 were killed by their own georgian partners in the peacekeeping forces there is a russian battalion an ossetian battalion and a georgian battalion and all of a sudden the georgians georgian peacekeepers begin shooting their russian colleagues this is of course a war crime i do not rule out that the hague and strasbourg courts and institutions in other cities will be involved in investigating these crimes and this inhuman drama that has been played out
3451737 the actions of georgia have led to deaths among them are russian peacekeepers the situation reached the point that georgian peacekeepers have been shooting at russian peacekeepers now women children and old people are dying in south ossetia most of them are citizens of the russian federation as the president of the russian federation i am obligated to protect lives and the dignity of russian citizens wherever they are those responsible for the deaths of our citizens will be punished

3451743 the government hasnt been able to make out a case against simi and therefore false grounds are being prepared
3451744 till date not a single allegation against simi has been proved while the planned attacks of the sangh parivar against christians dalits and muslims have been exposed by various inquiry commissions

3451774 not at all that was our impartial and probably unanimous judgment we saw attorneys hold back tears and weep alongside their clients we saw judges prosecutors clerks and marshals do their duty sometimes with a heavy heart but always with a particular solemnity not accorded to the common criminals theyre used to encountering
3451775 your honor i am concerned from my attorney client interviews that many of these people are clearly not guilty yet they have no choice but to plead out
3451776 you know i dont agree with any of this or with the way it is being done in fact i ruled in a previous case that to charge somebody with identity theft the person had to at least know of the real owner of the social security number
3451777 as a citizen i want our judges to administer justice not a federal agency when the executive branch forces the hand of the judiciary the result is abuse of power and arbitrariness unworthy of a democracy founded upon the constitutional principle of checks and balances

3451947 were not willing to sacrifice our economy for what is potentially a very small amount of oil or gas in comparison to the world supply and will do very little if anything to lower prices

3451965 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier
3451966 this is not surprising as the infineon 3g chipset solution has never really been tested in the hands of users some people will not experience these problems as it is only in areas where the radio signal weakens that the immaturity of the stack really shows

3451970 mondays claim from howard wolfson clintons communications director during the campaign that two thirds of edwards supporters would have supported clinton is just not supported in data collected directly from those who actually participated in the caucuses
3451971 had edwards not been running and if nothing else had changed my data suggest that obama would have ended up even further ahead of clinton than he was
3451972 as the campaign progressed few edwards supporters i knew gave any indication that clinton was their second choice
3451973 in my own caucus which i chaired when our edwards group was initially declared non viable there was discussion of moving but to obama not clinton in the end we gained viability by bringing over richardson and biden forces and by negotiating with the obama group
3451974 an iowa campaign without edwards would have had a totally different dynamic with a different focus on issues with different media coverage for all of the candidates and probably with some breathing room for bill richardson or joe biden
3451975 if youve never been in iowa during a caucus campaign you cant begin to understand how the dynamic works how candidate focused it really is take out one candidate and its an entirely different animal

3451979 two issues are involved here one is political discussion the other is administrative the matter involves coordination we are reviewing all the aspects to deal with it smoothly so it is taking time

3451990 we have procured 7 24 337 tonnes of rice and paddy till now it was only 6 50 000 tonnes of rice and paddy in the same period last year

3451992 the report may take some time to reach the customs house
3451993 tragically the bangladeshi police have copied rabs actions killing several hundred people over the past few years since a state of emergency was declared on january 11 2007 the rab and the police have often operated together
3451994 the rule of law cant become a reality in bangladesh unless the very forces tasked with upholding the law are also bound by it

3451996 its perfectly normal that russia would want to defend the interests both of russians in russia and russophones outside russia
3451997 it is also normal for the international community to want to guarantee the integrity sovereignty and independence of georgia
3451998 as a friend of bangladesh my sense is that here is an area where could probably be dialogue between the caretaker government and the political parties as to how to move down the road that will lead to free and fair elections in december
3451999 how could one expect to establish the rule of law in a country where the high court verdict is not implemented

3452006 for years there has been concern about these individuals on haart so these findings are somewhat reassuring ie that these men do not have rampant atherosclerosis there is no evidence at all from this study that being hiv positive or the duration of haart therapy has anything to do with cac
3452007 my impression is that physicians perhaps because of the worry about the potential for atherosclerosis with haart are being fairly aggressive with lipid lowering therapy in this cohort at least and they are clearly overtreated in this regard however statins in low doses are relatively safe so maybe its good and maybe its better than no treatment
3452008 these results could be due in part to lower lipid values of hiv infected men prior to beginning antiretroviral therapy and high use of lipid lowering drugs the key is that controlling risk factors for atherosclerosis should be a priority
3452009 my own feeling is that the atherosclerosis story is going to turn out to be a traditional atherosclerosis story about their blood pressure their lipids and their smoking and these guys have a high rate of smoking and not due to their hiv infection or even to the haart
3452010 that these people have the same risk factors as everybody else and probably should be treated in exactly the same way
3452011 where we showed that if you stopped the haart you suddenly got a huge increase in mortality within a short time so there may be a secondary effect on thrombosis coagulation and inflammation that we are looking at now
3452012 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3452013 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3452014 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3452015 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3452016 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

3452020 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3452021 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3452022 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3452023 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3452024 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3452025 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3452026 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3452027 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3452028 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3452029 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3452030 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3452031 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3452032 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3452033 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3452034 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3452035 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3452036 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3452037 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3452038 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3452039 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3452040 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

3452059 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3452060 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3452061 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3452062 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3452063 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3452064 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3452065 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3452066 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3452067 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3452068 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3452069 where can an author get accurate information about the many book clubs and book discussion groups that exist in the u s
3452070 my book is titled the blind prophet one of six books in my invisible war series and its a story about angels and demons it should be published the first of the year
3452071 somebody suggested offering a free review book to the person from these groups who selects the novels but i cant find a list anywhere can your publicity hounds help me
3452072 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3452073 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3452074 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3452075 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3452076 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3452077 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3452078 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3452079 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3452080 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3452081 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3452082 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3452083 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3452084 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3452085 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3452086 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3452087 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3452088 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources

3452096 you seem to have mastered the calm demeanor aspect of this game
3452097 i guess just seems to me that you dont get excited by your wins and dont get disappointed by your losses if youre playing right it should all work out at the end of the year
3452098 we see enormous growth potential in the future and have solid strategies in place to support our goals
3452099 the impact of department stores tightening inventory levels gives us just as much opportunity
3452100 it helps maintain a wider pricing gap between us and the department stores and can increase average ticket
3452101 thats what i would expect from benz always any way
3452102 i think our bigger fear was that we didnt want to offend any religious people but looking at the discussion that unfolded from this thing what we had was a good sizeable group of players that we might call militant atheists and the rest of the players seemed very tolerant including all of the religious players
3452103 we didnt want to go too far down that path we leave the whole creation of the universe question open
3452104 obviously as the player youre coming in and playing something like a god directing the evolution of a species but we never really state who you the player are

3452113 it feels awesome i was actually glad to have made the final for the first time after missing out at sydney and athens so to win the gold is amazing
3452114 it felt like the only people that believed in us was us
3452115 everyone got off to a slow start including the pitchers batting and fielding
3452116 it was kind of out of nowhere because they called me about a month before and said they werent going to take me they were going to take some older guys
3452117 i was in birmingham and i thought the team had already left but then scott got called up to the big leagues and i guess i was next on their list
3452118 so it was kind of a mixed feeling i didnt know if i was going to go
3452119 i wanted to stick around but its tough to pass up a chance to go to the olympics
3452120 ive been dreaming about this since i was playing for the junior team in 02 when we went to sherbrooke so i just couldnt pass up the opportunity it was a once in a lifetime deal
3452121 especially with baseball being out of the olympics in 2012 with this being the last shot deal i decided id better go
3452122 that should be fun theyre kind of the whose who of minor league baseball and a lot of their guys have been in the majors at some time or another
3452123 but if we play our game we should at the very least hang with them we expect to medal here we arent in awe of these guys theyre a good team and were going to have to play well but we know we can beat them
3452124 ive faced a lot of guys who were in contention for that team and who are on that team so its not like i dont know who these guys are
3452125 if i pitch like im capable of i should be able to do well
3452126 this is a big stage especially pitching against the u s so if i do well it would bode well for me
3452127 i talked to all the reds guys before i left and they were happy with the progress ive made early on in the year we had a pretty bad team so it was tough to pitch and that played a bit into how things were going
3452128 but i plan to play winter ball and if i can keep pitching like i have lately i have a pretty good chance of starting up in aaa next year
3452129 thats the plan and im really looking forward to having a chance to do it
3452130 ich finde diesen sport faszinierend weil er kraft mit sthetik vereint
3452131 ich kann das alles noch gar nicht realisieren f r diesen tag habe ich mein leben lang gearbeitet
3452132 ole geh rt seit jahren zum gro en kreis der weltspitze er hatte seinen tag er ist ein gro er taktiker und hat unseren plan in allen k mpfen voll umgesetzt
3452133 dass ich sogar das erste gold f r deutschland geholt hab ist ein hammer
3452134 ich bin noch nie in so einem gro en wettkampf gefahren das stadion war voll die ganzen zuschauerrufe haben mich gepuscht
3452135 aber ich habe trotzdem nur noch die strecke gesehen ich konnte mich konzentrieren ich konnte mich voll entfalten die ganze atmosph re hat gepasst ich konnte richtig mit freude fahren so ein gef hl habe ich noch nie im wettkampf gehabt
3452136 da wusste ich sofort dass das ne medaille war ich h tte nicht gedacht dass ich heute soweit nach vorn fahre
3452137 es kommt darauf an dass man nicht gegen das wasser arbeitet sondern sich den richtigen weg durch die wellen sucht immer sch n auf der welle bleibt und nicht von jeder gestoppt wird

3452140 im jahr brauche ich zwei bis drei boote entweder weil ich sie kaputt fahre oder weil vielleicht die form nicht optimal war
3452141 ich habe letztes jahr parallel ein fernstudium begonnen weil man kein direktstudium machen darf solange man bei bundeswehr angestellt ist
3452142 when you walk in the stadium is gigantic its almost breathtaking to see how big it is its just jam packed with people too and its just surreal
3452143 its a very humbling experience walking in there and realizing this is the biggest stage in the world and millions of people are watching what youre doing
3452144 the last thing we want to do is put any pressure on these guys
3452145 theres absolutely no pressure on us were not supposed to be able to play with these teams well go out there and play relaxed
3452146 all were asking from them is to give two and half hours of the best time you can give us
3452147 whatever happens happens weve not worried about winning or losing
3452148 lets just play and play hard lets play team saskatchewan baseball
3452149 pitchers cant change or find more velocity than theyve already got but its a matter of being a little more accurate on location and keeping the hitters off balance with off speed pitches
3452150 i definitely think it works to our advantage at the plate because swinging a bat some of the hits that would be ground outs in wood bat tend to find their way through

3452210 i dont blame people for questioning eg picking me up in place of evolution
3452211 unfortunately my father decided to turn my internet off after that event so after four months of having no internet i came back and didnt know what was going on in the community
3452212 i was still pretty good and i joined a team called ebol full of players that i used to help when i was on mindscape since they were all local
3452213 i was asked to ring at a local lan and eg at the time emg was attending so i was down to go the team i went with was an iplay pug and we happened to win the lan and beat emg in a best of three series
3452214 i was asked to ring for iplay again but this time to go to an x3o qualifier 3 that eg was attending we made it to day 2 and ended up playing eg on dust2 and going in overtime and almost beating them
3452215 i dont blame people for questioning eg picking me up in place of evolution i as nepo havent accomplished anything internationally yet especially compared to scott i think its perfectly normal for them to react the way they have
3452216 i feel no pressure really since our team has complete trust in one another and thats all that matters
3452217 i feel no pressure really since our team has complete trust in one another and thats all that matters i havent had to make any adjustments at all after joining eg since the way i was bought up in this game is to think and play fast
3452218 as long as we are performing the way we should be and getting the ws everything should be fine usually only some players on a team get the credit in the eyes of the audience and its usually the top fragger s but that wont have any effect on me or the people around me we all trust one another and understand what were doing to win the rounds

3452262 it would seem that men and women need a common motivation namely a common adversary to organize and act together in the vacuum such as motivation seemed to have ceased to exist or have yet to be found the need for enemies seems to be a common historical factor bring the divided nation together to face an outside enemy either a real one or else one invented for the purpose democracy will be made to seem responsible for the lagging economy the scarcity and uncertainties the very concept of democracy could then be brought into question and allow for the seizure of power in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill the real enemy of the elites and their minions then is humanity itself

3452266 today 18 07 06 i went again to the camp and good grief i cant really describe that horrific trip my car was the only moving vehicle everywhere was in deep silence and destruction its only 4 km from my house to the camp the first half of the way was manageable but as we approached the camp it seemed to me from the first impression as if haunted by ghosts no one can enter the area as it is extremely dangerous with the bombed airport on one side and the now totally destroyed shia suburbs on the other it was a scene of total devastation with all the buildings and roads totally smashed i was shocked and overwhelmed there was the smell of death and destruction everywhere the moment i entered the camp i felt i was on an island so isolated from the surrounding i joined the other ngos and arranged for an emergency meeting with them for a long term plan to aid the camp we didnt know where to start from the needs were so massive and beyond our expectations its true that we have had a long experience during the past war but the situation now is different for now we have no hierarchal structure in the camp or maybe has almost disappeared in the past the plo was in charge and provided people with all the assistance but now the question is who could carry this burden along with us ngos even the ngos are very tight with funds all the shelters in the camp are not viable for protection at all they have not been used since 1987 not even enough medical resources the women children and elderly are terrified and trapped after days of sustained brutal bombing of the entire area around our camp there is no electricity no fuel for the generators no medical supplies and we are in urgent need of food and drugs for the children and the elderly

3452298 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier
3452299 this is not surprising as the infineon 3g chipset solution has never really been tested in the hands of users some people will not experience these problems as it is only in areas where the radio signal weakens that the immaturity of the stack really shows
3452300 this shows the risk of not going with a tried and tested solution
3452301 i actually think that given the number of comments made from industry executives at e3 or thereabouts about how they didnt put enough resources against development of wii games that the industry has realized that the old adage of only first party games sell on nintendo systems is absolutely incorrect i think youre right that the data will cause a few eyebrows to lift
3452302 total third party sales for the xbox 360 since launch is currently 67 929 999 units followed by the wii at 33 394 311 units and the playstation 3 at 19 976 325 units
3452303 third party sales for the xbox 360 since the launch of the wii and ps3 is 54 065 728 units still almost double the wiis 33 394 311 units
3452304 no matter how you slice it the wii third party game story is not a pretty one
3452305 sold 60 million total software units where 56 percent are third party units or 33 million keep in mind that this does not include wii sports since its in pack with the hardware it is not counted as a software sale
3452306 35 million software units 84 percent of which were third party or 29 million total

3452315 iphones success raised the bar of consumer expectations regarding mobile multimedia
3452316 handset manufacturers worldwide are in the midst of revamping their product lines against this new benchmark
3452317 until consumers are presented with a clear cut simple and inexpensive value model for accessing mobile video and tv content it will be hard to segment audiences at either an industry or geographic level
3452318 it is difficult to create forecasts for mobile video and mobile tv advertising due to the fact that the market is still fragmented and undeveloped

3452396 theres a whole world of music that you dont hear anymore and its on 78 rpm records
3452397 i really didnt know there were so many people in the world interested in this music
3452398 a lot of younger people go to the site and its amazing that they hear songs today that originally were recorded 75 years ago its pretty cool that people get to listen to this stuff as far as copyrights apparently im okay because nobodys come to shut me down or anything
3452399 please note that what was considered humor early in the 20th century might today be deemed offensive and politically incorrect some of these old songs reflect that
3452400 my wife told me that i shouldnt put those songs on there because theyre racially offensive or sexually offensive so i asked around and people said you know first amendment do anything you want
3452401 everybody else seems to think well put them up there thats the way they are
3452402 i have an old 1950s gerard turntable that i bought at an estate sale for two and a half bucks and its got a ge general electric vr cartridge in it which is just excellent for playing 78s
3452403 i get dozens of emails every day from people telling me how wonderful it is to hear this music and people post links to my webpage on websites all over the world
3452404 we are a necessity we balance the economy without us there would be a lot of dead carcasses rotting around us homevultures offers a structured investment vehicle with low risk via the investor partnerships managed trust account we have created a safe hybrid business model that reduces risk and allows our partners to capitalize on these market conditions with speed which is crucial we call it lead pipe capitalism were certainly not the only firm to act on this opportunity but we do offer small investors the most direct access to the foreclosure market right here in south florida
3452405 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3452406 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3452407 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3452408 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3452409 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3452410 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3452411 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3452412 really you spend lots and lots of time watching her stomach to make sure its still moving parenting is weird
3452413 but but dont you think i should buy diapers or clothes
3452414 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3452415 i think the question over whether this capability works has been settled
3452416 the question is what kind of threat how large a threat how sophisticated a threat the us faces
3452417 we provided a lot of information before it took place

3452420 our main objective would be to through intelligence find out about a plot before it ever got to a stage where a nuclear device or a dirty bomb was coming our way
3452421 this provides for our defense after a plot has already been launched and a device is on its way
3452422 its a vision of how it will work if all the components come together
3452423 the importance of protecting the nations financial center will remain
3452424 and the ability to protect an urban center from a dirty bomb or a nuclear device will also remain

3452429 we look forward to meeting with our closest international partners not only to discuss our successes but also to examine continuing challenges
3452430 we had a feeling that someone was going to win the jackpot before long
3452431 our rags to riches progressive slots are among the players favorites due to the high frequency of wins by our players its an added bonus for us when one of our long time members is able to win one of these were very happy for her
3452432 this is precisely the solution that marketers have needed all along they now have complete online insight into customer interactions everything from a mouse move to an incomplete form rather than just page hit levels of information with an extremely simple deployment process
3452433 by instrumenting the site at the network level using standard network products to insert the dynamic collection code into each page speed trap can now gather absolutely every interaction between the user and the site or application in order to create a detailed customer focused session based record that is ideal for real time crm personalisation customer experience and business process monitoring applications in short we deliver the ultimate view of everything they did everything they saw and everything that happened to each user of the site or application
3452434 tagging in any form is vastly inferior to style of session based tracking it is not only a time consuming process but it is also impossible to say for certain which parts of the site are the best to tag subsequent changes are often difficult to make and the process is so long that its easy to slip into a situation where you have to maintain a legacy system packet sniffing is equally inefficient it provides an incomplete picture with data that is very hard to analyse with no visibility of most of the interaction using packet sniffer applications to do more than basic error detection of customer insight is only a few steps removed from trawling through server logs session based tracking really is the only reliable way to understand your customer
3452435 tagging falls down mainly from a logistical point of view it simply takes too long and costs too much to do even if the time issue can be ameliorated through tag automation you still only recover basic page level data so there is still the massive unspoken problem of how does a marketer know what additional data he wants to tag for
3452436 deciding what elements of the site are to be tagged is not so much a science as a stab in the dark and no tagging solution combats this fault if the wrong objects forms or clicks are monitored huge underlying site problems remain undetected and when bad things happen the users have to go back and tag some more to try to get the data they need in reality this means spending more time and money with the it department and then waiting for the tags to be deployed and the data to arrive with speed trap all that data is already available for instant analysis

3452448 there is no reason for us to succumb to the slow cell by cell demise of our parents and grandparents
3452449 the only real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes but in having new eyes
3452450 i guess what i really want is to be happy
3452451 i guess when we were first together i wasnt so critical of him all the time nowadays im obsessed with every stupid thing hes ever done and when were together it feels like im just waiting to see how hell mess things up this time in the early days i couldnt stop thinking about what a great guy he was and running through all the fun times we had together in my mind all i wanted to do was just enjoy hanging out with him
3452452 thats the kind of simplistic advice i would expect from my grandmother
3452453 once i really saw the impact of my obsessing with whats wrong and compared it to the possibility of focusing on whats right i just naturally started to do less of what wasnt working and more of what was
3452454 but what about when you were caught up in a negative spin
3452455 i either waited it out knowing it was just a low mood and would pass
3452456 sure havent you ever had a negative reaction to something but then as you learned more about it you decided that it was actually a good thing
3452457 of course when nina first told me she was pregnant i thought it was a disaster and that i was going to have to give up my work and become a plumber as soon as my son was born i realized how gloriously wrong i had been and now having kids is one of the most wonderful things in my life
3452458 we only found out ten minutes ago the entire team will stop racing not only in the tour de france we suspend the activities of the team until we understand what has happened
3452459 gianetti did a personal investigation and consequently lost faith in ricc but also in piepoli because of a violation of the teams ethics code
3452460 all our riders gave us guarantees that they were clean
3452461 ricc swore on his mothers head that he had never turned to illegal substances or means to improve his performance despite all the efforts made both internally and from outside the team we have failed to avoid this deplorable situation we are the victims of the deceitful behaviour of those who put our sponsors investments and the jobs of so many honest people at risk with the loathsome purpose of improving their cycling performance
3452462 it was a bad crisis for the world it required tough words but also a smart approach to call on the international community to step in and im very very happy that the senators request for a ceasefire has been complied with by president medvedev
3452463 there was some parts of it that didnt go so well coming out of the turn i got a whole load of water as i was trying to breathe but i got my head in there and my hand on the wall
3452464 i dont think we want to take a program designed for one purpose and slowly massage it into another purpose

3452466 most of our patients take the glyburide because of its convenience however the insulin shots do regulate your sugars better and if you asked the docs for it im sure theyd be happy to give it to you
3452467 if you want to talk about jesus you came to the wrong house
3452468 when i heard about it i felt really hurt inside
3452469 i cannot believe a writer could write something like that its the not the way that we want to be portrayed we have feelings we dont like the word retard we are people were just like any other people out there we want to be ourselves and not be discriminated against
3452470 there were parts of the movie where i laughed but it seems to me that the movie tried really hard to go too far and then pull back on everything that was offensive except the issue of people with intellectual disabilities i just think ben stiller and the people involved in this movie just didnt think it was going to be offensive
3452471 no changes or cuts to the film will be made
3452472 when i heard about it i felt really hurt inside
3452473 you own your feelings only you can allow them to be hurt
3452474 i just think ben stiller and the people involved in this movie just didnt think it was going to be offensive
3452475 but i thought id get it tested first to see what it needed before i spent all the money on it
3452476 i wouldnt even bother putting it in for the test without the tyres on it mate

3452510 jangan kaget kalau aku berkata begitu ini namanya objektif memang kenyataannya demikian charles francis potter mengatakan seperti itu bahkan jujur kukatakan jauh lebih dimuliakan dan dihargai daripada kitab suci lainnya ia lebih dihargai daripada perjanjian baru dan perjanjian lama pendeta j shillidy dalam bukunya the lord jesus in the koran memberikan kesaksian seperti itu dan pada kenyataannya tak ada buku atau kitab di dunia ini yang dibaca dan dihafal oleh jutaan manusia setiap detik melebihi di mesir saja ada sekitar sepuluh ribu mahad al azhar siswanya ratusan ribu bahkan jutaan anak mereka semua sedang menghafalkan karena mereka tak akan lulus dari mahad al azhar kecuali harus hafal aku saja yang seorang koptik suka kok menghafal bahasanya indah dan enak dilantunkan
3452511 aku hafal surat maryam dan surat al maidah di luar kepala
3452512 fahri aku geli sekali mendengar perkataan doktor dari sorbonne itu dia itu orang arab juga muslim tapi bagaimana bisa mengatakan hal yang stupid begitu aku saja yang koptik bisa merasakan betapa indahnya dengan alif laam miim nya kurasa rangkaian huruf huruf seperti alif laam miim alif laam ra haa miim yaa siin nuun kaf ha ya ain shaad adalah rumus rumus tuhan yang dahsyat maknanya susah diungkapkan maknanya tapi keagungannya bisa ditangkap oleh mereka yang memiliki cita rasa bahasa arab yang tinggi jika susunan itu dianggap sebagai suatu ketidakberesan orang orang kafir quraisy yang sangat tidak suka pada dan memusuhinya sejak dahulu tentu akan mengambil kesempatan adanya ketidakberesan itu untuk menghancurkan dan tentu mereka sudah mencela bahasa habis habisan sepanjang sejarah namun kenyataannya justru sebaliknya mereka mengakui keindahan bahasanya yang luar biasa mereka menganggap bahasa bukan bahasa manusia biasa tapi bahasa yang datang dari langit jadi kukira doktor itu benar benar stupid tidak semestinya seorang doktor sekelas dia mengatakan hal seperti itu
3452513 wah pendapat yang terlintas begitu saja dalam benak kok bisa sama dengan pendapat mayoritas ulama tafsir ya

3452545 iphones success raised the bar of consumer expectations regarding mobile multimedia
3452546 handset manufacturers worldwide are in the midst of revamping their product lines against this new benchmark

3452634 there was a failure of supervision by senior officials in the department and there was a failure on the part of some employees to cry foul when they were aware or should have been aware of problems
3452635 even if it is true they didnt commit a crime it would be appropriate to make what they did a misdemeanor so that in the future those who violate the civil service laws cannot escape unscathed

3452770 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century

3452772 the united states senate is one of our forefathers most brilliant democratic inventions
3452773 to preserve our vibrant democracy for future generations i believe it is critical to have a place where citizens can go to learn firsthand about the senates important role in our system of government
3452774 the center expected to have closer links to umass boston than the presidential library will help boost the stature of a campus that has long sought to establish a distinct identity apart from its reputation as a commuter school

3452781 with polls showing obama dominating among those under 40 and running even among middle aged voters republican john mccains lead among those 65 and older is the main reason he remains close overall
3452782 his margin is largest among older white voters without a college education accounting for much of obamas problem with the white working class
3452783 surveys and interviews suggest that older voters think mccain who will turn 72 this month comes far closer than obama 47 to sharing their values and outlook on the world and on the changes in the nation over the past half century

3452788 the price of oil can be between 50 and 200 a barrel there are tremendous ups and downs in the oil market and that will change things
3452789 its all lip service until you see a car on the road
3452790 and yes the price will come down when it scales
3452791 i tried an early version of this interface out on my trip and it was great although my pronunciation wasnt
3452792 so every now and then i would just hold up my phone to let people read what i couldnt if youre wondering about data costs i found i could get between 200 and 400 translations in 1mb of data download
3452793 although we dont charge for this service your carrier may charge for the data usage so be sure to know what your roaming rates are for my plan i found that i could translate 400 phrases for less than us 10 when roaming internationally

3452799 as a president of georgia i am in a very difficult situation in front of you yesterday i saw with my own eyes our land bombed and realized i can do noting at that moment to defend my nation from that
3452800 the countries and organisations from which we expected aid have fallen short of expectations we received help from countries and organisations from which we hadnt expected it
3452801 we shall do everything to make tskhinvali and sukhumi ours in ten hundred or thousand years
3452802 the israelites were looking for their land for 2000 years and tried to create their own state and they achieved their aim
3452803 it is completely incomprehensible for us why the state authorities of belarus are keeping silent timidly
3452804 and as for us we always share your distress in international organisations including when economic sanctions are imposed when on initiative of some countries international organisations start to discuss absence of human rights in belarus vocal statements by russia always follow after that
3452805 one should express ones opinion on such issues more clearly and especially its true for allies
3452806 we understand that the constitution of belarus prohibits using military force outside the territory of the country but the humanitarian constituent could be present
3452807 det kan v re halv nsket nkning halv virking eller ogs er jeg bare blevet bedre til at b rste t nder
3452808 until now an idea to leave tbilisi never occurred to me it is still rather calm in the city yesterday after reports that russian troops are nearing tbilisi a panic struck the city many people wanted to leave long queues at petrol station formed prices for foodstuffs rose people were saying that they do not know whether they are to live to see next morning but today everything seems quiet but certainly air communications with batumi and tbilisi are unavailable banks do not work today to say the truth we belarusians living in tbilisi wanted to carry belarusian flags with us all the time and speak belarusian only in order not to be mistaken for russian we wouldnt like to be considered russians
3452809 yesterday i was in a suburb of tbilisi with my wife and daughter we saw many military men when we heard that russian troops are attacking we went to the city immediately my relatives live in gori they told us a lot russian mass media are lying in reality they bombed gori and more than once as i have been told russian planed were bombing gori tv centre journalists are killed including a journalist from the netherlands i am distressed for my relatives they left for borjomi because of bombing having taken almost no things we are deeply grieving because of these events russians can certainly occupy georgia but that wont decide anything we would never surrender the georgian nation was always fighting for freedom freedom is the best thing we achieved we are proud of being free i have many clients in russia and we have good relations why should we be at war hate is incite by the russian tv in autumn i took part in protest rallies against saakashvili policies but today i am with him he is my president and all the oppositional leaders think the same now today we all are one one nation now russian mass media inform that the russian army hasnt entered the territory of georgia it is untrue they were at 40 of the territory in the khodori gorge a courageous brave people the svans are being slaughtered now i am a pacifist by nature war is awful but i have already volunteered the country must be defended
3452810 on september 1 the extended session of the political council of the united democratic forces will take place
3452811 the visit was a part of the osces office commitments in the area of monitoring of legal proceedings
3452812 the head of the osce office havent met with us in minsk so i do not know what they discussed but i hope it is connected to the issue of my fathers release somehow
3452813 the trial was in fact held behind the closed doors
3452814 we hadnt been told when the trial started our witnesses were not present in the court the lawyer hadnt managed to arrive yet we saw liudmila only when she was taken out of the court building she could just shout to us that she had been sentenced to 10 days of arrest
3452815 according to information he has the operation is developing in line with the plan we have
3452816 however over these several days bombardment and air raids continued that is why it is hard to say how many people are left
3452817 the ambassador came to minsk on july 1 he is now on holiday and will return at the end of the month
3452818 this is the first time that slovakia has appointed an ambassador to belarus who will permanently work in minsk
3452819 this decision may seem risky considering the fact that belarus is a country where ambassadors are sometimes thrown out but we made this step in a hope that it would help improve our bilateral ties and also in the context of relations between belarus and the european union
3452820 while belgium is bleeding and hoping while poland suffers and dreams of liberation while serbia is waiting for redemption there is a little country the soul of which is torn to pieces a little country that is so remote so remote that her ardent sighs cannot be heard it is the country of perpetual sacrifice the country that saw abraham build the altar upon which he was ready to immolate his only son the country that moses saw from a distance stretching in beauty and loveliness a land of promise never to be attained the country that gave the world its symbols of soul and spirit palestine
3452821 when you have two qbs you dont really have any
3452822 the internet glorious as it is should be thought of as the plague of postmodernity
3452823 it is the generic packaging and selling of unique works of art i think industry mediocrity is more of a threat to the future of reading than television is
3452824 the dog run at 56th street and woodside avenue in woodside queens is frankly a disgrace to dog runs everywhere tucked away behind public school 11 in an elevated corner of doughboy plaza its less a dog run than a small squarish pit of dust
3452825 michael phelps is fast yes but shouldnt we all being paying more attention to his enormous cock
3452826 more than 2000 dwellers of tskhinvali were killed the leader of the republic south ossetia kokojty said
3452827 the tv channel euronews is broadcast according to the principle
3452828 the civilian death toll continues to mount as fighting escalates between georgia and russia over the breakaway georgian region of south ossetia georgian officials said 60 people had died in the town of gori when russian planes attacking a nearby military base hit two apartment buildings
3452829 russias ambassador to georgia said that at least 2 000 civilians have died in south ossetias provincial capital
3452830 at least 2 000 civilians in tskhinvali have died over the two days military conflict in south ossetia these are figures reported by russian ambassador to georgia vyacheslav kovalenko on saturday
3452831 in the evening south ossetia president eduard kokojty said to interfax news agency that georgian troops attempted a second storm of tskhinvali at daytime but it was fought off
3452832 to find guilty on such grounds is rather wild for me to say the truth we shall challenge the verdict in any case though we do not have many illusions mr zeltsers state of health is very bad this verdict amounts to an execution
3452833 russia has lost a moral right for peacekeeping in abkhazia and south ossetia when bypassing the leadership of sovereign georgia openly chummed up de facto authorities of these breakaway regions
3452834 and now having shed all the vestiges of respectability having brought airborne units into georgia bombing territories which are not a part of the former south ossetia autonomous republic russia has become a part in an armed conflict
3452835 never again a country bordering on the zone of the conflict should receive a peacekeeping mandate
3452836 it inevitabely becomes a part of the conflict and often incites its escalation
3452837 parliamentary elections if the regime would continue repressions against candidates of the bpf and the democratic forces and about resolute disagreement of the bpf party with the attempt of some european politicians to find agreement with lukashenka
3452838 the gist of the foreign political resolution is in voice dissent with the ideas expressed by some european mass media and some european politicians that understanding should be achieved with lukashenkas regime and that demands to democratize belarus should be dropped
3452839 the congress has demonstrated that the position of lyavon barshcheuski in the bpf is stable and attempts of factional infighting do not have future at the same time barshcheuski stated that he is not against mikhalevichs being reinstated in the party as a rank and file member he even offered to vote on this proposition at the congress though mikhalevich said be does not need such a decision of the congress and he can present documents to join the primary organisation again
3452840 we have set forth conditions under which the bpf party wont take part in the elections
3452841 we havent announced boycott of the vote at once as our activists wanted to work with the voters wanted to try their hand to analyze actions of the regime and to see for themselves that the regime does not allow carrying out a normal electoral campaign stealing of election rigging of belarusian citizens will expression is the major problem that is why including pro democracy activists into district electoral commission where this rigging is taking place is so important if pro democracy activists wont be invited into district electoral commissions votes of people wouldnt be counted and then taking into streets and squares is a practical alternative to going to a polling station ones voice could be heard at the square
3452842 unstoppable repressions and pressure on democratic parties and public initiatives
3452843 preserves right to use the constitutional right for peaceful protest against rigged election results and attempts to appoint 110 deputies of the
3452844 we were very effective in the supreme court of the 13th convocation
3452845 the whole pack of economic draft laws was initiated and prepared by members of the faction
3452846 the election platform has been agreed upon a decision has been taken that the party will take part in the election till the end we havent supported the idea of the boycott the congress has unanimously adopted the decision to go all the way
3452847 e zeltser constantly complains about his health he says that its difficult for him to walk upstairs to the court building and police guards carry him in arms to the third floor
3452848 the body of the person who had been taking medicines all his life and who is not given pills now is simply dying slowly

3452852 what can have an impact on the russians without damaging us more than them
3452853 this is the first time ever that an american presidents request was rejected because france and germany stuck together
3452854 might have been viewed as a green light by russia for its attacks on georgia i urge the nato allies to revisit the decision
3452855 a country that has such problems and is led by a hot headed militant does not belong in nato
3452856 it could take the whole alliance hostage and start the third world war
3452857 austria must judge what is to be done to clear up her relations with serbia whatever austrias decision may turn out to be austria can count with certainty upon it that germany will stand behind her as an ally and friend
3452858 austria is now going to come to a reckoning with serbia we have not at the present time forced austria to a decision but neither should we attempt to stay her hand if we should do that austria would have the right to reproach us with having deprived her of her last chance of political rehabilitation and then the process of her wasting away and of her internal decay would be still further accelerated her standing in the balkans would be gone forever the maintenance of austria and in fact of the most powerful austria possible is a necessity for us that she cannot be maintained forever i willingly admit but in the meanwhile we may be able to arrange other combinations
3452859 if it is a war for russia it will most certainly be a war for france also
3452860 the french ambassador paleologue upon the instructions of his government informed the minister of foreign affairs sasonov of the complete readiness of france to fulfil her obligations as an ally
3452861 to hasten our armaments and to assume that war is probably inevitable
3452862 please express to the french government our sincere gratitude for the declaration which has been officially made to me in its name by the french ambassador that we can count fully upon the assistance of our ally france in the existing circumstances this declaration is especially valuable to us

3452869 petroleum consumption wont all of a sudden start growing after 12 straight months of losses
3452870 consumers have seen the high prices and theyre becoming wary
3452871 gas prices would need to come down to under 3 a gallon and stay there for at least six months
3452872 consumers want proof that prices will stay low for a while
3452873 people are not going to rush to the dealer to buy hummers again the energy shock was beneficial in the longer term to our psychology
3452874 volatility makes the environment for investing a little more difficult

3452877 wall street after two terms of a business friendly republican president self immolated on a pyre of greed incompetence and excessive optimism
3452878 life is a series of problems do we want to moan about them or solve them
3452879 bubbles are primarily social phenomena until we understand and address the psychology that fuels them theyre going to keep forming
3452880 few people seem immune to boom thinking the recent bubble grew so large partly because the very people responsible for the financial systems oversight came to share the general publics rosy expectations
3452881 economists expect 2008s second half to be worse than first
3452882 surging export growth coupled with falling demand for imports added 2 4 percentage points to second quarter growth in u s gross domestic product marking the largest contribution in nearly three decades without that contribution gdp would have slipped 0 5
3452883 potash at 150 arch coal at 40 and agrium agrium at 60
3452884 overall i like the action when i take a step back away from the head spinning daily action
3452885 there is no doubt that we are going to continue to hear bottom calling in the financial and bank sector in fact this sector is so oversold that we are likely to see a sharp bounce in next week or two still i highly doubt that the bounce will even make it to the downtrend line

3452950 not saying this isnt a good story and maybe even good news but a reliance on unattributed and or
3452951 concerned about news media that publish or broadcast stories reports news releases and interviews prepared or paid for by hospitals
3452952 editorial cutbacks along with pressure on hospitals to market profitable services may be eroding standards established by the groups codes of ethics
3452953 in several recently reported cases local hospitals have exerted editorial control by supplying pre packaged stories and other content to news organizations in some but not all cases hospitals paid for this special influence
3452954 a maryland newspaper sold its weekly health page to a local hospital and put the hospital in charge of providing content the arrangement was halted amid community protest after just one published issue
3452955 airing of hospital produced segments with hazy branding or no branding at all leading viewers to believe the local station reported the story
3452956 arrangements in which television or radio stations or newspapers hand over editorial decision making to hospitals violate the principles of ethical journalism and betray public trust content produced by hospitals does not fulfill the duty of news organizations to provide the public with independent medical reporting
3452957 distinguish news from advertising and shun hybrids that blur the lines between the two

3452970 inform west coast viewers that the event was only live on the east coast
3452971 well publicized recent reports that some people at the justice department in the past few years failed to observe professional standards and violated civil laws that govern the hiring of career employees and summer law interns
3452972 the mission of the justice department is the evenhanded application of the constitution and the laws enacted under it that mission has to start with the evenhanded application of the laws within our own department some people at the department deviated from that strict standard and the institution failed to stop them
3452973 encourage them to apply for any vacancies at the department
3452974 some commentators have suggested that we should criminally prosecute the people found in the reports to have committed misconduct where there is evidence of criminal wrongdoing we vigorously investigate it and where there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime we vigorously prosecute but not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
3452975 a report by agence presse france from this years defcon hacker convention in las vegas centered on comments from security analyst cameron hotchkies
3452976 the article goes on to explain that an increase in windows ports and iphone jailbreaks are evidence that users should start to be worried about hackers and malware
3452977 the truth is that increased scrutiny could lead hackers to target mac os x but users jailbreaking an iphone or a windows developer porting poorly written code to mac os x isnt going to lead to rampant malware problems overnight users jailbreak iphones to add software capabilities that arent approved by apple a bad windows port is not likely to sell in very high numbers on a mac
3452978 your interaction with us and your perceptions of us as a result are important
3452979 weve got more violence and now we dont know who to talk to about it
3452980 we are deeply concerned because it leaves the radical extremist outfits free to do what they like not merely on the pakistan afghanistan border but clearly our side of the border too
3452981 its not like theres suddenly going to be a war between the two countries
3452982 in the absence of greater trust you will see a kind of pincer movement against pakistan by afghanistan and india and pakistans establishment and state turning toward whatever tools it has at its disposal to defend itself
3452983 we made more progress in terms of peace than we have in the past 60 years
3452984 how can we get talks back on track if the prime minister the other people we meet with cant control the military the intelligence services
3452985 india did not try to draw mileage on that and get an outline for a real agreement
3452986 there are a number of impressive potential vice presidential candidates and this is a singular decision for one person and that is barack obama
3452987 but personally id be hopeful in the list of serious candidates to be considered would be chuck hagel whether it be for the veep position or a serious position in an obama administration
3452988 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
3452989 while thereve been a lot of flaws in this years primary process it is simply impressive how a candidates unusual gifts have come forth with a singular commitment to recapture the american dream
3452990 because the wilsons have failed to state constitutional claims for which relief may be granted and failed to exhaust their administrative remedies as required we affirm the judgment of the district court dismissing the wilsons amended complaint in its entirety
3452991 basically seemed to find there is no remedy for what cheney rove and libby did
3452992 catch 22 of being told to file suit under a law that does not apply to the perpetrators
3452993 if this decision can stand then government officials can be protected for sacrificing intelligence operatives and national security in the name of politics

3453013 this is like a voiceover for a cartoon character why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3453014 they want the best looking people to represent the face of china i dont blame the organizers for picking a prettier looking kid over the not so pretty one

3453020 madden s the sports gaming superpower though so its hard not to nitpick some of this stuff but even with the listed complaints this is a football game that one ups the stakes between the sidelines and its so visually impressive that its likely to stick in your system all season long even on saturdays
3453021 despite all the this cool stuff madden commits some penalties the game supposedly has more dynamic camera angles but youll often see the same one repeat up to ten times per game as for the computer it often makes strange decisions such as running out the clock when it needs a score or wandering out of bounds for no reason
3453022 i think it is about time to have our reference price
3453023 while it may not be an answer to the problem of homelessness it certainly raises questions and challenges our ideas we also are intrigued by ideas for living with less and nobody does so like the homeless smart camping equipment manufacturers should look closely
3453024 i designed the shelter cart in coordination with barry sheehan of sharc design for the designboom social awareness award 2006 the aim of the project was to design a tool for a particular group of homeless people who collect bottles from the streets so they can collect a small income from the recycling plants in order to sustain themselves the project was not seen a solution to the social problem of the homeless but instead as an method of raising awareness about the issue

3453047 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3453048 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3453049 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3453050 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3453051 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3453052 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3453053 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3453054 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3453055 on october 3rd 1938 hitlers armies marched into sudentenland a part of czechoslovakia germany said it was responding to separatist demands from the large german population that lived there and that she was merely honoring their desire for reunion with germany hitlers tanks took over a vital part of an independent country that had largely rejected his overatures and allied itself with the west neither britain or france nor the united states did a thing to stop him

3453067 aside from the challenge to develop an innovative title with spectacular levels and new controls the focus in cursed mountain is the overwhelming environment of the himalayas
3453068 it is really important to us that the player experiences natures powers as realistically as possible and that the games viewing distance allows the player to see the monumental landscapes at all times we are also going to great lengths to make the dead souls look as convincing as possible in order to deliver the level of immersion necessary for really effective and believable survival horror

3453077 the russians and president medvedev confirmed this to me have no intention of remaining in georgia
3453078 we dont yet have peace but we have a provisional cessation of hostilities and everyone should be aware that this is considerable progress there is still much work to be done what we want is to secure the best result
3453079 could europe participate in a european peacekeeping force obviously we are entirely ready to consider this kind of participation if the various actors desire it
3453080 they say they have achieved their strategic goals to keep the peace to restore order but it is unclear how that fits in to the eu four point plan of withdrawing troops to pre operation levels
3453081 our peacekeepers are continuing to perform their duties and will continue to perform their duties because they are a key factor for upholding security in the caucasus
3453082 that has been the case and that will continue to be the case
3453083 we have left kodori there was an evacuation there were no casualties

3453086 val should be on this beautiful summer day enjoying the rest of this summer
3453087 by grace you have been saved by faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not by works lest any man should boast
3453088 also the mercy of god is reckoned among those things because it removes sins but it is better that it should be removed all together
3453089 it is a more excellent benefit to preserve one from evil than to permit one to fall into it and then free such
3453090 therefore if christ has reconciled us most perfectly to god he has merited that this most grave punishment itself be taken from someone his mother
3453091 to me vocatum is a place where the name of jesus is highly and consistently exalted and where we find our calling in the shadow of the cross

3453112 do you want to know why i use a knife a gun is too quick you cant savor all the little emotions
3453113 by 2006 after major advances in seismic technology and deepwater drilling techniques the mms resource estimate for that area had ballooned to 45 billion barrels
3453114 the notion that oil companies are just sitting on oil leases is a myth with oil prices still above 100 a barrel that charge never made sense
3453115 according to the mms between 1993 and 2007 there were 651 spills of all sizes at ocs facilities in federal waters three miles or more offshore that released 47 800 barrels of oil with 7 5 billion barrels of oil produced in that time that equates to 1 barrel of oil spilled per 156 900 barrels produced
3453116 if it is acceptable to drill in the caspian sea and in developing countries such as
3453117 these fiber network cables run into the fvm control closets where the fiber lines go to network switches since confidential data i e credit cards are transmitted along these lines it is highly important that they be physically secured
3453118 note that we absolutely are not disclosing everything we found in the report
3453119 we have no intention to allow anyone in any way to defraud the mbta
3453120 the mit undergraduates apparently on the advice of counsel continue to decline to provide their defcon presentation materials or other materials that would allow an individual reasonably skilled in the art to evaluate whether the mit undergrads in fact have compromised or are able to compromise the mbtas fare media system
3453121 key information needed to compromise both the charlie ticket and the charlie card is not present in the slides
3453122 the slides depict a field called checksum and show that it changes when the ticket value changes but do not describe how to compute the checksum
3453123 so i think im a little quicker than i was before
3453124 he picks it up fast hes not a tempo guy hes a full speed guy he goes hard and hes smart and hes tough and he likes football
3453125 regrettably the university did not seek appropriate approvals at that time prior to launching the program last month sacs denied approval for nccu to continue the program offerings at the new birth site
3453126 i can think of no justifiable reason why the former nccu leadership would have completely ignored and failed to abide by the appropriate approval process in creating this program
3453127 such action is contrary to all university policy to say the least it is very disappointing we are working closely with chancellor charlie nelms and his new leadership team to examine the various academic legal and financial questions associated with this georgia based program
3453128 the idea is to get people certified for jobs even if theyre not north carolinians
3453129 it should have been presented to the unc systems board of governors as a distance learning program
3453130 it was not an easy approval it was a close fight
3453131 i was not very happy we never thought it through we needed time to study but it got pushed through
3453132 eventually if youre running for office anywhere youve got to stop by new birth
3453133 on august 13th between 8 30 10 am swedish time you can hear anders frid n as the

3453136 to take my work seriously would be the height of folly
3453137 i dont want teachers going back to school with this concept hanging over their heads
3453138 saya dari dulu menyatakan tidak over apalagi ambisi semuanya berjalan apa adanya sekarang waktunya untuk menunggu apa yang akan diputuskan oleh mendagri bagi saya setiap tugas adalah amanah
3453139 saya tetap berasumsi baik terhadap keadaan yang terjadi tetapi kenyataan akan terlihat mana politik yang cerdas dan mana politik ambisi dan memaksakan kehendak semuanya terletak bagaiman menginterpretasi aturan yang ada
3453140 saya melihat soal kematangan politik seseorang bagaimana ia harus tetap tegas di atas koridor mekanisme yang ada dalam tatib pp 151 tahun 2000 dan uu nomor 22 tahun 2003 jika itu sudah mantap maka tidak ada alasan untuk tidak melaksanakan paripurna
3453141 ini akibat dari kepentingan dan ambisi sehingga lembaga yang seharusnya berpikir tentang kemajuan daerah justru hanya melahirkan ketidakpastian membuat aturan kemudian melanggarnya
3453142 kebenaran itu relatif jika itu hasil dari pemikiran manusia persoalannya siapa yang berkuasa dan itulah yang akan menang tak ada kebenaran mutlak kecuali dari allah swt maka apapun logikanya mencari pembenaran terhadap celah yang tampak maupun tak tampak di peraturan yang ada adalah sebuah cermin kematangan demokrasi yang kita miliki
3453143 id seen the show a shot at love and just needed to meet her and it just happened
3453144 they asked me why i was going to kuanjie protestant church to worship and threatened me saying you are not allowed to go to kuanjie protestant church because president bush is going there today
3453145 they confiscated my bible and thereupon began their watch over me i prayed after about four or five hours when i saw that the people who were watching me had all fallen asleep i fled
3453146 wanted to see bush he had something he wanted to talk to him about
3453147 laura and i just had the great joy and privilege of worshiping here in beijing
3453148 you know it just goes to show that god is universal and god is love and no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
3453149 chinese citizens have freedom of religion these are indisputable facts
3453150 its an incident that opens a whole powerful window on religious repression in china its not just against the christians its against the tibetans its against the uighurs and the outlawed falun gong practitioners
3453151 hey babes listen im going to get some groceries after work do we need condoms
3453152 it had to be some sort of bad dream that these two giants would die on the same weekend and both would be in my movie
3453153 you are about to witness a truly petty act of vengence perry the platypus
3453154 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile but is morally treasonable to the american people
3453155 government has a final responsibility for the well being of its citizenship if private cooperative endeavor fails to provide work for willing hands and relief for the unfortunate those suffering hardship from no fault of their own have a right to call upon the government for aid and a government worthy of its name must make fitting response
3453156 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors
3453157 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
3453158 all men having power ought to be distrusted to a certain degree
3453159 i believe in human dignity as the source of national purpose in human liberty as the source of national action in the human heart as the source of national compassion and in the human mind as the source of our invention and our ideas it is i believe the faith in our fellow citizens as individuals and as people that lies at the heart of the liberal faith for liberalism is not so much a party creed or set of fixed platform promises as it is an attitude of mind and heart a faith in mans ability through the experiences of his reason and judgment to increase for himself and his fellow men the amount of justice and freedom and brotherhood which all human life deserves
3453160 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid
3453161 because we believe in the privacy and equality of women we stand proudly for a womans right to choose consistent with roe v wade and regardless of her ability to pay we stand firmly against republican efforts to undermine that right at the same time we strongly support family planning and adoption incentives abortion should be safe legal and rare
3453162 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right the democratic party also strongly supports access to affordable family planning services and comprehensive age appropriate sex education which empower people to make informed choices and live healthy lives we also recognize that such health care and education help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions the democratic party also strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and post natal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
3453163 there are millions of evangelicals and catholics who rightly expect their own moral convictions on abortion to be included and respected in the party
3453164 the new democratic party platform takes a significant step forward in affirming women whose moral convictions lead them to make a different decision than abortion when facing this difficult choice
3453165 stations are very interested in making this a profit center
3453166 the general managers say they will embrace mobile sell it and push the salespeople
3453167 why didnt you answer me i sent you a message yesterday about going to that midnight the other day while browsing the mobile version of youtube i serendipitously called up old ernie mobile mythology suggests that all europe and asia are far far ahead of the u s in the sheer volume and relentlessness of commentary on the iphone 3g is enough to swear me why is podcasting so difficult to explain is there something inscrutable here i am missing from brands are all about consistency reliability familiarity but at the same time their strategies have to now that the iphone app store is open for business we have to consider what kind be the focus group dad

3453180 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country

3453184 we have deployed all resources to make sure we catch them
3453185 despite the russian presidents claims earlier on tuesday morning that military operations against georgia have been suspended at this moment russian fighter jets are bombarding two georgian villages outside south ossetia
3453186 we will need more evidence everyone in this situation needs a signed binding agreement
3453187 until that happens we are mobilised we are prepared for everything
3453188 i do appreciate it medvedevs gesture but there has been more damage to infrastructure and civilian casualties today
3453189 it could be that the executive order hasnt trickled down to the rank and file or it could mean something else
3453190 finally the international community began to speak with one voice and is beginning to get the message through that this behaviour is unacceptable
3453191 president saakashvili has signed the four point kouchner plan which is being discussed in moscow right now signing that would be a start
3453192 someone started screaming ikwerekwere a derogatory name for foreigner and the next thing there were angry people beating me up with hard objects for no reason
3453193 i became unconscious and woke up in king edward viii hospital with a head injury and bruises
3453194 those who fled the congo are looked upon as traitors whichever way you look at it it would seem we are doomed
3453195 if it did happen it would have been done by an individual and not a group of people because we have been addressing this issue and people dont seem to have a problem with them returning i would say that it is safe for them to come back
3453196 as far as i know most of the foreign members of our community have been returning to their homes safely
3453197 brendon hardly looks a year older than he did back in the first film which was set nearly 20 years earlier and youll see why any geek worth their salt would snort derisively
3453198 fell short of the categorical retraction of the imputation of anti semitism that i insisted upon
3453199 in which a teacher played by nicolas cage opens up a time capsule that holds predictions to things that have already happened and events that are about to take place cbr news caught up with the director last month at comic con international in san diego to talk to him about the film
3453200 its a very different film for me because its very real
3453201 it feels very gritty and real and its very naturalistic and that was really important to me to make it that way so its not really about the visuals as such its just about the atmosphere and the emotion and i think i am more about atmosphere than visuals i mean visuals i can take them or leave them and sometimes visuals help you tell a story and other times they dont other times they get in the way so this is a very conscious effort to do something quite stylistically different for me
3453202 i am very blase i think a lot of people are very blase towards cgi these days
3453203 the plane crash scene in the movie is actually quite interesting because i wanted to do this entire scene in one shot
3453204 my idea about that was to put you right into the situation almost like youre a documentary crew following nic through this carnage so essentially in one shot you get this he sees the plane the plane crashes off into the field and we follow him into the wreckage of people on fire and he has to save people and part of the thing is blowing up and its all one continuous two minute take i did that specifically to not let the artifice of visual effects and all the cuts and stuff we can do get in the way of the emotion of the scene and i believe it works quite well i showed the scene to people and people dont actually realize that its one shot i go you realize that youve seen one take from the moment he sees the plane right up till the end of the scene and no one actually realizes it but i think they are kind of disturbed by what they are experiencing so i took that as a positive as i like to disturb people
3453205 it took us two days to set up and two days to shoot
3453206 there is no way this is going to work i am going to admit defeat in a moment
3453207 nics great hes a really sweet guy and obviously an immensely talented actor
3453208 we had a great time i think its probably the best fun ive had making a movie because we got along really well hes very subtly funny which is great he has a similarly twisted sense of humor to my own so we were very much on the same page we were very good collaborators hopefully well get the chance to do more stuff together
3453209 well essentially ryne pearson came up with the original spec script
3453210 snowden and white were writers that came in when i was first involved with the project the main development of the script was stuart hazeldine and myself to a certain extent as i changed the script enormously ive been involved with this project for about five years so i really took it in a very different direction from the first draft that i read the first draft i read was really the hook of the movie which is the unearthing of this time capsule with information
3453211 you ask people if you could know the day that you were gonna die would you want to know that would you want to know that information and people are very conflicted about having that knowledge you know that if youre given this information somehow its right in front of you then what do you do with it can you change the parameters about whats going to occur can you effectively change your destiny i think thats really an intriguing notion
3453212 i really want people to be the judge of that
3453213 at the best of times i really dont like talking about my movies as ive put so much into the movies that i sort of just want people to find that stuff for themselves
3453214 nicolas cages character in the movie character starts out believing there is no central meaning to our existence that the universe functions along chaotic principles and he discovers that there is actually order and there is actually meaning
3453215 its his journey back to meaning in the movie so that i guess is the central theme
3453216 taken out a window at starbucks at the eaton centre which also creeps me out
3453217 cnns rapid adoption of new technology over the years put us in the enviable position to be able to expand at a time when others are cutting back
3453218 its a bigger more distinct name for a channel that has grown in size as well as satisfaction among music hd fans
3453219 were also reinforcing that the channel is the home for an increasingly broad range of musical styles and artists in high def performances that cant be seen anywhere else we believe these changes will help our distributor partners as they continue to sell hd and strive for the best content

3453230 das waren unsere spiele das war unser turnier ich war schon so gl cklich mit dem mannschaftsgold der einzelsieg hier ist das t pfelchen auf dem i t pfelchen auf der sahnehaube
3453231 wir haben uns beklaut gef hlt und hatten noch eine medaille abzuholen die wir damals zur ckgeben mussten
3453232 ich bin unheimlich stolz auf meine teamkollegen sie haben eine fantastische leistung abgeliefert
3453233 au erdem hat mein vater vor 20 jahren in seoul sein letztes teamgold gewonnen
3453234 unsere pferde sind in einer sehr guten verfassung ein anderes ergebnis h tte mich auch gewundert
3453235 mein abraxxas hat einen super job gemacht er war fit und frisch
3453236 wir sind ein klasse team helfen uns gegenseitig wo es nur geht und versuchen stets uns gemeinsam zu verbessern
3453237 unsere beiden bundestrainer melzer und bartle halten die truppe super zusammen so f hlen wir uns oft wie mannschaftssportler
3453238 it is our choices harry that show what we truly are far more than our abilities
3453239 the love that lasts longest is the love that is never returned
3453240 what i get irritated about is they have tournaments on mothers or fathers day
3453241 i may sound crazy saying im doing this so my son can play high school ball and then college ball and maybe move on from there but were devoted to our kids
3453242 not only are kids getting into it earlier but theres a huge market with pitching hitting speed and agility lessons and everybodys swinging a worth prodigy lithium bat that costs 200
3453243 in the last 10 years or so we have seen a noticeable difference in the number of younger kids 8 and 9 years old playing travel ball
3453244 i guarantee you i spent 15 000 hotels gas food all kinds of things ive got 1 000 in bats but i love it
3453245 to a certain extent its been going on quite some time but it is getting younger and younger and im not so sure thats good
3453246 there is no way you can protect those kids arms
3453247 im a good swimmer im a really good swimmer im 36 years old im good at swimming
3453248 i could probably beat you in a race i could beat you swimming
3453249 the woman who comes to swim just challenged me to a race
3453250 i ll be right back with some ketchup for you
3453251 pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness play with your children spend time with your parents visit with grandparents take time to get medical checkups take your spouse out to dinner play another 18 there will always be time to clean the house and fix the disposal take care of the golf balls first the things that really matter set your priorities the rest is just sand
3453252 what is hidden is more interesting than what is obvious
3453253 im friendly but not really like to rest of you
3453254 i hereby surrender my attachment to the illusion of control the only control i have is in what i choose to perceive and trust in the universal creator to give me my desires should my higher self agree it is the correct path for my life to go i am open and receptive to the will of the universe
3453255 our teachers were the beatles jimi hendrix blues amp soul
3453256 we went in and played every day and all kinds of things happened little bits of chemistry happening between us its good organic music
3453257 theres a lot of guitar orchestras and some of our old trademarks but at the core of it youll hear the three of us playing people really truly playing together in the studio you dont get that much these days but you will get it on their new album
3453258 these days it has seemed to us that few people have this in mind cds by large tend to be a collection of songs often produced by different teams assembled in random sequence with the idea that folks will shuffle the order on their ipods anyway
3453259 c lebrity is really a comment on the current concept of fame success and all that goes with it getting your face on tv is enough talent doesnt really enter into the equation celebrity is an overused and devalued word today i think the song shows we have lost none of the humour of queen
3453260 we went back in and roughed up the studio version a bit i think it gives a fair idea of the kind of energy on the album
3453261 c lebrity is really a comment on the current concept of fame success and all that goes with it getting your face on tv is enough talent doesnt really enter into the equation celebrity is an overused and devalued word today
3453262 i see the song as rogers take on the increasing emphasis on fame for its own sake its quite ironic that andy warhols statement that everyone will have fifteen minutes of fame is becoming something of a reality although it may be down to fifteen seconds in todays world of instant communication
3453263 his intentions may have been good but how he went about it wasnt
3453264 we had no indication that he was trying to be malicious
3453265 just to know just to know that you love me
3453266 mom do you think youve done a good job raising me so far
3453267 choosing newcomers based on knowledge of our labour market and experience within canadian society would make canada a more attractive destination for skilled individuals from around the world
3453268 international students and skilled workers would be more likely to choose canada if they knew their time in canada and contribution to canadian society would assist in their eligibility to apply to stay permanently
3453269 with the russian and georgian media providing at times wildly different accounts of what is actually happening on the ground our listeners are depending on us for accurate objective information
3453270 our journalists are sorting through the ethnic and nationalist passions stirred up by this conflict in order to let people on both sides of the conflict know what is really taking place in their cities
3453271 the most memorable discouragement came during his residency from a pulmonologist
3453272 the particular focus of geriatrics training is the care of frail elders where understanding how to assess and determine the individuals ability to function is oftentimes every bit as important as understanding their diseases
3453273 caring for frail older people is about managing not curing a collection of overlapping chronic conditions like osteoporosis diabetes and dementia it is about balancing the risks and benefits of multiple medications which often cause more problems than they solve and it is about trying non medical solutions like timed trips to the bathroom to improve bladder control
3453274 youll get reimbursed better if you remove a wart than if you take the time to talk about how somebodys doing after their husband passed away
3453275 coordinating care its calling families its coordinating with other doctors its stuff that takes a lot of time that is frequently off hours at nights and on weekends and also cognitive care that youre not compensated for
3453276 one of 45 medicine residents decides to be a geriatrician
3453277 of 145 medical schools in the united states only 9 have departments of geriatrics few schools require geriatric courses and teaching hospitals graduate internists with as little as six hours of geriatric training
3453278 a per beneficiary per month stipend for care management paid directly to the patients designated personal physician
3453279 medicare reimbursement for cognitive evaluation and management has been losing ground compared with technological services reimbursement is also needed for telephone management coordinating care in and across various settings and communicating with family caregivers and with other health agencies
3453280 strategies to increase recruitment to the field of geriatrics need to include not only better reimbursement but also getting the word out about how satisfying and enjoyable careers in geriatrics really are physicians must see that this work is valued not only by the patients but also by society
3453281 teaching the core principles of their specialty to everyone be they surgeons or discharge planners because it is unrealistic to assume there will be enough geriatricians to go around
3453282 it was like entering the heart of a pyramid with mummies all around wat i saw blew me away it was as if the german soldiers had left only yesterday
3453283 according to rough historical data the ratio of about one contractor employee for every member of the u s armed forces in the iraq theater is at least 2 5 times higher than that ratio during any other major u s conflict although it is roughly comparable with the ratio during operations in the balkans in the 1990s
3453284 the bush administrations move to outsource large portions of the iraq war effort sets a dangerous precedent
3453285 the increasing use of private contractors restricts accountability and oversight opens the door to corruption and abuse and in some instances may significantly increase the cost to american taxpayers
3453286 i still put us at the top of the nfc
3453287 i feel confident in saying that because all the best teams are pretty much in our division the giants and cowboys are coming off great seasons and the redskins had a decent year
3453288 he had defensive linemen catching him from behind so it had to be frustrating
3453289 hes a sharp kid he has a nice feel for the game
3453290 i have made a decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities to peace
3453291 the reason lado did this is because he knew the enormous pr value that georgia would gain by going to the money people and analysts particularly since georgia is clearly the aggressor this time
3453292 lado is a former banker himself so he knew that by framing the conflict for the most influential bankers and analysts in new york that these power bankers would then write up reports and go on cnbc and argue lado gurgenidzes talking points it was brilliant and now youre starting to see the american media shift its coverage from calling it georgia invading ossetian territory to the new spin that its russian imperial aggression against tiny little georgia
3453293 dont be mistaken it is through this mad rage this bile and venom their constant desire to kill us and the permanent contradiction of powerful muscles afraid to relax that they become men
3453294 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognised border
3453295 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3453296 will work from home earn the cash without the commute
3453297 unlike some other health care trend surveys aon consultings survey reports the expected future increase in employer provided health plan claims cost before any plan changes based on the opinions of health plan actuaries
3453298 we provide this trend data to help employers evaluate the competitiveness of health insurance premium renewals for employers with self funded health plans this trend data helps them and their actuaries develop future claim estimates for budgeting purposes
3453299 but more must be done to truly stem the tide of rising health care costs this includes greater senior management support for these programs better employee communications and more consistent cooperation from the medical community
3453300 the fate of that deal rests with state regulators and if approved it stands to alter the competitive balance of the spokane wa health system sector
3453301 look for an expansion of services and a push for affiliations between health systems and physicians as this deal comes to fruition
3453302 can look out in to the chamber and see the faces of america
3453303 democrats and republicans to make sure america can sustain itself
3453304 only person whos stopping us from any movement on energy independence
3453305 said 30 years ago wed be independent how will things we in the future
3453306 we need to do the right things today to protect the future of america
3453307 congress shouldnt take a five week paid vacation when americans cant take a vacation from gas prices
3453308 american people need a strategy so were not dependent on most volatile part of world

3453338 there is insane attention being paid to every detail one woman was taking pictures of everyones hair so that if they needed to reshoot a scene later the hair would be exactly the same another persons job was to watch the scenes as they were filmed and watch for continuity

3453357 would not be in the best interest of the community
3453358 i served with sen mccain and he and i were the only two to vote against the bush cheney tax cuts
3453359 during this campaign it is a different john mccain he is saying he would make the tax cuts permanent he is advocating more drilling whereas he voted against drilling in anwr it goes to his credibility and that is such an important issue for this country plus his foreign policy has been consistently with bush cheney and i know from my perspective that is a huge issue for the united states
3453360 i think the little flare up we are witnessing in georgia is another illustration of the different approach these two men are taking
3453361 mccain is bellicose threatening to kick russia out of the g8 use force if it is required obama is far more of the traditional position turn to international institutions call for reconciliation call for an end of hostilities but also be firm in his words and thats the kind of leadership we need

3453376 si bien el n mero de prisioneros pol ticos no tiende a aumentar es visible que el gobierno contin a aplicando cada vez m s ampliamente la variante de sustituir la represi n pol tica basada en largas condenas de c rcel por procedimientos de bajo perfil
3453377 en detenciones arbitrarias sistem ticas la gran mayor a de corta duraci n
3453378 la situaci n sigue siendo desfavorable debido a que contin a prevaleciendo el monopolio casi absoluto del estado en todos los sectores exceptuando ciertos islotes de propiedad privada

3453382 there are only two places in the league first place and no place
3453383 the credit squeeze hit with force a year ago and the central bank has shoveled out billions of dollars in loans from september through april it also was aggressively cutting interest rates to keep the financial turmoil from pushing the country into a deep recession the feds interest rate setting panel met again last week and for the second meeting held interest rates unchanged amid concerns that lowering rates further could stoke inflation pressures
3453384 if it was only one this year you mightve thought it was just the person
3453385 i think they need to reassess the thing as to the strength and what its doing to people

3453402 nothing can have value without being an object of utility
3453403 i would not it depends how the drilling is put forth but i dont that is not excluded let me say it that way it depends how that is proposed if the safeguards are there now mind you 68 million acres 10 million more acres in alaska where they can drill but if theres if we can get some great things in terms of renewable energy resources a renewable electricity standard wind solar biofuels and the rest in that context because if you make a decision only to go with the offshore drilling you are increasing our dependence on fossil fuels and you will never free yourself of that addiction unless you invest in the renewable energy resources that are good for the environment cheaper for the consumer and will reverse global warming and the consumer is our first responsibility the american taxpayer owns this oil offshore by the way let me make this one final point this oil is owned by the american taxpayers the oil companies drill we give them money to drill there but we get very little in return so i think as we have this debate which is a very healthy one to have and i welcome it we have to review and realign the relationship between our oil big oils profits and what it means to the consumer and the taxpayer

3453411 ia wanita berani dan bagi lelaki ortodoks keberanian itu sendiri dianggap kejahatan melawan prinsip prinsip tunduk diri submission yang begitu disanjung dalam islam
3453412 banyak efek pengadilan syariah terhadap wanita bahrain bukan hal sepele selama bertahun tahun wanita maju ke pengadilan syariah dan hasilnya mereka ditindas dan diperlakukan secara tidak adil kami sudah mencapai titik dimana kami mengatakan
3453413 orang shiah di bahrain mengadakan perkawinan mutah perkawinan untuk kesenangan ini mengakibatkan lahirnya anak anak yang akhirnya berkeliaran di jalanan
3453414 seorang lelaki dianggap normal kalau menikahi wanita filipina bahrain ataupun isteri ketiga dari iran plus ia masih juga bisa mengambil 2 atau 3 wanita dalam perkawinan mutah berapa kalau gitu anak anak yang dihasilkan lelaki macam itu
3453415 yang penting adalah wanita dapat tinggal dan dilindungi sebuah negara yang aman jika seorang wanita tidak dapat mendapat perlindungan di negaranya sendiri tidak dapat perlindungan dari pengadilan tidak dapat perlindungan dari perkawinan kemana ia akan pergi kemana
3453416 bukannya sharia islam mensahkan perkawinan mutah bukannya sharia mensahkan mutah berdasarkan prinsip prinsip kenikmatan dari sentuhan seksual dengan pahanya dianjurkan agar lelaki mendapat kenikmatan dari sentuhan sexual kenikmatan dari sentuhan sexual dengan dadanya
3453417 bisakah anda bayangkan seorang lelaki dewasa mengadakan sex dengan gadis gadis balita dan bukannya kalian yang mengatakan kepada saya bahwa sharia mensahkan perbuatan perbuatan ini
3453418 lupakan mutah mari kita bicara tentang misyar apa arti perkawinan misyar dan anda lalu mengatakan saya sunni dan oleh karena itu menyerang shiah
3453419 apa artinya perkawinan misyar lelaki menikah dengan wanita di sebuah kota lain dan mengunjunginya sekali sebulan ia memanggilnya istri tetapi perkawinan macam ini hanyalah merendahkan harga diri wanita
3453420 seluruh hidupnya wanita itu sama seperti tahanan dalam rumahnya sendiri di jaman dulu ia tidak dapat keluar untuk bekerja ataupun untuk belajar keluar negeri hanya segelintir wanita mampu pergi ke universitas diluar bahrain ia harus dirumah memasak menyapu dan membesarkan anak anak bagaimana mungkin ia mendapatkan pendidikan banyak wanita yang keluarganya extremis mereka bahkan memaksanya agar menikah melawan kemauannya
3453421 anda bertanya mengapa sunat wanita masih dipraktekkan didunia arab mengapa karena tidak adanya pendidikan tidak adanya kesadaran beberapa hari lalu gadis empat tahun bernama anam tewas di sudan alasannya karena ia disunat empat tahun dan ia tewas karena darahnya keracunan
3453422 so what bahkan di mesjid mesjid mereka menuduh saya menghina so what kau pikir ini berpengaruh terhadap saya tidak bukan mereka melainkan allah nahhhh ini dia masih juga memuja muja allah sang pencipta syariah yang akan memutuskan apakah saya akan ke surga atau ke neraka
3453423 ini cuma metode orang lemah siapa memberi mereka hak untuk menuduh saya menghina apakah mereka melihat isi hati saya mereka melihat saya sholat atau tidak atau mungkin karena saya tidak mengenakan hijab
3453424 tuduhan menghina hakim syariah selama sebuah pembicaraan telpon hanyalah dibuat buat
3453425 semua tuduhan ini dikumpulkan sejak 2001 karena sebuah demo damai yang diorganisasikan kelompoknya 2 bulan lalu dimana kita menuntut pengunduran diri jaksa umum
3453426 saya tidak peduli kalau saya akan dipenjara karena toh kami sudah hidup dalam penjara besar saya tidak akan pernah berhenti ataupun bungkam ataupun meninggalkan posisi saya
3453427 hukum yang tidak terkodifikasi ini memberikan hakim kewenangan untuk menjatuhkan keputusan menurut penafsiran yurisprudensi islam masing masing
3453428 mengapa tidak lebih banyak feminis khususnya wanita dalam dunia islam mendukung wanita wanita seperti ini

3453452 but in order to be a good christian you have to read the bible

3453464 any producer who wants to eligible for disaster assistance on his 2009 crops corn soybeans whatever you grow next year you must have crop insurance coverage on all your insurable acres on your fall planted crops
3453465 the more crop insurance coverage you have the more your sure guarantee will be
3453466 theyre basically trying to create incentives for people to buy higher levels of crop insurance coverage
3453467 it can also be any farm where during the calendar year the total loss of production on that farm because of weather is greater than 50 of normal production on the farm

3453491 if support is provided externally like a wall for example the feeder roots which nourish the plant only need nine inches of soil and city plants should be pruned so they dont grow too tall or you may not be able to pluck the fruit easily

3453501 an immature chipset solution from infineon technologies ag may be at the root of reported connection problems with apple inc s 3g iphone nomura analyst richard windsor said in a note to clients tuesday
3453502 he said some iphone users are having trouble getting a 3g connection and hanging on to it hiccups reportedly include a high incidence of dropped calls switching onto the slower edge network while the device is stationary and loss of reception while in good coverage
3453503 windsor writes that the problem isn t likely to be solved with firmware updates which means apple could have to replace the chips so users get the performance they were promised
3453504 stephen yarbrough has a love hate relationship with his new apple iphone 3g he calls it the best gadget hes ever had but also the worst mobile phone
3453505 yarbroughs complaints stem from spotty phone reception owing to the phones 3g wireless technology he said that when the phone is set to ride on the faster 3g network the signal often fluctuates and drops calls even though it should be able to revert to a slower wireless technology called edge
3453506 he has taken to turning off his phones 3g connection when making phone calls and relying on the edge technology to maintain his conversations yarbrough upgraded his phones software last week but the problems continued he said
3453507 mark siegel an at amp t spokesman said apple and at amp t are working to ensure that users have a great experience with the iphone 3g which he said has not been a source of tremendous complaints
3453508 he said that while customer concerns are being investigated its hard to know if they are widespread or the product of individual circumstances
3453509 widespread complaints about the iphone 3gs reception have spread across the internet in the month since apple and at amp t released the successor to the original iphone the companies insist that nothing is wrong but the complaints have been mounting through e mails water cooler discussions and message boards on apples own web site iphone 3g users are having trouble connecting and staying connected to the 3g networks in their areas
3453510 repeated attempts over the past week to get apple and at amp t to even acknowledge the uproar if not the issues specifically proved pointless
3453511 its always difficult to determine the scope of an issue posted on internet message boards whether or not a loud minority is blowing up a relatively minor problem into something more
3453512 network coverage isnt the only possible cause of all these problems
3453513 users of other mobile phones on at amp ts 3g network are not reporting the same kinds of issues and iphone 3g users in the u k and australia among other places are reporting similar issues
3453514 its possible that a software problem is responsible for some of the issues if true that would actually be good news for iphone 3g owners since apple would be able to correct the issue in a subsequent update
3453515 but at this stage while its easy to theorize its almost impossible to know for sure what might be causing the problems
3453516 3g will often show a lower connection but work as well
3453517 you just gotta wonder didnt anyone at apple take a few drive around and see if the damn things work
3453518 you just want to slap him and say shut up

3453526 parliamentary blocs should show some flexibility and try to compromise to reach an agreement
3453527 i expect that the kurds would make some concessions regarding article 24 of the provincial elections law due to international and popular pressure

3453531 i may sound crazy saying im doing this so my son can play high school ball and then college ball and maybe move on from there but were devoted to our kids
3453532 not only are kids getting into it earlier but theres a huge market with pitching hitting speed and agility lessons and everybodys swinging a worth prodigy lithium bat that costs 200
3453533 in the last 10 years or so we have seen a noticeable difference in the number of younger kids 8 and 9 years old playing travel ball
3453534 i guarantee you i spent 15 000 hotels gas food all kinds of things ive got 1 000 in bats but i love it
3453535 to a certain extent its been going on quite some time but it is getting younger and younger and im not so sure thats good
3453536 there is no way you can protect those kids arms
3453537 since god sent jesus down to die for us and to cleanse our sins why do we bother to go to church to cleanse our sins
3453538 no idea why dont god send another jesus down to cleanse our sins again

3453543 taa benefits will serve as a lifeline to trw workers as they work to get back on their feet and i appreciate secretary chaos quick action on this matter
3453544 i have long been an ardent supporter of the taa program and i am hopeful these benefits will help the affected workers and their families during this time of transition
3453545 when a company decides to pull up and move to a foreign country the workers and families left behind deserve a helping hand
3453546 while the training and other assistance are essential in the short term what these workers need above all is a strong economy that produces good jobs at good wages i will continue to fight for opportunities to strengthen our economy and provide minnesota workers and families with quality jobs
3453547 trade adjustment assistance benefits are designed to help workers and families whose jobs have been sent out of the country due to no fault of their own the assistance approved today will be essential to getting families back on their feet but this no substitute for a good paying stable job there is no doubt that these workers would rather have their jobs back trws layoffs demonstrate the all too real impact of poorly designed trade deals

3453549 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3453550 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3453551 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3453552 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3453553 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3453560 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3453561 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3453562 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3453563 yet this solution is deemed unacceptable by the moral giants who run the united nations they claim that it is objectionable to employ sniff mercenaries more objectionable it seems than passing empty resolutions sending ineffectual peacekeeping forces and letting genocide continue
3453564 has a database of thousands of former police and military officers for security assignments blackwater personnel could set up perimeters and guard darfurian villages and refugee camp in support of the u n
3453565 a pretty good argument for western governments or the u n to hire blackwater or another private security company to go in and do this theres no reason for example why the u n which has already authorized peacekeepers for eastern chad but cant find the troops cant just hire a security firm to do it and call them u n peacekeepers
3453566 blackwater founder mr erik prince has a remedy he believes that with 250 or so professionals blackwater can transform about a thousand of the african union soldiers into an elite and highly mobile force this force would also be equipped with helicopters and the kind of small planes that missionaries use in this part of the world it would be cheaper than the hundreds of millions we are spending to set up a larger au u n force and he says hed do it at cost
3453567 ask a sudanese about fallujah and blackwater they wont give you a high five and ask for a free bw challenge coin
3453568 to be clear i support eriks focus and stated intention i think using his bw vehicle and lobbying efforts to inject that corporation is a very bad idea
3453569 when you have a systemic challenge like the war in darfur it requires more than a few mercenaries even very well equipped and very well trained
3453570 capacity and capabilities among our african partners so that they are able to tackle africas security challenges

3453572 strength and energy from yoga new age and cosmic energies
3453573 to love and be loved is the most beautiful thhing that can happen to a person and ones own life is much more important than all the glamour and fame in the world
3453574 with humour even when its sometimes difficult to do you can never allow yourself to lose your sense of humour life goes on and its just too wonderful to be spent singing the blues
3453575 aside from that whoever said life is going to be a cakewalk life can be incredibly hard laughs so people you better buy yourself a safety helmet
3453576 oh dear lord no certainly not im pretty doggone sure that rachel with her usually very chaotic love life would definitely not be the ideal person to take advice from
3453577 naturally courteney and i have been accompanying one another through life for quite some time now i trust her completely and she is very good at giving advice shes a good girlfriend shes got a really great family
3453578 naturally its a beautiful thing to have a family there are many things that are worthwhile i can only say that i look at the future with a great deal of optimism i will continue making movies and i hope to be able to make a few dreams come true
3453579 but much better than spending days making plans is to go out and create concrete opportunities
3453580 just feel free to say that im turning 40 next year
3453581 how about lust for life otherwise i do the best i can to keep myself fit both in body and mind i also draw a lot of strength and energy from yoga new age and cosmic energies i very much believe in karma the way you treat your fellow man is how youll ultimately be treated yourself

3453583 boy the way that sounds as if im crazy its true that i spent some time regularly taking part in sessions with a psychiatrist an absolutely fantastic woman who unfortunately died not too long ago by the way i find it to be very normal to lie on a couch every once in a while and let your head be straightened out and your hear but please dont write jennifer aniston is crazy promise lets go back to talking about the movie
3453584 it sure would be all that bad if a man when he came home and opened the door ran to his woman with his tail wagging and smooched her up this wholehearted excitement is something ive always missed in men to be quite honest
3453585 youre asking me well yes i do have some advice men and women should communicate more honestly with one another we really are very different thats why itd be important that we listen to one another sounds very simple but quite complicated in real life
3453586 i believe that wouldnt be a very good idea friends was a wonderful time in my life and is now like so many other things a chapter thats been closed lets keep looking forward
3453587 i walk and i do yoga but not the strenuous hardcore ashtanga style often i just breathe and sit in one position for ages its for relaxation the most vigorous exercise i do is running around after bluebell
3453588 i dont have a strict diet anymore i eat cake crisps sugar free chocolate and chips if i want to i cant be bothered to follow a gruelling food plan im a petite person and if i eat relatively healthily ill stay that way its simple really when i feel under pressure i do eat cake but i dont punish myself for that like i used to i just eat more healthily the next day

3453703 vmwares next big opportunity is to become the infrastructure provider for cloud computing
3453704 all of the services we provide are os and application independent users dont want the headaches of all the configuration and customization that is common today
3453705 our vision of cloud computing has to do with how enterprise computing resources become pools of resources available to a variety of applications
3453706 enterprises dont care about the application or the os as such what enterprises want are productivity and performance what they want are service levels that can be agreed upon and measured they care about performance parameters about downtime about charge backs our vision of cloud computing is that applications will become platform agnostic it wont matter where they physically reside where users access them from or even what devices those users choose

3453725 this case is so unique particular fees might be awarded defendants
3453726 the state does object to defendants request for any costs associated with the litigation of this matter since none of the costs of the suit are allowable against the state they are barred by sovereign immunity
3453727 the award of costs to a prevailing party is a right created by statue the general rule is that a statue waiving sovereign immunity which is also in derogation of common law must be strictly construed and what right of recovery is to be ascertained against the state must be expressly mentioned in the waiver of immunity statute andrade v state 448 a 2d 1293 1295 r i 1982 citing brown v grainger 36 a 720 r i 1897 none of the authority cited by the defendants either mentions or allows for the recovery of costs against the state the general assembly has not waived the states sovereign immunity for an award of costs
3453728 double standard typically operates in these types of cases state and public interest groups granted reimbursement for fees when they successfully pursue public interest litigation conversely industry successfully defending arbitrary enforcement typically is denied motions for fees which are substantial in nature
3453729 however the rhode island lead paint public nuisance case is so unique that these particular fees e g associated with responding to a special master appointed by the judge to set the remedy may actually be awarded the defendants this kind of award could serve as a means for the judicial system to admonish and deter such state sponsored fishing expeditions and to serve as a bit of a political hedge for the eventual rejection of defense motions for attorneys fees the true monte in this situation
3453730 this case is so unique particular fees might be awarded defendants
3453731 the state does object to defendants request for any costs associated with the litigation of this matter since none of the costs of suit are allowable against the state they are barred by sovereign immunity

3453747 i only signed the draft because i agreed with what was contained in it and only on the condition that after issuance of the tro there will be an oral argument because i want to listen to the parties
3453748 you said you are not surprised because walls have ears this kind of attitude is what bothers me that even a court of appeals justice will take these things for granted

3453826 would not be in the best interest of the community
3453827 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3453828 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3453829 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3453830 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3453831 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3453832 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3453833 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3453834 we have tried to find solutions on paper that would allow us short term means to achieve an agreement so that there will be a definite cessation of hostilities
3453835 i believe that they believe that they have made some progress and we welcome that and we certainly welcome the eu mediation
3453836 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3453837 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a significant and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3453838 these actions would be inconsistent with assurance that we have received from russia that its objectives were limited to restoring the status quo in south ossetia that existed before fighting began
3453839 we are in the process of invasion occupation and annihilation of an independent democratic country
3453840 please wake up everybody and please make your position and speak with a united voice
3453841 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3453850 the prime minister did not speak during our brief tribute certainly not i dont think he even looked up the snarling business of question period having just ended he was shuffling papers i tried to bring him close to me with my eyes who is this man what makes him tick no doubt he is busy no doubt he is deluded by that busyness no doubt being prime minister fills his entire consideration and froths his sense of busied importance to the very brim and no doubt he sounds and governs like one who cares little for the arts but he must have moments of stillness and so this is what i propose to do not to educate that would be arrogant less than that to make suggestions to his stillness for as long as stephen harper is prime minister of canada i vow to send him every two weeks mailed on a monday a book that has been known to expand stillness that book will be inscribed and will be accompanied by a letter i will have written i will faithfully report on every new book every inscription every letter and any response i might get from the prime minister on this website
3453851 el objetivo de la operaci n para imponer la paz se ha cumplido la seguridad de las tropas de paz y de los ciudadanos rusos est garantizada
3453852 aplastar en caso de que surjan cualquier foco de resistencia o de agresi n
3453853 el agresor ha sido castigado y ha sufrido bajas significativas sus fuerzas armadas han quedado dispersas
3453854 la declaraci n del cese de las hostilidades por parte de rusia es una buena noticia
3453855 son buenos principios que permiten salir de la situaci n actual y que valen tanto para georgia como para osetia
3453856 hemos acordado respetar la soberan a de georgia es un pa s independiente
3453857 rusia reconoce la soberan a de georgia pero esto no significa que un estado soberano pueda hacer lo que le de la gana
3453858 cuando matan a varios miles de civiles un estado debe actuar adecuadamente no pod amos actuar de otra forma y estos cinco d as demostraron que nuestra respuesta fue la m s eficaz y consecuente
3453859 a la pregunta de si osetia del sur y abjasia quieren seguir viviendo en georgia deben responder ellas mismas y su respuesta ser contundente
3453860 si georgia acepta firmar la retirada de sus tropas y cumple los seis principios la v a de normalizaci n quedar abierta
3453861 los pacificadores rusos cumplir n y seguir n cumpliendo sus funciones en el c ucaso
3453862 son un factor clave de la seguridad en el c ucaso
3453863 during the summer we have a major increase in that
3453864 with the realty crisis the way it is we also have a lot of people abandoning their houses with their dogs in the backyard
3453865 this is our first time to have a number as large as this

3453875 if foreigners found out theyd think we cant even find a girl who is good at both
3453876 we have not achieved peace yet but we have achieved a provisional cease fire of hostilities
3453877 all we need to do now is to stop suffering stop the death of people
3453878 there are bigger problems relating to south ossetia that we cannot resolve here
3453879 territorial integrity can be demonstrated by the actual facts on the ground
3453880 i think that these are some very good principles in order to resolve the problem which has arisen from this very dramatic situation and these principles can be used by georgia and south ossetia
3453881 the aggressor has been punished and has incurred very significant losses its armed forces are disorganized
3453882 i wanted to make very clear that the united states stands for the territorial integrity of georgia for the sovereignty of georgia that we support its democratically elected government and people and are reviewing options for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to georgia but the most important thing right now is that these military operations need to stop
3453883 we have had a wonderful attendance in these sessions which proved to be informative and that served as a catalyst to the question

3453893 your life is over your life is over your life is over your life is over your life is over your life is over your life is over
3453894 i have made a decision to end the operation to force the georgian authorities to peace
3453895 the operation has achieved its goal security for the peacekeepers and civilians has been restored the aggressor was punished suffering huge losses
3453896 it is understandable that russia wants to protect its compatriots and russian speakers interests abroad and it is also understandable that the international community wants to protect georgias sovereignty security and territorial integrity
3453897 russia can use its might to ensure peace this is the reason why i am in moscow
3453898 the first is not to resort to the use of force the second is to halt all military action the third is free access to humanitarian aid the fourth is that georgian armed forces should return to their bases the fifth is that russian armed forces should pull back to their positions prior to combat
3453899 the sixth is the beginning of international discussions on the future status of south ossetia and abkhazia and on ways to ensure their security
3453900 provoke a response by the russian military in order to prove to their western patrons that russia is not keeping its promises
3453901 russia supports the osce and eu line that a ceasefire agreement is absolutely essential but we have questions over several points
3453902 we can hardly agree to this as it implies that georgian so called peacekeepers should be in south ossetia georgian peacekeepers cannot be there they committed crimes shooting their own russian colleagues with whom they were serving
3453903 i think that the bucharest communique stands the allies have said in bucharest that one day georgia will join nato
3453904 has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people
3453905 the very scale of this cynicism is astonishing the attempt to turn white into black black into white and to adeptly portray victims of aggression as aggressors and place the responsibility for the consequences of the aggression on the victims
3453906 the cold war has long ended but this mentality has remained firmly in the minds of several u s diplomats
3453907 the armed forces of abkhazia have reached the border with georgia in the kodori gorge
3453908 it felt awesome it was really controlled over the first 100 and i gave it everything coming home
3453909 its not just one michael phelps lifting up the world has taken giant steps
3453910 it is difficult for us to be honest the resources that are being poured in at this level from countries that are succeeding are greater that what were able to manage
3453911 im very grateful to funding body sparc for what we get the resources are greater and the pool of swimmers you can draw from is greater too
3453912 when youve got a four million population you can have one moss but if youre in america you can have a multiple number
3453913 ive seen a lot of great swimmers dawn fraser winning three gold medals at successive olympics youve got grant hackett whos won successive 1500m another extraordinary feat
3453914 could europe be involved in a peacekeeping mission europe is available to do that of course
3453915 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
3453916 the russian state has once again shown its face its true face
3453917 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3453918 president saakashvili is the duly elected president of a sovereign democratic nation and so the determination of him as president is his decision and a decision for the georgian people and not for any outside nation to make
3453919 neither the us nor any other foreign country is physically in place
3453920 we havent announced any of the discussions that have taken place with any outside parties that are interested in the brand
3453921 jung is senile and has no criminal record but he repeatedly raped and sexually harassed several female followers who had trusted him as the messiah inflicting immense mental damage on his victims
3453922 even worse the accused took no action to mitigate their pain and show remorse for what he did
3453923 obamas running his campaign in a way an eisenhower republican would have run his campaign
3453924 i dont know how much you know about my grandfathers administration
3453925 but that administration stood for multilateral engagement balancing the budget they were the party of civil rights they were the party of environmental progress that was the republican party of the 1950s i think you can make the case that doesnt sound like the republican party we know today
3453926 the fact is that todays republican party is one with which i am totally unfamiliar to me the word republican has always been synonymous with the word responsibility which has meant limiting our governmental obligations to those we can afford in human and financial terms the republicans used to be deeply concerned for the middle class and small business todays republican leadership while not solely accountable for the loss of american jobs encourages it with its tax code and heads us in the direction of a society of very rich and very poor
3453927 they were the party of civil rights and environmental progress
3453928 the fact is that todays republican party is one with which i am totally unfamiliar

3453935 gis gives you a very good visualization method to understand what is happening in real time

3454343 im personally against abortion but i dont think it should be illegal
3454344 i think abortion takes an innocent human life and i think mothers should be legally allowed to do that to their unborn children
3454345 child abuse is wrong but i dont want to force my belief on others
3454346 men do not despise a thief if he steals to satisfy his hunger when he is starving yet if he is caught he must pay sevenfold though it costs him all the wealth of his house
3454347 so that innocent blood will not be shed in your land and
3454348 purge from israel the guilt of shedding innocent blood so that it may go well with

3454353 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3454354 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3454355 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3454356 this is like a voiceover for a cartoon character why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3454357 they want the best looking people to represent the face of china i dont blame the organizers for picking a prettier looking kid over the not so pretty one
3454358 its the unfortunate reality that these sort of things turn political
3454359 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation
3454360 domestic institutions reported having tightened their lending standards and terms on all major loan categories over the previous three months

3454363 we kind of take that with a little bit of pride
3454364 some people are nice but a lot of times its like what was it like to lose to lsu or florida
3454365 we have i think 40 guys on our rosters right now that are entering years four or five and theres a little challenge there in our eyes to make sure that those guys come back into training camp and they dont think its same old same old
3454366 i want to stress that last point because there is no denying it the system failed the active wrong doing detailed in the two joint reports was not systemic in that only a few people were directly implicated in it but the failure was systemic in that the system the institution failed to check the behavior of those who did wrong there was a failure of supervision by senior officials in the department and there was a failure on the part of some employees to cry foul when they were aware or should have been aware of problems
3454367 c ritics have suggested that we should summarily fire or reassign all those people who were hired through the flawed processes described in the joint reports but there is a principle of equity that we all learned in the schoolyard and that remains as true today as when we first heard it two wrongs do not make a right as the inspector general himself recently told the senate judiciary committee the people hired in an improper way did not themselves do anything wrong it therefore would be unfair and quite possibly illegal given their civil service protections to fire them or to reassign them without individual cause
3454368 where there is evidence of criminal wrongdoing we vigorously investigate it
3454369 and where there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime we vigorously prosecute but not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime

3454393 our new tru saver bundle puts pressure on big mobile carriers to change their outlandishly expensive pricing models
3454394 were bringing a world of change to the market just as alternative providers revolutionized pricing in wire line long distance calling truphone is revolutionizing international calling for mobile phone users because we carry the calls over available wi fi networks and the internet and roaming charges are out entirely in short truphone is bringing the first step of equal access to the mobile phone for consumers and business users this means savings and cost control that they never saw before
3454395 whether theyre calling back to the u s and canada from business trips or from foreign holidays tru saver calls can be made at the same 1 5 cents per minute from anywhere in the world
3454396 since truphone uses both wi fi and gsm networks based on whichever is available many users will actually reduce their carrier billed mobile minutes while increasing the total amount of minutes they actually spend talking thanks to truphones lower rates for calls that terminate on a wi fi connected truphone mobile phone

3454414 post this same story on a forum where professional photographers hang out and youll see how we got
3454415 there is good to him but the letters dont show there is bad
3454416 there are no injury marks on her body the girl seems mentally retarded and is changing her statement every time she is being inquired about the incident
3454417 i was informed about the appointment on the day when the team selection for the odi series was made
3454418 so jacob served seven years for rachel and they seemed only a few days because of his love for her
3454419 the publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community and could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
3454420 upcoming book jewel of medina a new attempt to slander the prophet of islam
3454421 the writer withdraws this book from the stores and apologise s to all the muslims across the world
3454422 very real possibility of major danger for the building and staff and widespread violence a declaration of war explosive stuff a national security issue far more controversial than the satanic verses and the danish cartoons and thinks the book should be withdrawn asap
3454423 the safety and security of the random house building and employees
3454424 for all those who believe the life of the prophet muhammad cant include stories of lust anger and doubt we need only read the quran 18 110 where its said god instructed muhammad to tell others i am only a mortal like you
3454425 i dont have a problem with historical fiction i do have a problem with the deliberate misinterpretation of history you cant play with a sacred history and turn it into soft core pornography
3454426 my portrayal of muhammad is extremely respectful and of the origins of islam is very accurate and respectful muhammad says in the koran that he was a mortal i assume he did all the things a man does he had 12 sure he had sex with them
3454427 as an atheist youre part of a minority whose beliefs are constantly ignored and marginalised while religious prejudice is pandered to and encouraged and you have every right to be offended by that
3454428 the invisible and the non existent look very much alike
3454429 i just believe in one fewer god than you do when you understand why you dismiss all the other gods you will understand why i dismiss yours
3454430 its an incredible con job when you think about it to believe something now in exchange for something after death
3454431 it is far better to grasp the universe as it really is than to persist in delusion however satisfying and reassuring
3454432 religious wars are basically people killing each other over who has the better imaginary friend
3454433 the fruits of christianity were religious wars butcheries crusades inquisitions extermination of the natives of america and the introduction of african slaves in their place
3454434 just because science so far has failed to explain something such as consciousness to say it follows that the facile pathetic explanations which religion has produced somehow by default must win the argument is really quite ridiculous
3454435 to explain the unknown by the known is a logical procedure to explain the known by the unknown if a form of theological lunacy
3454436 we would be 1 500 years ahead if it hadnt been for the church dragging science back by its coattails and burning our best minds at the stake
3454437 the church has opposed every innovation and discovery from the day of galileo down to our own time when the use of anesthetic in childbirth was regarded as a sin because it avoided the biblical curse pronounced against eve and every step in astronomy and geology ever taken has been opposed by bigotry and superstition the greeks surpassed us in artistic culture and in architecture five hundred years before christian religion was born
3454438 the christian mythologists tell us that christ died for the sins of the world and that he came on purpose to die would it not then have been the same if he had died of a fever or of the small pox of old age or of anything else
3454439 law enforcement officers throughout the state do a tremendous job in promoting traffic safety in their communities

3454450 the concept of operation immortality is much more than a theme to an online game the earths population needs to quickly adjust our behavior regarding global warming or else fiction quickly becomes our new reality when we learned that richard garriott will be conducting environmental research while in space the stars all aligned to support him
3454451 planet make over is about saving the planet the message is serious but the process can and should be fun
3454452 i know first hand the power that music has to unite people and i know that global warming poses a serious and pending threat to humanity
3454453 the first step is to come together and collectively change our daily habits or operation immortality becomes way too real this is the serious part the fun part is involving musicians their dna schematics of fender guitars and a record of planet strategy as part of operation immortality to set an historical benchmark of the moment the planet took action to reverse this threat to humanity
3454454 i am very excited to have rock greats such as johnson pike and bruton bringing their message to save the earth from environmental catastrophe
3454455 my current gaming project tabula rasa starts with the earth being devastated by hostile aliens however regardless of how humanity faces its doom planet make over and operation immortality are working for the same result humanitys survival

3454470 at a time when the glazers announced their retirement and given that bill has more than 20 years of experience in sports and entertainment and consumer products it was the logical choice for mr dully to run the newly formed global sports and entertainment company
3454471 i plan on focusing all of my attention on zealous trading group zlst ob and its core assets including zealous ats and its developing adult entertainment businesses
3454472 focusing on sports and entertainment is a natural fit and opportunity for me to excel in what my talents will bear and my twenty plus years in these fields have allowed me to make many connections which i plan to explore so that the expansion of this firm will continue
3454473 i plan to monetize our existing relationship with ebay to bring more profit and revenue forward for the firm
3454474 he shared in two pulitzer prizes awarded for staff coverage of the rodney king riots and the northridge earthquake
3454475 unlike the individual pulitzers on staff ones they give awards to all the writers and editors who had key roles on the stories probably more than 50 in these cases they dont inscribe names on any pulitzer trophies i dont think but certainly not on staff ones the plaques we all received for spot reporting in 1992 and 1994 are nice 5 x 7 inch lucite type rectangles with a replica of the front page embedded inside and some wording about the prize at the bottom im looking at my two right now very dusty but otherwise sort of nice looking you can come over and see them anytime
3454476 do you know what luke fords motivation was for bringing this up now
3454477 i have no idea what luke fords motivation is for posting something so unresearched and clearly erroneous
3454478 while i was an editor on the state desk i participated in helping direct the coverage first of the l a riots in 1993 and then the northridge earthquake in 1994 those both won staff pulitzer prizes
3454479 it seems like a stretch to say that you shared in a pulitzer when your name wasnt on any of the stories awarded
3454480 on corruption in the entertainment industry including a charity sham sponsored by the national academy of recording arts and sciences illegal detoxification programs for wealthy celebrities and a resurgence of radio payola
3454481 while i was an editor on the state desk i participated in helping direct the coverage first of the l a riots in 1993 and then the northridge earthquake in 1994 those both won staff pulitzer prizes
3454482 each year more and more consumers fall victim to various forms of this insidious crime this report puts a spotlight on california highlighting several issues that are likely responsible for driving up these numbers in the state
3454483 however california legislators and government officials law enforcement officers and non profit groups are taking aggressive steps to fight identity theft as highlighted in this report
3454484 the fact is that identity theft is a growing problem
3454485 there are a lot of people being hurt by this crime in terms of businesses and as individuals
3454486 identity theft will continue to be a problem requiring individuals businesses and government agencies to be constantly vigilant
3454487 we all need to do a better job of protecting sensitive personal information and purging data that we dont need especially information in electronic filing cabinets
3454488 taking six million hours to resolve identity theft related issues is a conservative and underestimated number
3454489 the burden of undoing the damage and restoring the victims good name takes a toll on an individuals life causing stress and anxiety
3454490 well im an rn and i know that in humans we would do blah blah blah

3454498 now thats the music i have been waiting to hear all weekend thank you
3454499 this is the first war that the united states has fought where so many of the people and resources involved arent of the military but from contractors
3454500 it was considered an all out imperative by the administration to keep troop levels low particularly in the beginning of the war and one way that was done was to shift money and manpower to contractors but that has exposed the military to greater risks from contractor waste and abuse
3454501 it is a shocking number but i still dont think it is the full cost
3454502 i dont think there have been any credible cost numbers for the iraq war there was so much money spent at the beginning of the war and nobody knows where it went
3454503 these new numbers point to the overall question when do you cross the line in terms of turning over too much of the public mission of defense to private firms
3454504 there are some things that are appropriate for private companies to do but other things that are not
3454505 but we dont seem to have had a strategy for determining which was appropriate and which wasnt we have just handed over functions to contractors in a very haphazard way
3454506 how to lose 20 lbs of fat in 30 days without exercising
3454507 i have three words to summarize my 30 years of military experience improvise improvise improvise
3454508 we try to think about the next fight so that commanders and admirals have the right forces to defend this country 10 15 years from now the enemies force us to fight a different kind of battle its a balancing act
3454509 lets say a hornet needs a part because it cant fly until it gets that part if we cant deliver the goods that plane is down
3454510 youre supposed to hold on to your harness because if you didnt your arms kind of fly away from you its almost like an amusement park ride the landings not as exciting but it comes to a very abrupt stop

3454521 the uncertain near term outlook for global financial markets and potential changes in regulatory capital requirements
3454522 our review has clearly revealed the weaknesses associated with the integrated one firm business model
3454523 some of these weaknesses such as the blurring of the true risk reward profile of individual businesses are the source of substantial risk as we have seen in the past few months
3454524 i am determined to make the management of ubs more effective
3454525 the positive sentiment seen at the end of first quarter 2008 that the credit crisis may be easing was short lived as trading conditions deteriorated significantly in the second half of may in particular for assets related to u s residential real estate as well as other structured credit positions
3454526 this occurred in the context of continuing credit market turbulence and its impact on the firms operating performance and reputation

3454549 i cant think of a better way to celebrate the 4th of july than to be here with our troops
3454550 this is one of the most rewarding aspects of being a reserve officer recruiter
3454551 to see these men and women promote up to the officer ranks is a great feeling with the 4th of july approaching we thought it would be special to conduct the commissioning aboard the midway museum hopefully this will mark a great start for each of their officer careers

3454555 wilkins was a civil rights leader in his own right seeking equality for active duty troops he was a servant to the people who at that time had hard times facing social discrimination but he worked to change that culture to ensure that everyone received an equal opportunity for advancement this was really one way to unite all people
3454556 employees come seeking assistance with issues and we assist them in the proper process and procedures in order to achieve a potential resolution to those issues then we facilitate meetings with management to give the individual an opportunity to get their part of the story told so we act as counselors at times
3454557 we talk to our constituents and ask what they think we take that information and along with the other union presidents well say this is what the people think this is what the people believe were the voice of the people and we present those views at the highest level
3454558 through big we hold training conferences in the development of primarily african americans which is the basis of how we were founded but a primary focus is education excellence within government mostly targeting african americans but we support all people
3454559 we take an eagles perspective of what a companys population looks like and determine if management reflects the workforce for example well ask a company what diversity means to them and explain how a collective perspective is gained by bringing together all nationalities to contribute to the companys success
3454560 give the kids some structure and to show them that anyone with a positive attitude who works hard can be a winner
3454561 i want to speak up for those who dont have a voice to be a servant to the people and be a lighthouse in the community
3454562 its an honor to be here and to be able to give back to the people who sacrifice so much to keep this country safe said walton
3454563 you know when everything is smooth sailing all the jumpers are going down and the ball is bouncing your way everything is easy this is the test for you now what you do in the face of adversity is what defines you thank you from the bottom of my heart for all of your contributions i cant thank you enough
3454564 its my pleasure to be here today and have the opportunity to meet these sailors said roberson
3454565 im also looking forward to having them george washington sailors come out to watch us practice later this month they will have a chance to see us do drills individually and later see us come together as a team and run plays from scrimmage
3454566 this gives us an opportunity to step bank and look at our accomplishments
3454567 we have worked extremely hard since we got here and we have a lot to be proud of you can only run steady for so long before you need a break and now is the time for that break its been a great day so far and i hope everyone enjoys the wonderful festivities in place
3454568 im having a blast said aviation ordnanceman airman james lamon
3454569 we left our families in norfolk and its difficult not knowing when were leaving san diego or when were getting home
3454570 regarding this issue the scholars took 3 opinions two which took two opposite positions and a group that took an opinion between the two
3454571 the weakest of them is if a man touches a woman he loses his wudu this contention is based on the axiom a sound suspicion of something brings about that suspicions ruling
3454572 this is the opinion of the shafi school who hold that the touching of a woman breaks ones wudu irregardless if one felt a desire for the woman or not
3454573 if one touces a woman with a barrier between him and her such as gloves his wudu is valid even if he feels a desire for her this is the opinion of the hanafis
3454574 based on two different sound readings of the verse itself
3454575 any touching of the opposite sex if not coupled with a feeling of passion does not break wudu
3454576 he went to pray thereafter and did not make wudu
3454577 dont touch them your wives while you are making itikaf in the masjid
3454578 if one were to touch a woman and he did so with no passionate feeling he is not punished meaning he did so on accident or due to a dire situation however if one was flirting or being handsy with a woman then he should be disciplined the same applies to a man who marries a woman touches her without lust and decides to divorce her that touch alone if it is free from passion does not oblige her to observe the ida according to the agreement of the scholars however there is a massive difference amongst the scholars on the payment of the mahr
3454579 there is not one narration from the companions that supports this contention
3454580 he would kiss his wife to to pray and not make wudu
3454581 because of our annual training we have built a lot of personal relationships and we get along very well
3454582 as a reserve organization we have a lot of folks who love to fly thats what brought us back to the navy reserve
3454583 firefighting missions are tremendously rewarding because you are protecting people and their property you are helping people out
3454584 we could not do what we do without san diego
3454585 and i would submit that san diego probably wouldnt be quite the same if we werent here
3454586 thank you for what you do on behalf of all of our sailors
3454587 without organizations such as yours we would not have the retention that that we do because you do a lot for us wherever we go

3454608 it was only logical to focus on transfer rna a molecule that is believed to be very ancient and is truly central to the entire protein synthesis machinery
3454609 our findings uniquely focus on structure the actual aspect of the molecule that encases its function

3454616 we developed a chip targeted at performance and then we took two of those chips and put them on one card people have tried to build bigger chips but the problem has been heat and cost its difficult for them to put two on one board because of space and power limitations

3454618 the new card looks like it will be able to deliver the goods to high end gamers a lucrative and desirable market moreover amds single card but dual gpu 4870 x2 can if early reviews are on target out perform dual card configurations from nvidia
3454619 the payoff is that this puts amd in an enviable position of having both the highest performance video card and the less expensive solution an experience they havent enjoyed for a while
3454620 el futuro es tuyo la revoluci n de las personas
3454621 im one of those people i like staying really busy so for me i think its easier because i always got something to focus on ive got my work ive got my kids ive got support from my husband that works for me
3454622 i really look at the job that i chose to do many years ago and the job that my husband has chosen to do and i think it is something special in the military it is not a perfect life we dont make huge amounts of money but were taken care of and you know what we lived overseas we have lived what text books are teaching and there are not a lot of families and kids out there that could say that
3454623 they can honestly look at their teachers and their friends and say you know my daddy is doing something to help the world or help kids in other countries or to help our own kids in the u s my kids brag they say you know my daddys a hero
3454624 there has been a great spirit of cooperation between the navy and our association
3454625 the signed mou now allows us to expand our activities honoring veterans and the active military
3454626 i am very pleased to be able to support the mount soledad memorial effort
3454627 it has been a pleasure working with the mt soledad memorial association to preserve this significant and unique memorial to u s veterans of all wars
3454628 it is important to us and we want to make sure that all this discussion is based on good solid scientific information
3454629 it is my belief that the navy is a very good steward of the environment our approach is one of balance
3454630 we recognize our obligation to the environment but we also recognize our obligation and our duty to man train and equip ships and sailors for the most stressing combat that they might have to endure
3454631 in most environments the only way we can detect these quite submarines and these very complex mines is with the use of active sonar that means we have to make sure we have proficient operators who understand how to use this active sonar and they have to train in the most realistic fashion they can possibly train
3454632 i would argue that the reason the navy concentrates in san diego is because of the training range not just for subs but for a lot of reasons it replicates many of the environments the noise level from background shipping the ocean bottom types the sound velocity profile and those kinds of things
3454633 take a balanced approach its not a single factor issue balance of stewardship and meeting training obligations
3454634 its good to be back after six months of operating half way across the world from loved ones and it is great to see our sailors and their families reunited again i applaud them for their sacrifices and making our country what it is
3454635 im so happy to have him home again few words can describe the explosive joy and excitement thats in the hearts of the spouses sons daughters fathers mothers and friends on this pier i am no exception
3454636 the crew performed superbly and vandegrift accomplished all assigned tasks i am extremely proud of every vandegrift sailor
3454637 im thrilled to be home at last to see my wife daughters and son again i missed my family much over deployment even with e mail nowadays theres still no substitute for seeing them all in person
3454638 bushes are just now starting to produce in mass quantities
3454639 hey i wonder if paul mccartney is in that old car
3454640 would not be in the best interest of the community
3454641 weve got more violence and now we dont know who to talk to about it
3454642 we are deeply concerned because it leaves the radical extremist outfits free to do what they like not merely on the pakistan afghanistan border but clearly our side of the border too
3454643 its not like theres suddenly going to be a war between the two countries
3454644 in the absence of greater trust you will see a kind of pincer movement against pakistan by afghanistan and india and pakistans establishment and state turning toward whatever tools it has at its disposal to defend itself
3454645 we made more progress in terms of peace than we have in the past 60 years
3454646 how can we get talks back on track if the prime minister the other people we meet with cant control the military the intelligence services
3454647 india did not try to draw mileage on that and get an outline for a real agreement
3454648 we missed the opportunity and we wont get another right now

3454663 clubs are trying to unsettle some of my players i dont like it its my first job in the premier league and the last thing i want to do is sell my best players

3454666 robbie is okay hes fit but he just needs to get his sharpness and ive told him that

3454678 pelosi is committed to her global warming fanaticism to the point where she has said that shes just trying to save the planet
3454679 we all know that someone did that over 2 000 years ago they saved the planet we didnt need nancy pelosi to do that
3454680 finding someone after so many years is quite rare but this gives us hope that it can happen
3454681 she did not want to tell us what had happened
3454682 she was rather icy in the meeting towards her mother and police
3454683 section 137 of the act is ignored compensation cannot be obtained and therefore a pattern of arbitrary deprivation of property ensues
3454684 no reasons are given let alone written reasons as required by the constitution
3454685 you cant be paid for doing away with an evil thing
3454686 parliament clearly intended that section 137 of the act should encourage the surrender of firearms a n aim which jasa wholly supports in our crime ridden society
3454687 if there is a successful outcome to the talks it will be a plus
3454688 but if no agreement is reached the parties must be encouraged to continue talking until a solution is found

3454758 it is important for us to be here to personally offer our support to the bargaining committee and members of local 6166 and to make sure vale understands that the entire steelworker family is 100 per cent behind our brothers and sisters in thompson
3454759 brazilian vale workers stand in solidarity with steelworkers in thompson
3454760 today we have discussed ways in which vale unions in canada and brazil might support each other in our bargaining processes at different vale operations we discussed ways in which we might support negotiations in thompson and actions brazilian unions might take to place additional pressure on vale management depending on how negotiations proceed here
3454761 when we signed the sudbury accord building global workers power in 2007 we committed to support each other in the collective bargaining process we stand by the commitment
3454762 the thompson meeting marks another milestone in the development of the steelworkers relationship with the brazilian vale unions
3454763 we again discovered that we have several issues in common with our brothers and sisters in brazil including concerns around compensation and the sharing of vales astronomical profits through profit sharing programs the environment and relationships with local communities and health and safety
3454764 we discussed how we can take practical steps despite differences in language cultural and laws to assist each other
3454765 canadian steelworkers have developed some of the best and most innovative health and safety programs in the mining industry in the world and we are looking at area as an area of joint work
3454766 it is a real pleasure for local 6166 to host steelworkers in thompson
3454767 and it has been especially interesting and valuable to learn about the strategies of brazilian trade union leaders in dealing with vale management and the way brazilian unions are building a union network inside of brazil and how they are building community support and involvement around issues of the environment and balanced economic development at some point in the future after we get the kind of collective agreement our members deserve im looking to be part of a steelworker delegation to brazil that would allow us to experience first hand how brazilian workers build workers power and deal with vale on their home turf
3454768 the world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page
3454769 we know people are probably expecting a cheese fest and thats just not what we do
3454770 the truth is jeff and i write how we write
3454771 everythings got to come out of real emotion we want to deal with issues and show consequences but not the issue of the week and pound you over the head
3454772 earlier in the summer we anticipated that she was going to appear in the show but those plans were postponed for personal reasons on ms spellings behalf
3454773 this has the glitz of an aaron spelling show but at the same time gabe and jeff have taken it and given it a sense of humor they really flip it on its ear sometimes
3454774 as long as it doesnt hit you over the head
3454775 i think its important to show what kids really use
3454776 things can take a turn and you can get a big head or get jaded
3454777 the next two weeks were going to be unveiling more and more ads and everybody that we talk to is saying get ready get ready
3454778 consider the ways the lord works in the life of the osteens as recounted in joels book your best life now which has sold four million copies and is graced by a back cover photo of the smiling couple acting through victoria who kept speaking words of faith and victory on the subject joel was led to build the family an elegant home on other occasions god intervened to save joel from a speeding ticket and to get him not only a good parking spot but the premier spot in that parking lot why god did not swoop down with a sponge and clean up the offending stain on the armrest remains a mystery because osteens deity is less the master of the universe than an obliging factotum plenty of christians have already made the point that the positive thinking of christianity light is demeaning to god and i leave them to pursue this critique more importantly from a secular point of view its dismissive of other humans and not only flight attendants if a person is speeding shouldnt he get a ticket to deter him from endangering others and if osteen gets the premier parking spot what about all the other people consigned to the remote fringes of the lot christianity at best is about a sacrificial love for others not about getting to the head of the line

3454782 we contacted hgtvs designed to sell producers and were able to get a major portion of our home re modeled at no cost because of the shows popularity we were also able to get quite a few potential buyers at our first open house
3454783 when a family receives a notice of default folks need someone they can trust to get them through the transition of selling a home under distress my job is to match them up with buyers looking for a great home at a reasonable price
3454784 it seems that in this market cash is king however deals are still getting done and loans are still being approved we just have to be realistic about our expectations in this market and be innovative in listing and buying homes for our clients

3454794 i got just a tiny bit more than that when my site was doing really well
3454795 probably be two to three years to get some oil
3454796 you know you can find oil pretty quickly you can put the engineering plans together if youve got infrastructure in place and thats why the oil industry continues to have interest in anwr cause the infrastructures there the trans atlantic pipeline is there it can bring oil quickly to the united states if anwr was opened up and you dont have to build new infrastructure
3454797 anwr would probably be two to three years to get some oil
3454798 3 to 4 years to construct the feeder pipelines to fabricate oil separation and treatment plants and transport them up from the lower 48 states to the north slope by ocean barge construct drilling pads drill to depth and complete the wells
3454799 assumes that enactment of the legislation in 2008 would result in first production from the anwr area in 10 years
3454800 the primary constraints to a rapid development of anwr oil resources are the limited weather windows for collecting seismic data and drilling wells a 3 to 4 month winter window and for ocean barging of heavy infrastructure equipment to the well site a 2 to 3 month summer window

3454802 i asked her to calm down when she came to me she was very upset she was shaking her sunglasses in my face
3454803 i asked her what could i do for you i did everything i thought i could do in that situation
3454804 i looked in her eyes and realized she was looking at the cockpit i positioned myself in front of the cockpit
3454805 i still was trying to understand what was going on because it happened so quick my main concern was i wasnt going to let this lady in the cockpit
3454806 i didnt want to lose my job because i felt i had to take a stand
3454807 i felt i was no longer going to allow people to get away with bad behavior i was very nervous about my job situation

3454846 state elections systems have shown signs of stress and theres a serious concern that they wont be able to handle the number of voters
3454847 when you get so many new registrations like that at record numbers its very difficult for people to monitor the validity of it
3454848 we dont have a real history in the last 10 to 15 years of large scale voter fraud
3454849 what we do have a problem with is getting everyone on the rolls and making sure their votes are counted
3454850 state and local parties have the primary responsibility for monitoring local voter registration and identifying problems
3454851 our view is that advance monitoring of legal developments can avoid real legal problems later on especially on election day
3454852 were all for getting people involved in the process and getting them to the polls
3454853 what were not for is registering fake people at fake addresses and creating barriers to trying to identify voter fraud where it exists which is everywhere its a growing problem because of the professional vote fraud denier industry
3454854 then as now with his national campaign for the president barack obama has always worked to inspire individuals to exercise their right to vote he sees that as a key to his victory this fall
3454855 inside its more like a military compound than the beating heart of a sporting celebration
3454856 buffoons who had a place only in the garbage of history
3454857 she is attending and there was some sort of clerical error in which somebody said she was hosting but she is not
3454858 why did she allow barack obama to quietly list her as co host of a washington fundraiser at a tony restaurant in august because she thought louisianans might not notice
3454859 senators especially those running for re election dont get listed as fundraising co hosts for presidential candidates by accident
3454860 i can assure you that it had nothing to do with a kennedy e mail about it
3454861 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3454862 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3454863 i hope well never come to the question of what we do if russia refuses to observe international law
3454864 the russian state has once again shown its face its true face
3454865 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3454866 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
3454867 i told him that i know i speak for every american when i said to him today we are all georgians
3454868 the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world
3454869 im afraid mr putin might be one of those who wants to make the trains run on time
3454870 russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory what is most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3454871 lobbied for and has a vested interest in the republic of georgia and mccain has mirrored the position advocated by the government
3454872 mr scheunemann proudly represented a small democracy that is one of our closest allies in a very dangerous region
3454873 today many are dead and georgia is in crisis yet the obama campaign has offered nothing more than cheap and petty political attacks that are echoed only by the kremlin
3454874 the reaction of the obama campaign to this crisis so at odds with our democratic allies and yet so bizarrely in sync with moscow doesnt merely raise questions about senator obamas judgment it answers them
3454875 were talking about strikes from helicopter gunships which could not have mistaken these places for anything else
3454876 if their plan to totally destroy georgian statehood fails at this stage they want to make us bleed economically
3454877 the international community has to make the russians leave georgia
3454878 theres an element of disorganisation in the military that may become a factor as the eu tries to put a blanket of calm over the situation
3454879 il vaut mieux quil pleuve un jour o il fait moche quun jour o il fait beau
3454880 uhhh hey youve got a bag tied to a piece of rope dragging from your car buddy
3454881 questions of funeral tributes or the lack thereof the disposition and location of remains and the degree of attention and care provided to a gravesite are
3454882 indicative of many factors including the prestige or esteem in which the deceased was is held by the family the community and the nation
3454883 theres one leg two legs three legs its a boy
3454884 foi repassado no final da tarde de ontem segunda feira um documento para a conmebol e estamos absolutamente tranq ilos quanto sua utiliza o
3454885 ele s fica fora devido a uma les o n o por natureza legal
3454886 estou aqui para ajudar assim como todo grupo n o importa se como titular ou reserva mas claro que meu segundo objetivo ser o titular do ipatinga
3454887 eu sei como me comportei ent o deste ponto de vista n o tenho nada do que me arrepender al m disso n o sei se todos foram absolutamente corretos comigo posso olhar diretamente para os olhos de uma pessoa sem ter qualquer dificuldade com certeza houve muitos exageros alguns desentendimentos e situa es obscuras
3454888 eu n o sabia que estava perdendo eu pensei que estivesse na frente foi a que meu t cnico come ou a gritar para que eu acertasse o advers rio
3454889 eu fiquei confuso quando vi que ele parou de lutar acho que ele ouviu algu m na arquibancada gritando corra mas n s est vamos falando para ele dar os golpes
3454890 um choque muito grande ficar assim de fora das olimp adas na v spera
3454891 a decis o surpreendeu n o apenas a n s brasileiros mas tamb m a outras delega es
3454892 ningu m esperava que o nilo fosse reprovado mas os ju zes alegaram que ele apresentou uma andadura irregular infelizmente a decis o deles definitiva
3454893 esse tipo de julgamento acontece do esporte n o acho que teve preconceito
3454894 de uma derrota como essa nasce uma grande vit ria deus sabe o que faz e eu tenho f se n o era para ser dessa vez paci ncia
3454895 n o d para ficar se lamentando o neg cio erguer a cabe a e trabalhar aproveitar a oportunidade de estar aqui para observar e aprender com os feras do esporte e melhorar daqui pra frente
3454896 vou voltar ao brasil e j p r em pr tica uma t tica para conquistar as pr ximas medalhas no pan e nas olimp adas
3454897 ele teve o problema no joelho e deu a volta por cima na copa do mundo quando ningu m acreditava nele isso que exemplo de supera o
3454898 creio muito em deus o sonho ol mpico n o acabou isso aqui apenas o come o
3454899 for the moment i believe the french initiative enjoys everyones support
3454900 could europe participate in a european peacekeeping force europe is available of course obviously we are entirely ready to consider this kind of participation if the various actors desire it
3454901 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
3454902 the old eu members have rather moderate positions towards russia while the younger ones having had experiences with russia in the past feel more strongly
3454903 our experiences with russia in the past are not so bad
3454904 but that does not mean we should not care about what is going on we will listen very carefully to all the sides
3454905 is a good basis for solving the problem getting out of the dramatic situation that has arisen
3454906 europe is available of course obviously we are entirely ready to consider this kind of participation if the various actors desire it
3454907 for the moment i believe the french initiative enjoys everyones support
3454908 if georgia is really ready to sign and moves its forces from their forward positions and to fulfil what has been agreed under these principles then the way to a gradual normalisation of the situation in south ossetia will be open
3454909 its perfectly normal that russia would want to defend the interests both of russians in russia and russophones outside russia
3454910 it is also normal for the international community to want to guarantee the integrity sovereignty and independence of georgia
3454911 la historia de europa es comparable a la historia de la humanidad la antig edad es el nacimiento la edad media ser an los a os de colegio y el renacimiento es la edad de los experimentos y las preguntas
3454912 i never thought of that thanks for pointing that out to me
3454913 well you have offended me also youre not perfect either
3454914 a community committed to providing the highest quality live concerts in a lossless downloadable format
3454915 people with good taste people who break ground people who have a sense of passion humor and righteousness for what theyre covering
3454916 the bi monthly internationally distributed glossy music magazine that gives well deserved attention to musicians largely ignored by mainstream publications
3454917 for people too old for the nme and too hip for q
3454918 es liegt im ermessen des cas ob sich die kammer damit befasst
3454919 i consider this is a good basis for solving the problem getting out of the dramatic situation that has arisen
3454920 ti ho cercata in mezzo ai volti che vedevo intorno a me
3454921 antes de que me pregunten quiero daros la noticia de que samuel etoo continuar siendo jugador del barcelona la pr xima temporada s que dije que no contaba con l pero tambi n dije que cuando comenzaran los entrenamientos la cosa pod a cambiar y as ha sido ha mostrado sacrificio en la pretemporada y hemos decidido contar con l
3454922 sheikh hasinas parole has been extended up to september 6
3454923 after the court order reaches all concerned it will be reviewed and its legal aspects will be examined and the next necessary step duly taken
3454924 there are only so many shirts and shotglasses we can buy
3454925 we have told the british high commissioner that we seriously object to holding the polls under emergency
3454926 what would you go for under a box with a stick and a string attached
3454927 we are going ahead with a plan working on specific issues
3454928 two issues are involved here one is political discussion the other is issuing an administrative order we are reviewing the nitty gritty of ground realities for making decisions in this case the time taken is logical
3454929 i dont know anything about any development on khaleda zias release
3454930 we had a meeting with the chief adviser where we discussed how to initiate the process of transfer
3454931 khaleda zias release is peoples demand by ignoring the demand some of the advisers of the government are making varied statements
3454932 we dont believe the statements of some of the talkative advisers
3454933 esse pessoal de imprensa r pido mesmo quando querem hein ok descobriram parab ns caramba at nos orkuts alheios mexeram e descobriram fotos
3454934 i forgot the keys to the lincoln and my checkbook
3454935 well i guess i made another mistake before i left i took a framing hammer and smashed every possession i had in the house i didnt want here watching my t v
3454936 her kids were always having to be taken here or there or somewhere and i just cant deal with the constant motion that gets you no where
3454937 and threes only one way i can paint and i know it drink from 6pm to midnight paint all night and crash at dawn man its hard to do that with a wife who has two kids
3454938 i kept getting commissions that i couldnt do id get 3k up front and immediately spend the money and never do the painting then id have to give the money back i lost 25k not painting in 07 a fucking nightmare norman sucks tahlequah is really the only place i can work
3454939 and then of course she went total head case everything turned into a blood feud like do you want mexican or chinese and suddenly were debating like were in the roman senate and trying to decide whether or not to invade gaul i just cant take it all i want to do is paint and drink and read books thats all i care about man
3454940 im a goddamn revolutionary anarchist and there outta be a law against you two being anywhere near each other
3454941 these are the two most bloodthirsty motherfuckers in the territory
3454942 thats jim murphy hes just a trigger pulling full blood scot and a writer an anti modernist
3454943 and that big indian hes running with is dave pony stealer a historical painter with an epic thirst for irish beer and white women you girls arent safe anywhere near these guys
3454944 ive got a domestic violence conviction so i cant even own firearms but jims an expert on that shit
3454945 you trying to tell me you aint the reincarnation of some head takin highlander motherfucker
3454946 ill need it later to tie you to your bedpost
3454947 custer is the big villian and crazy horse the big hero
3454948 yeah chooch crazy horse killed way more indians than custer ever did
3454949 oh yeah any attempt to construct a liberal analysis of american history is doomed to failure there is nothing liberal about it its like cats trying to understand dogs
3454950 its like these fucking cherokees trail of tears this and trail of tears that its so tiring and old
3454951 the indian as aggressor is too scary for the masses the cherokee nation inc doesnt want to deal with that shit
3454952 go up there and look in their offices its just a bunch of white people with cdib cards
3454953 but i do hope they accept my bid for the casino mural i could use the 40k
3454954 its a boring macho trip but im the type that fascinates
3454955 we have nothing in common and im way too old for her but we kind of hit it off
3454956 no she seemed smart enough witty completely uneducated but they all are
3454957 educations way overrated i mean do you actually talk to your women
3454958 then what does it matter if shes educated or not
3454959 good point dave i knew i could rely on you to talk me into it
3454960 go for it man shit last year i cheated on my wife with a 22 year old ou grad student
3454961 i was so drunk the whole time i cant even remember the details but my point was she was uneducated too shes getting an ma in anthropology and i had to explain to her how to use a bibliography
3454962 nothing they just take their money and push them through
3454963 i see it every day one day i was hanging out at freds studio and these college kids come in and fred starts questioning them and the boy says hes studying marketing and fred asks why and the kid says so he could add value to commodities we howled at that one fred laughed so hard he fell in the floor and rolled around i thought he was going to have a heart attack
3454964 but in case of tarique no such notice was served
3454965 if there was any allegation of income tax evasion the nbr would seek to recover that tax from him
3454966 the high court in an earlier hearing had ordered the nbr to collect tariques income tax but they took no steps to collect it
3454967 he had differences with the selectors over the selection of some players and was not happy with the situation
3454968 the only reason he has gone is because the task force felt he would be the best man to talk to the players in australia and new zealand and assure them about the situation in pakistan
3454969 it was a very hard fought series that drained a lot out of us
3454970 we showed a lot of character especially to come back after the galle test
3454971 i am very happy with the players because they played really good cricket throughout the series
3454972 we kept the standards high kept pushing ourselves and we never gave up
3454973 credit should go to the whole team i thought the difference was that we had a lot of contributions from different players throughout the series
3454974 whenever we were in a situation that we needed somebody to put their hand up do something for us they did it thats probably the most pleasing thing for me
3454975 the credit should go to the bowling unit for keeping india to a highest innings total of 329 in the whole series our guys went really hard at them and kept the pressure going
3454976 ajantha was brilliant adding a different dimension to the bowling attack
3454977 he has fitted into the dressing room well and has been very humble in all his achievements which is great to see

3455205 it appears to be consistent with the indications that witnesses or proposed witnesses had given us when the clerks office had called around to them to determine their availability and willingness to appear
3455206 i have reviewed the list with the clerk with the various responses of the proposed witnesses there are three that i can see that specifically indicated that they were not going to attend that they were told not to attend
3455207 this is a serious matter it has to do with interfering with witnesses

3455216 in germany we always said the biggest thing to win is the league title because it is a competition for the whole season so we are looking for this title and also the champions league
3455217 we have a big target to win not just one title but go for all four so we need a big squad
3455218 the last few seasons we have done very well and we were very close but we want to win these titles and this season we will try again
3455219 if you dont know whats wrong after about five or six months and you have no improvement it is difficult in your mind to motivate yourself
3455220 to walk in the gym to walk with the physio and feel a little bit of an improvement then you get the motivation and you can keep going
3455221 but if you have no improvement then thats difficult and so i was very happy after i came back in december to play and come so close to a title
3455222 the confidence among the players is as high as i have known
3455223 every player has looked back at last season and seen how close we were despite the injuries and everything that happened
3455224 it was mostly ad libbed with russell asking her for advice about hosting the show
3455225 theres also a 9 000 pound elephant in it as in the elephant in the room
3455226 its certainly given us more determination to go one step further in all competitions
3455227 we came so close in everything last year but weve got a new manager weve got some great signings who look very good who i think can strengthen the side and push us on to another level
3455228 what the hell how can u even hit a woman what kind of man r u

3455234 its hard for me to take care of myself lets put it that way
3455235 all i know is that in the past when anythings been taken away from erasmus hes always come back with a vengeance
3455236 and thats the plan he needs to come back with a vengeance wanting to establish himself as a good football player in this league
3455237 its always been a first round draft pick and trying to overcome injuries
3455238 its been pretty hard but i enjoy the patience the redskins have had and i feel like im ready to go out there and actually show what first round is
3455239 weve seen in the training room and the weight room that desire to get back healthy
3455240 he has definitely overachieved there were very hopeful thats going to carry over
3455241 it adds another very good football player into the mix
3455242 i dont want to judge erasmus too quickly weve got some other guys who have been pushing for some playing time as well so its nice to have that problem
3455243 i meet and talk to these people i am not a professional psychologist but i am sure i can help people with my own experience as an ex victim of slavery i suffered a lot of domestic violence
3455244 i was forced to work for a man my former husband who treated me like a slave so i feel i know the subject maybe even more than many others and am ready to help people with all my heart
3455245 sometimes we artists actors and musicians are able to bring more public attention to a problem than officials or politicians we speak the language of emotions and feelings
3455246 the one thing we can say with some certainty is its the tip of the iceberg

3455258 george w bush lied about 9 11 and exploited the lives of murdered americans in order to push a political agenda since the inception of the war bush and his administration share involvement in a multitude of alleged war crimes and they are responsible for unnecessary deaths overseas in addition to recklessly and clumsily pushing the united states into war bushs policies squandered our inherited surplus in order to appease the rich while neglecting to care for the needs of americans see katrina rich poor gap etc barack obama will keep us from hitting rock bottom if were not already there and help restore our credibility in the world
3455259 our nation is safer because we elected george w bush liberal allegations of impropriety in the white house amount to propaganda that has inspired paranoia and fear over non issues see fisa kucinich impeachment water boarding our efforts in iraq must continue or well have to fight the terrorists at home or worse head back to iraq to finish the job further if we do not get the job done all credibility will be lost john mccain is the only candidate with the courage and experience to get the job done
3455260 george w bush is a bum who couldnt find iraq on a map much less understand the dire financial consequences of war that are threatening to destroy our economy the war is costly and our children are indebted to china mexico and others thanks to our lack of foresight obama will make matters worse hes already advocating a larger war in afghanistan and intends to raise taxes to pay for another senseless war and increased social spending john mccain is set to continue along bushs path we may as well stay home on election day unless of course more americans take seriously the candidacy of insert favorite independent or libertarian candidate here

3455264 because i dont think theres a lot of stigma in saying youre voting for john mccain
3455265 do you want to vote for the white guy or the black guy
3455266 the real frailty of our polls is that we get very high refusal rates and we survive because the people who we interview are like the people who we dont interview on most things
3455267 and to be honest with you this is something every pollster i know is concerned about
3455268 it was clear that people were having the first opportunity to vote for an african american and there was uncertainty
3455269 you know is he going to be fair is he just going to look out for his own people and who are his own people i think weve come a great distance from that ive seen the progress
3455270 racial attitudes and stereotypes that people in many cases are not aware they have
3455271 i dont think anyone is correct or incorrect including me

3455273 i wouldnt want to be barack obama and up two points going into election day
3455274 the egg factory farmers denigrated cage free housing systems saying it was a public health menace not to raise birds in cages the unbelievable irony is that almost all of the battery cage egg producers also maintain cage free operations so if its so dangerous to produce cage free eggs i had to wonder why these very farmers would produce and market eggs in this way it seemed to be a pretty serious self inflicted wound but they didnt seem to notice
3455275 frankly im convinced that the national interest demands a new approach to our interaction with the world
3455276 like many im astonished at barack obamas meteoric rise as a candidate i have no doubt his is the leadership we need

3455316 this is precisely the solution that marketers have needed all along they now have complete online insight into customer interactions everything from a mouse move to an incomplete form rather than just page hit levels of information with an extremely simple deployment process
3455317 by instrumenting the site at the network level using standard network products to insert the dynamic collection code into each page speed trap can now gather absolutely every interaction between the user and the site or application in order to create a detailed customer focused session based record that is ideal for real time crm personalisation customer experience and business process monitoring applications in short we deliver the ultimate view of everything they did everything they saw and everything that happened to each user of the site or application
3455318 tagging in any form is vastly inferior to style of session based tracking it is not only a time consuming process but it is also impossible to say for certain which parts of the site are the best to tag subsequent changes are often difficult to make and the process is so long that its easy to slip into a situation where you have to maintain a legacy system packet sniffing is equally inefficient it provides an incomplete picture with data that is very hard to analyse with no visibility of most of the interaction using packet sniffer applications to do more than basic error detection of customer insight is only a few steps removed from trawling through server logs session based tracking really is the only reliable way to understand your customer
3455319 tagging falls down mainly from a logistical point of view it simply takes too long and costs too much to do even if the time issue can be ameliorated through tag automation you still only recover basic page level data so there is still the massive unspoken problem of how does a marketer know what additional data he wants to tag for
3455320 deciding what elements of the site are to be tagged is not so much a science as a stab in the dark and no tagging solution combats this fault if the wrong objects forms or clicks are monitored huge underlying site problems remain undetected and when bad things happen the users have to go back and tag some more to try to get the data they need in reality this means spending more time and money with the it department and then waiting for the tags to be deployed and the data to arrive with speed trap all that data is already available for instant analysis

3455333 a sabiendas de que la cifra real es mayor debido al car cter cerrado del r gimen totalitario que no permite ninguna forma de escrutinio nacional o internacional al interior del hipertrofiado sistema de prisiones y campos de reeducaci n
3455334 si bien el n mero de prisioneros pol ticos no tiende a aumentar es visible que el gobierno contin a aplicando cada vez m s ampliamente la variante de sustituir la represi n pol tica basada en largas condenas de c rcel por procedimientos de bajo perfil

3455343 weve got more violence and now we dont know who to talk to about it

3455345 its not like theres suddenly going to be a war between the two countries

3455415 ziel dieses gremiums war es das planerteam bei der fachlichen aufarbeitung von entscheidungsgrundlagen zu unterst tzen um effizient zu arbeiten wurden die fachdienststellen im zuge des planungsprozesses bei individuellen fragestellungen direkt kontaktiert

3455422 jesus said a tree is known by its fruit whats the fruit weve produced thousands are coming to praise god
3455423 todd is rather special to us weve really experienced gods presence at his meetings
3455424 im 20 years older i know lots more about the bible than he does yet theres something about him hes got something i havent got
3455425 we do our best to find out the situation in one case a boy drowned in a pool he had no pulse wasnt breathing and was clinically brain dead
3455426 we hear about the dead being raised but we dont know who they are or where they are
3455427 i saw a lot of passion from bentley but there was too much hype i just dont feel i can endorse something thats being exaggerated
3455428 because we believe in the privacy and equality of women we stand proudly for a womans right to choose consistent with roe v wade and regardless of her ability to pay we stand firmly against republican efforts to undermine that right at the same time we strongly support family planning and adoption incentives abortion should be safe legal and rare
3455429 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right the democratic party also strongly supports access to affordable family planning services and comprehensive age appropriate sex education which empower people to make informed choices and live healthy lives we also recognize that such health care and education help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions the democratic party also strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and post natal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
3455430 there are millions of evangelicals and catholics who rightly expect their own moral convictions on abortion to be included and respected in the party
3455431 the new democratic party platform takes a significant step forward in affirming women whose moral convictions lead them to make a different decision than abortion when facing this difficult choice
3455432 when the actual language of the new proposal is read it still sounds stridently pro abortion
3455433 in essence the pro life change now states that they will support a womans right to choose not to abort which really isnt very pro life either in rhetoric or substance given that the proposed change is generally so non substantive i dont think they will have any difficulty ratifying the change in denver but the change will provide them a positive opportunity to talk about softening their pro abortion position
3455434 i thought i heard a shot but people were saying they hit the glass with a hammer it didnt look like a hammer to me it looked like a gun
3455435 we are going to be evaluating whatever we receive from federal authorities or state authorities to determine whether criminal charges are appropriate

3455441 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3455442 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3455443 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3455450 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3455451 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3455452 no silly dontwant broke into the house last night and jacked off on all my shoes
3455453 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3455454 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3455455 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3455456 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3455457 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen
3455458 lin miaoke was the best in this and yang peiyis voice was the most outstanding
3455459 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3455460 this is like a voice over for a cartoon character
3455461 why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3455462 i can understand why they picked the prettier girl they need to maintain a certain aesthetic beauty during the opening ceremonies this situation is not so bad especially since it gives two people an opportunity to shine rather than just one
3455463 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation
3455464 silva doesnt want to play in england because he is happy at valencia
3455465 his family are settled and if he was to move it would only be to another spanish club like real madrid or barcelona david silva will start the new season at valencia
3455466 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3455501 our growth both externally as well as internally was massive the sheer number of new servers and their associated applications proved especially challenging as we attempted to reconcile our business expansion within the physical limits of our current infrastructure we knew virtualization was a means through which we could effectively and intelligently approach our integration challenges

3455513 keep the forums on topic and firm but fair moderation
3455514 encouraging conversation sometimes this means highlighting a potentially divisive opinionated comment and inviting response sometimes this means asking questions that everyone has an answer to and nobody minds sharing

3455521 thought leadership lead generation customer retention are top indirect revenue sources customer councils ad revenue and member dues are the most frequent direct sources
3455522 unfortunately a lot of revenue generated through business communities is indirect
3455523 from our viewpoint its really a matter of having a more engaged readership were strictly an ad business at this point and getting more people to come back to the site more often and see more pages is only good for us
3455524 clients need to appreciate indirect value of promotion brand awareness and loyalty we work with many of our clients to develop their platforms in a way that the software itself could be resold white labeled for resale

3455528 where the revenue is part of a premium service as a cost of obtaining value from the community or directly tied to the identity and ego of the community member for example some kind of payment to access premium content or tools to take better advantage of the social space identity creation is a powerful motivator to which money is a means not a barrier

3455531 i do not believe you should be doing community to generate revenue our objective is to provide customers users a way to learn share and explore technology

3455830 to have lost that amount of money and get back into the market with a similar type trade takes a lot of confidence if not arrogance
3455831 this allows me to do what i like to do i dont have to deal with investors or risk management
3455832 given the complexity of it and how big it actually is and how construction works it has had a couple of hurdles weve had to overcome
3455833 common is not good enough anymore and theyre trying to stand the social and culinary landscape of fresno on its head and provide something that hasnt existed in this city before
3455834 really this about community its about development of relationships and building something lasting that everyone can come and enjoy regardless of the times
3455835 after several tests we decided to put lin miaoke on the live picture while using yang peiyis voice
3455836 the reason for this is that we must put our countrys interests first the girl appearing on the picture must be flawless in terms of her facial expressions and the great feeling she can give to the people

3455840 this isnt the time to say i told you so

3455842 if we can beat canberra then the play offs are achievable
3455843 i have never felt anything other than what i thought was needed in terms of retaining or attaining the players we have
3455844 im not going to comment on whether brian smith has been vindicated for the changes he made last season
3455845 last year was last year and i will always want the knights to be successful but theres a right and wrong way of doing things and i think the way things were done last year was not right you cant help but put a lot of their success down to the form of kurt gidley and danny buderus
3455846 the decision to re sign kurt gidley early in the season has been the signing of the season
3455847 since chief executive steve burraston locked him up after round one or two he has improved out of sight

3455853 we agree with you that promoting universal broadband is an urgent national priority
3455854 however we are concerned that incumbent wireless carriers are seeking unnecessary and unprecedented testing delays to prevent new innovative competitors from entering the market
3455855 its not just the rights of the networks customers that would be trampled in this crazy scheme
3455856 the service provider charged with implementing this constitutionally suspect scheme would have to assemble a government mandated black list of content to be blocked thus raising the specter of unconstitutional prior restraint
3455857 sure its a great idea to provide access to the internet for those that cant afford it
3455858 computers are getting cheaper every day more families can afford one and with this new plan they wouldnt have to pay a monthly fee blocking porn isnt a big deal but it would still be a challenge for network providers to block it as website operators and surfers will surely fiind each other anyways

3455884 in retrospect this project has meant more to me than any other that ive worked on for the past 40 years the most important aspect of this work is the thought that it is providing life support that is needed on an immediate response basis to both military and civilian personnel for those who knowingly are in harms way it is particularly important
3455885 kaolin clay has been used since the 1950s as an activating agent for a clotting test that medical doctors routinely perform

3455925 weve got more violence and now we dont know who to talk to about it
3455926 we are deeply concerned because it leaves the radical extremist outfits free to do what they like not merely on the pakistan afghanistan border but clearly our side of the border too
3455927 its not like theres suddenly going to be a war between the two countries
3455928 in the absence of greater trust you will see a kind of pincer movement against pakistan by afghanistan and india and pakistans establishment and state turning toward whatever tools it has at its disposal to defend itself

3455939 i am deeply troubled by this proposed rule which gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3455940 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government this is not the type of legacy this interior department should be leaving for future generations
3455941 we have to have the ability to put our efforts where theyre needed
3455942 this really says to the agencies this law belongs to all of us
3455943 because it is not possible to link the emissions to impacts on specific listed species such as polar bears
3455944 another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3455945 i believe it is illegal and if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale

3455959 i have been approached to do many a rticles over the years and i either turn them down or accept i am at a point in life where i interview people who interest me and i like their work when the independent music network approached me about interviewing artists i told them i would if the artist appealed to me i picked jill criscuolo because i think she is going to be a big star in the near future besides having good music and being extremely talented jill is an intelligent young lady who is a joy to interview
3455960 it was fun to talk to him because he personally knew artists whom i admire
3455961 we had more of a conversation than an interview and thats the way it should be
3455962 i dont think it is going to happen even if they say yes now i dont think we have enough time to prepare for the series and complete the logistical details for the series
3455963 return of the focus back to the patient physician relationship and diminish the influence of commercial third party payors
3455964 to always have a choice about how hard or not hard one is willing to work most hospital based practices have little time flexibility
3455965 i would return the decision to care for thepatient back to the physician and not the insurance company
3455966 were and still are designed to protect obamas background from the scrutiny it deserves
3455967 there have been national enquirer headlines claiming a love child scandal involved senator john edwards or a member of his staff forcing edwards to issue a strong public denial
3455968 despite its reputation as a supermarket tabloid the national enquirer is the paper that broke the story which was confirmed of jesse jackson having an illegitimate child hence the papers exclusives cannot be dismissed out of hand
3455969 edwards contacted abc news and requested that he be interviewed about the allegations
3455970 it could well be it looks like me i dont know who that baby is i have no idea what that picture is
3455971 if everyone is miserable 85 of the time why do we even bother

3455975 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
3455976 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
3455977 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
3455978 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal
3455979 if something were half human and half animal what would our moral responsibilities be it might be immoral to kill such a creature its wrong to create creatures whose moral stature we are perplexed about

3456058 unfortunately from a republican perspective there are two different jurisdictions and two different economies and two different realities on the island
3456059 the major question historians will ask is not why the republicans surrendered but why they fought such a futile long war
3456060 it has not been unconditional surrender and it has been infinitely better than continuing to fight a futile war for the sake of honouring irelands dead yet producing only more of them but let us not labour under any illusions that the conditions were good
3456061 party leader david ford claimed today that the dup and sinn fein do not want the minister to be a member of the executive meaning he or she would have no role in wider issues like the budget
3456062 so called breakthrough over the department of justice amounts to very little
3456063 apparently all the dup and sinn fein have proposed is a minister who would not even be a member of the executive
3456064 how could anyone fulfil a role as important as justice minister in those circumstances
3456065 should be a runaway winner an eye for detail humour and history i want to be him
3456066 depth variety and regular posts and a bit of politics too
3456067 a brilliant mix of humour politics and insightful analysis not just of ni but of british left politics and beyond where else do you get postings in what i assume is serbo croat beside gail walker watch and the photos attaching to the stories are usually hilarious although a disappointing absence of girls aloud as naughty schoolgirls of late
3456068 for its unusual socialist outlook on northern ireland and wider politics his is the perspective of someone who feels not unreasonably that the present party political system leaves his left wing views unrepresented as such he stands aside from the traditional ni partisan discussions a refreshing interesting and nicely written blog
3456069 is written with a certain amount of linquistic flair this is a blogger who clearly enjoys his english he also enjoys reading and gives us book reviews and cultural pieces his political position is self described as liberal unionist but his views are not entirely predictable and the items rather eclectic including a fascination with and dislike for ethnic nationalism in its east european manifestations
3456070 chekov really has a penchant for writing in a way that really grasps the reader
3456071 i hate to say it but chekov does write well
3456072 passionate unionism epitomising the pan uk unionist approach oneill synthesises an incredible amount of material for this blog a blogger with a genuine grasp of his subject
3456073 for the fact that he is in public office and combines council business and interesting outlooks generally
3456074 but only since pol omuiri came on board since then it has moved beyond a party political platform to something more considered and interesting
3456075 a group blog fairly closely associated with an identifiable political party is quite a good thing as it provides a picture of that partys id as well as a space for them to develop their thinking about issues that they will sometimes have to answer for their stance on soonish
3456076 a wee part of the blogosphere where i can be found and i shamelessly do so because it will permit me to state that the blog in question has been nominated four times in political blog categories and lost four times
3456077 i agree with its tone and attitude regarding the north of ireland situation
3456078 ignited has a grasp of the nuts and bolts of politics which i envy reading his pieces always make me view my own stuff as a bit conceptual and airy fairy a blog which is in touch with the unionist grass roots
3456079 fair deal is one of the very few bloggers delivering a dup standpoint in a thoughtful manner i rarely agree with what he says but hes always worth reading damian oloan is an excellent new addition writing coherent and temperate analysis from a liberal nationalist perspective an encouraging indication that moderation is not dead
3456080 fair deal damian oloan tom griffin patrick corrigan and very occasionally ian parsley all are delivering thoughtful and coherent articles analysing different areas of political life here
3456081 almost intimidating erudition from brian crowe as he examines the world from communitarian conservative perspective
3456082 where language literature and politics intersect some thoughtful musings on identity in relation to northern ireland from an irish ex pat
3456083 a tyrone ex pats whimsical blog where politics is viewed through the filters of sport travel identity and more recently fiction
3456084 a new collaborative venture by a number of bloggers braodly on the left it deals in political social and cultural issues as well as some humour
3456085 possibly the most impressive blog there are serious and thoughtful pieces virtually every day on a huge range of topics
3456086 serving up an interesting mix of investigative journalism and local interest
3456087 david vance really out posts the other contributors and hes from the north though id say that his focus is a good deal wider but his stuff on ni is quite astute
3456088 everyone is in a panic but trying not to show this we are afraid if one person shows it everyone will we are trying to calm down
3456089 we felt that we couldnt afford that people lose confidence in the banks
3456090 i remember the smell of gunfire the smell of war in the air it was very painful to see the loss of territory people falling into poverty
3456091 i tell them to be calm but stay vigilant and if the time comes leave
3456092 we know what it is like to be part of the soviet union and we are a people who love freedom
3456093 through words and deeds we have tremendously damaged relations with our neighbors we have made mistakes we have to act more prudently
3456094 dont bother that is not your home any more just go
3456095 we dont know what to do if i go back i dont have a house i dont have cows nothing
3456096 they all put the blame on russia a lot of people are not supporting the government but they are united in one idea that we have to fight for our freedom and independence
3456097 no one was out of their houses no one was sitting on their front lawns
3456098 the numbers of casualties we could have had would be tremendous
3456099 i told him that i know i speak for every american when i said to him today we are all georgians
3456100 the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world
3456101 this would be good news but this is of course not enough
3456102 the issue is closed there is no discussion about georgias claim over south ossetia we are not going to see them any more there
3456103 we received all solidarity from the alliance for my country and i have the feeling there was full understanding of the deep and difficult situation
3456104 thats why we ask nato to reconsider the new circumstances and the new situation in terms of security in this area
3456105 the community cant place their full confidence in that kind of inquiry
3456106 this new plan september 2014 aligns our schedule to what we forecast will be the available resources
3456107 we are slowing down the work to match and stay under our available funding and to do that we had to go to a later date
3456108 we are adhering to our commitment date of march 2015 for initial operating capability
3456109 our confidence that the gap will get no worse than five years has actually improved
3456110 while there are still opportunities for improvement the panels finding concluded that nasa is making significant progress in improving safety issues during the past year
3456111 we are not just blindly cutting out redundancy or robustness in this design process
3456112 i could not be more pleased with the progress we are making
3456113 would not be in the best interest of the community
3456114 i tried to hit it in the middle of the green and came over it just a touch
3456115 he was obviously very good on the back nine and things just happened his way
3456116 the only thing i can do is go home with my head up high and keep working on it
3456117 some days it wont go for you and you have to be prepared to handle that
3456118 but you got to be also prepared to take those shots on and take that responsibility and the consequences that go with it whether you take it or not
3456119 oh just go you have to because youll need some information youll find there
3456120 our argument is unless you give tamils a feeling they have the right to their own destiny in many matters you will not succeed the lttes capacity to carry out terrorist attacks is not diminished
3456121 the sri lankan army has made a lot of progress in the last few weeks
3456122 but even if they win the battle i am not sure they will win the war
3456123 i think they havent got the tamil population on their side i know the sri lankan government will be unhappy at this advice but that is the best advice they could get

3456158 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3456159 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3456160 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3456161 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3456162 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3456163 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3456164 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3456285 nor will they tolerate unregulated fares going up by more than this at a time when high fuel prices mean that more people are travelling by train

3456413 shoes that claim to encourage and even contribute to weight loss but require nothing more than walking are all the rage and while some of those claims are valid some are not
3456414 its a classic case of something that sounds too good to be true actually being too good to be true
3456415 its important to realize these shoes force the foot to actually function differently

3456418 feet work harder with all flip flops just to keep them on increasing the occurrence of tendonitis and other injuries
3456419 also an open toe in any situation often leads to injuries especially when theyre worn for outdoor chores or while rushing through crowds
3456420 if you overwear them they will cause tendonitis there are no two ways about it
3456421 similar to custom arch supports the user undergoes an adjustment period where they gradually increase the amount of time they wear mbts beginning with half an hour per day that undermines the appeal of a weight loss program that requires no additional effort on the users part

3456423 they are good for people doing chores around the house since their function is comparable to a slipper
3456424 there is no shortcut to achieving a healthy lifestyle no matter what route a person chooses its going to take some work
3456425 many of the shoes at the heart of this trend actually do offer some benefits but when used incorrectly the wearer can wind up with more problems than she started out with

3456439 we expect unity staff to share the same values and code of conduct as council colleagues and so are very concerned about these allegations

3456495 as day follows night we can be pretty reasonably reassured that there will be a recovery
3456496 whats really going to have to happen is a full cleanup of all the bad assets out there
3456497 consumers arent going to be able to use their homes as cash machines anymore
3456498 this new plan september 2014 aligns our schedule to what we forecast will be the available resources
3456499 we are slowing down the work to match and stay under our available funding and to do that we had to go to a later date
3456500 we are adhering to our commitment date of march 2015 for initial operating capability
3456501 our confidence that the gap will get no worse than five years has actually improved
3456502 while there are still opportunities for improvement the panels finding concluded that nasa is making significant progress in improving safety issues during the past year
3456503 we are not just blindly cutting out redundancy or robustness in this design process
3456504 i could not be more pleased with the progress we are making
3456505 the question is not if hydrogen powered vehicles will be available commercially but when
3456506 these cars here will be the first generation the second and third generations will be needed before we move to products with hundreds of thousand or millions are made a year
3456507 so it will probably take no less than eight years and no more than 12 years before you get to that level that we have seen with the prius hybrid
3456508 i think evans real strength is you get someone on the ticket who has a record of being strong on national security and that is a very important quality to have
3456509 everyone assumes that every calculator they use will produce an accurate result but in reality there are vast inconsistencies between the calculations being done
3456510 to make certain the esa isnt abused to make global warming policies
3456511 epa ignored its statutory mandate to promulgate cair consistent with provisions in title i of the clean air act mandating compliance deadlines in downwind states
3456512 theoretically sources in alabama could purchase enough nox and so2 allowances to cover all their current emissions resulting in no change in alabamas contribution to davidson county north carolinas non attainment
3456513 in michigan we never passed on the lawfulness of the nox sip calls trading program
3456514 epas approach regionwide caps with no state specific quantitative contribution determinations or emissions requirements is fundamentally flawed
3456515 epa cant just pick a cost for a region and deem significant any emissions that sources can eliminate more cheaply
3456516 epas interpretation cannot extend so far as to make one states significant contribution depend on another states cost of eliminating emissions
3456517 one question were you the co author with ken grimes of the article gay marriage is natural http www huffingtonpost com paul j zak gay marriage is natural b 112256 html thank you jos solano
3456518 yes we are writing a book on oxytocins effects and that op ed came from it best paul j zak phd director center for neuroeconomics studies http www neuroeconomicstudies org
3456519 must somehow be beneficial to women or it would have been eliminated from the gene pool
3456520 and nearly each partner in these animal marriages engage in extra pair mating
3456521 it turns out that both marriage and homosexuality are in fact both common for our species
3456522 human attachment behaviors depend on the same bonding molecule called oxytocin also found in other mammals
3456523 it is not surprising that we see long term same sex partners
3456524 long term attachment between genders and within a gender should be viewed as natural as the care and affection we quite easily show to those around us
3456525 allows us to have morality a love beyond the self that far exceeds anything found in our mammal relatives
3456526 the attorney generals office changed the language to say that proposition 8 seeks to eliminate the right of same sex couples to marry
3456527 eliminate the right of same sex couples to reshape the legal term of marriage
3456528 he was trying to explain that obama was hurting his relationship with black voters by recently conducting moral lectures at african american churches
3456529 but whether this is the appropriate ballot measure well have to wait until it goes on
3456530 i support the extension of benefits and i supported the extension of protections from discrimination for same sex couples and ill continue to do that but i dont support changing the definition of of marriage
3456531 we know that the state supreme court came out and said that marriage is an open institution according to the constitution its unfortunate that the mayor feels that he knows better
3456532 im often out of sync with other political leaders in the bay area
3456533 i have to do what i think is right what is right for my community thats what i do
3456534 thomas colbys fine paper on the federal marriage amendment and originalism
3456535 were not saying diablo 3 is the end of the diablo universe but we are trying to bring this storyline to a close
3456536 we also tried to focus a little more on bringing characters back and not just from diablo 2 but from diablo 1 people can expect to see characters from diablo 1 more characters from diablo 2 and characters from some of the books
3456537 encompassing all pollutants that are subject to regulation under the act whether or not they are independently subject to naaqs federal air quality standards or other general limits
3456538 seen as a significant national model that other states strive to replicate
3456539 cair will result in the largest pollution reductions and health benefits of any air rule in more than a decade the action we are taking will require all 28 states to be good neighbors helping states downwind by controlling airborne emissions at their source

3456555 why not arent you giving marriage licenses to same gender couples
3456556 yes thousands but we havent had any siblings thats incest
3456557 not gay then why do you want to get married
3456558 for the financial benefits of course and we do love each other besides we dont have any other prospects
3456559 but were issuing marriage licenses to gay and lesbian couples whove been denied equal protection under the law if you are not gay you can get married to a woman
3456560 wait a minute a gay man has the same right to marry a woman as i have but just because im straight doesnt mean i want to marry a woman i want to marry jim
3456561 and i want to marry tim are you going to discriminate against us just because we are not gay
3456562 i suppose you wont need the change of name form then
3456563 thats right you see were all bisexual i love jane and robert jane loves me and june june loves robert and jane and robert loves june and me all of us getting married together is the only way that we can express our sexual preferences in a marital relationship
3456564 but weve only been granting licenses to gay and lesbian couples
3456565 no its just that well the traditional idea of marriage is that its just for couples
3456566 well i mean you have to draw the line somewhere
3456567 who says theres no logical reason to limit marriage to couples the more the better besides we demand our rights the mayor says the constitution guarantees equal protection under the law give us a marriage license
3456568 well my psychiatrist says i have a dual personality so i want to marry the two together maybe i can file a joint income tax return
3456569 at best it doesnt move voters and at worst for republicans it moves them against them

3456585 sex in the nude including oral and anal sex right out in the open
3456586 i think its open to interpretation and thats the great thing
3456587 you know if i want to protest something because it offends me thats my right as an american and its also any artists right to say and do whatever they wanna do
3456588 when i heard about it i felt really hurt inside
3456589 i cannot believe a writer could write something like that its the not the way that we want to be portrayed we have feelings we dont like the word retard we are people
3456590 there were parts of the movie where i laughed but it seems to me that the movie tried really hard to go too far and then pull back on everything that was offensive except the issue of people with intellectual disabilities i just think ben stiller and the people involved in this movie just didnt think it was going to be offensive
3456591 no changes or cuts to the film will be made

3456593 this population struggles too much with the basics to have to struggle against hollywood were sending a message that this hate speech is no longer acceptable

3456596 this number is an important reminder for physicians and patients that antibiotics can have serious side effects and should only be taken when necessary
3456597 for conditions in which antibiotics have questionable benefit such as many mild upper respiratory tract infections weighing the benefits of antibiotics with the risks of a serious adverse event will be especially important
3456598 because antibiotics are frequently used both appropriately and inappropriately if doctors would reduce the number of antibiotics they prescribe to their patients by even a small percentage we could significantly reduce the number of emergency visits for antibiotic adverse events physicians need to communicate to their patients that antibiotics are not harmless

3456608 to attempt to interpret this statute as including those in the category of the plaintiff would be to engage in a judicial enlargement of the clear statutory language beyond the limit of our judicial function we have traditionally and consistently declined to trespass on legislative territory in deference to the time tested wisdom of the separation of powers as expressed in art 30 of the declaration of rights of the constitution of massachusetts even when it appeared that a highly desirable and just result might thus be achieved
3456609 because guideposts for responsible decisionmaking in this unchartered area are scarce and open ended by extending constitutional protection to an asserted right or liberty interest we to a great extent place the matter outside the arena of public debate and legislative action
3456610 where did they get their understanding of marriage and what will it mean in the future
3456611 our rule is you can play around because you know you have to be practical
3456612 i think men view sex very differently than women men are pigs they know that each other are pigs so they can operate accordingly it doesnt mean anything

3456666 i suppose he could have joined the reserves and used the money he made from the army for college but brad didnt think that was the right way to do it he thought he should enlist

3456668 apollo was very good to me when my son was killed
3456669 weve got more violence and now we dont know who to talk to about it
3456670 we are deeply concerned because it leaves the radical extremist outfits free to do what they like not merely on the pakistan afghanistan border but clearly our side of the border too
3456671 its not like theres suddenly going to be a war between the two countries
3456672 in the absence of greater trust you will see a kind of pincer movement against pakistan by afghanistan and india and pakistans establishment and state turning toward whatever tools it has at its disposal to defend itself
3456673 we made more progress in terms of peace than we have in the past 60 years
3456674 how can we get talks back on track if the prime minister the other people we meet with cant control the military the intelligence services

3456676 for me youre a little bit frozen in time a little bit alison poole the 21 year old party girl in that book who runs around new york going to nightclubs doing drugs and abusing credit cards
3456677 thats definitely a theme in my life seeker of truth
3456678 i was around him a lot it was great we went to africa the whole experience was life altering for me
3456679 byron was a no 1 pick the seventh overall in the draft
3456680 hes started in the league won games in the league were happy to have him here to kind of bail us out
3456681 its been the same injury time and time again but i never got it fixed because i wasnt a doctor and nobody told me hey you need to get that fixed
3456682 once i got it fixed its better now last year i got something different a high ankle sprain on the other ankle
3456683 your quarterbacks throwing motion is his throwing motion and thats not going to change a whole lot
3456684 everyone knows byrons got a little of an elongated motion and hes going to have to make it up with smarts and anticipation
3456685 i feel as though im a little slower with my windup so i just throw the ball faster and it gets there at the same time
3456686 i was impressed simply by the fact hes a quick study
3456687 he was able to step out there step in the huddle spew the verbiage out get people lined up actually and deliver the ball around hes a very sharp guy thats obvious i would guess hell be able to play on thursday
3456688 i just want to play football and help the team as much as i can
3456689 thats my mind set just go out there become a better player help this football team see what happens
3456690 its different because youre not the guy and you used to be the guy
3456691 we all know who the guy is my job is to prepare myself every day in case im needed and if im needed i have to go out there and we cant miss a beat and thats what im going to work myself toward
3456692 all the guys they were we play nine innings in here
3456693 i was just going up there trying to put the ball in the air
3456694 that is why the people are happy that u s forces are doing this
3456695 they have asked for our assistance and we have been able to provide it
3456696 and the reason we are able to provide it is because we have this great cooperation with the afghan army the police our british allies and of course our troops are out here doing a fantastic job as well
3456697 we have worked with the u s before at the ali khail school when i first got here in may
3456698 enjoying working together once again supporting each other and the afghan national security forces to make things a bit safer
3456699 and they are doing the real hard work of making sure that anyone who gets into the clinic to be seen incidentally by afghan doctors is secure
3456700 we allow them to take care of their people we provide the medications and advice on prescribing and then dispersing them
3456701 and now we are happy that the u s forces will build a clinic in the village for us and they are already starting to work on it
3456702 and when we need to talk about the issues if we give them a call they invite us
3456703 sometimes we invite them because we think they are from our own village they are part of our own people
3456704 o ur time our energy should be spent in educating agitating organizing our fellow citizens in the workplace in the neighborhood in the schools our objective should be to build painstakingly patiently but energetically a movement that when it reaches a certain critical mass would shake whoever is in the white house in congress into changing national policy on matters of war and social justice
3456705 true religion will not let us fall asleep in the comfort of our freedom love thy neighbor is not a piece of advice its a command god my friends is with the poor and god is with us if we are with them this is not a burden this is an adventure
3456706 but i just couldnt bring myself to pull the lever and vote for you
3456707 because i dont think theres a lot of stigma in saying youre voting for john mccain
3456708 do you want to vote for the white guy or the black guy
3456709 the real frailty of our polls is that we get very high refusal rates and we survive because the people who we interview are like the people who we dont interview on most things
3456710 and to be honest with you this is something every pollster i know is concerned about
3456711 it was clear that people were having the first opportunity to vote for an african american and there was uncertainty
3456712 you know is he going to be fair is he just going to look out for his own people and who are his own people i think weve come a great distance from that ive seen the progress
3456713 racial attitudes and stereotypes that people in many cases are not aware they have
3456714 i dont think anyone is correct or incorrect including me
3456715 to get to the heart of that youd have to do the kinds of research that havent been done
3456716 i wouldnt want to be barack obama and up two points going into election day
3456717 we live in a republic of the illusion of choice success requires intelligence drive and resources the illusion of choice ensures an orderly transfer of power
3456718 why would i be proud to be a seasoned tourist
3456719 our buyers are almost all from china russia the gulf thailand india and the european union and we can barely keep up with their demand
3456720 this legislation sends a strong signal to burmas military regime that the united states stands firmly on the side of my countrys democracy movement
3456721 i asked her to calm down when she came to me she was very upset she was shaking her sunglasses in my face
3456722 i asked her what could i do for you i did everything i thought i could do in that situation
3456723 i looked in her eyes and realized she was looking at the cockpit i positioned myself in front of the cockpit
3456724 i still was trying to understand what was going on because it happened so quick my main concern was i wasnt going to let this lady in the cockpit
3456725 i didnt want to lose my job because i felt i had to take a stand
3456726 i felt i was no longer going to allow people to get away with bad behavior i was very nervous about my job situation
3456727 what i get irritated about is they have tournaments on mothers or fathers day
3456728 i may sound crazy saying im doing this so my son can play high school ball and then college ball and maybe move on from there but were devoted to our kids
3456729 not only are kids getting into it earlier but theres a huge market with pitching hitting speed and agility lessons and everybodys swinging a worth prodigy lithium bat that costs 200
3456730 in the last 10 years or so we have seen a noticeable difference in the number of younger kids 8 and 9 years old playing travel ball

3456757 as a concerned citizen for the city of boise it is very unfair that at idaho iceworld the hockey director and the figure skater director on city time can be allowed to do classes in which they make personal gain and cause the rest of the city works to be backed up for just their benefit of personal gain during city hours i would like somebody to please look into this thank you very much
3456758 but i just couldnt bring myself to pull the lever and vote for you
3456759 because i dont think theres a lot of stigma in saying youre voting for john mccain
3456760 do you want to vote for the white guy or the black guy
3456761 the real frailty of our polls is that we get very high refusal rates and we survive because the people who we interview are like the people who we dont interview on most things
3456762 and to be honest with you this is something every pollster i know is concerned about
3456763 it was clear that people were having the first opportunity to vote for an african american and there was uncertainty
3456764 you know is he going to be fair is he just going to look out for his own people and who are his own people i think weve come a great distance from that ive seen the progress
3456765 racial attitudes and stereotypes that people in many cases are not aware they have
3456766 i dont think anyone is correct or incorrect including me
3456767 to get to the heart of that youd have to do the kinds of research that havent been done
3456768 i wouldnt want to be barack obama and up two points going into election day
3456769 i have no doubt that his is the leadership we need and that the world is crying out for
3456770 its difficult to walk away from your partys nominee but you have to put your country first
3456771 there are a lot of democrats and independent voters who are going to vote for we know that for a fact america is desperate for leadership

3456780 from the previews i expected daniel baldwin to have actually committed the rape murder
3456781 average daily rate growth is going to slow though it wont be cut drastically and thats where the buyer can come in and negotiate
3456782 its going to be more competitive so there may be more bargaining power on the corporate side
3456783 hotels have been doing extremely well but when there are more offerings hotels have to start negotiating rates and going after markets that they didnt before
3456784 given the deterioration of the dollar against the euro america is pretty much on sale
3456785 san francisco used to rely on the technology industry and when there was the crash hotel business suffered in new york finance advertising media and tourism all are big components so its a market that does not suffer as much when there is a recession it turns around much faster than any others
3456786 construction costs are on the rise and financing rates are much higher and thats if you are lucky to get it
3456787 some of these planned hotels will find the financing to make the project happen but some will not so we may have less supply then whats originally indicated
3456788 were talking about occupancy decreasing thats at very high levels
3456789 it probably will bottom out at about 80 percent which is still very strong
3456790 thats whats beautiful about it were not trying to make this a 2008 building it really is a 1929s building except with new amenities

3456794 they have pressure to get here and have pressure to get through the games
3456795 has canada ever done well during the summer olympics theyre a winter powerhouse though
3456796 it kind of goes without saying this is a pretty big day for us
3456797 there are four beautiful little daughters all eating cake playing with each other and its very surreal its hard to believe this is the life i somehow wandered into
3456798 the university of calgary faculty of environmental design donated a table they made especially designed to feed the four babies each of the girls has their own spot and theyre actually finger feeding themselves now
3456799 we started with toenail polish and then we got brave and we let that wear off
3456800 its always been colours autumn was autumn colours red yellow brown orange brooke is water colours so blue or green and calissa is pink and dahlia is purple
3456801 autumn is just a smiley happy little girl brooke is the most laid back calissa is absolutely the busiest of the girls if theres trouble shes causing it or on her way to it dahlia is very independent
3456802 we dont want to raise our kids as a collective quad
3456803 simon is amazing in himself he is so sweet and gentle hes their favourite person definitely their favourite person
3456804 i do remember very clearly when they pulled out autumn and youre so worried and you dont know whats going to happen and they pulled her out and she let out this great big cry and i just remember thinking shes going to be ok shes crying shes crying
3456805 and then brooke calissa and dahlia and then i was out and i was always worried they were going to pull out a fifth

3456812 the voters deserve the chance to have their voices heard on key issues in the campaign with or without the senior senators participation
3456813 we will extend an invitation to senator johnson to participate in one or all of the events however if his campaign staff wont agree to debates then its our duty to offer voters the chance to talk about the issues that are critical to south dakota and the future of america
3456814 i dont think this is about senator johnsons speaking ability but because he doesnt want to publicly defend his voting record he has continually voted against domestic oil drilling he has voted to allow illegal immigrants to receive social security and continues to toe the line for the liberal party leadership and their agenda in washington
3456815 i believe the voters will respond positively to this chance to participate in the campaign discussion south dakota has an opportunity to choose a new direction and a new voice for real change
3456816 rear admiral jose americo bubo na tchuto managed to elude his guards flee and seek refuge in nearby gambia on sunday august 10th
3456817 he fled alone and should not pose a threat to the public of guinea bissau
3456818 absolutely ron george should be thrown out for voting for gay marriage
3456819 he has a very radical view of whats a family
3456820 i really felt that as chief justice i had to have the broad shoulders because i knew there would be substantial controversy about it
3456821 there has to be a compelling governmental interest to justify treating people equally situated in a different manner
3456822 most people thought his legacy would be the modernization of the courts
3456823 i think the gay marriage decision will now be his principal legacy
3456824 it isnt anything that i have given any thought to i will do what i should do when that time comes about
3456825 the shit he did thats what got me into heavy music vulgar display of power i was only into eighties music before that the heaviest thing i listened to was skinny puppy and ministry but that wasnt metal when i heard vulgar display i was like holy shit what the fuck is this the first time i ever saw them live before korn was even signed me and fieldy korn bassist went and it was pantera and sepultura at irving meadows in l a they came out started the first song the curtain dropped and me and fieldy just started crying we looked at each other and we had tears in our eyes because it was so fucking intense and heavy and sick
3456826 the first pantera song i heard probably would have been
3456827 i cant think of a more relaxing way to spend a sunday than with friends and fashion

3456829 it just filled up so fast the water was just pouring through the windows i just did whatever i could i had no sandbags nothing i tried to stuff stuff in the windows but the water was just too strong it pushed out all the windows
3456830 my house is destroyed i dont know what else to tell you i dont know
3456831 many of these families had less than a few minutes to get out to safety so they really just grabbed and ran they probably didnt have what they needed
3456832 the red cross hopes to be out with our emergency response vehicle bringing clean up kits to the residents doing house to house damage assessment meeting with them to make sure their needs are met and theyre safe and ok
3456833 you could tell they just never thought it would happen to them but thats the nature of disaster it strikes anyone anytime anywhere
3456834 its a little quirky to masturbate to pictures of your mother
3456835 there may be some last minute injuries there might be some nancy kerrigan tonya harding thing coming your way you never know maybe ill reject the award on behalf of someone ill think of something controversial its better to burn out than fade away right
3456836 what you see in the trailer had to be a little bit squished around so it could get on tv i think in the final film youll see its true to the graphic novel hes naked
3456837 i was a camp counselor for first grade boys at a jewish day camp i did it for a few weeks and then i just left i left these kids high and dry with only a week to go they were all on ritalin and traded garbage pail kid stickers that was their thing thats all that they did they would get in fights with each other and i would just let them have it out
3456838 no i dont speak the secret language of women women are a mystery to me thats why i keep writing about them and thats why im amazed at their devotion to me
3456839 we will work around the clock to catch those responsible
3456840 we have a very experienced team of detectives working on this case we have the support of the local community the area command policing and the people of newcastle to catch whoever is responsible for this horrendous crime

3456859 the desire to rule is the mother of all heresy
3456860 from milk toast internationalist to brave mccain like warrior in under 24 hours
3456861 every so often we get this sort of ufo photograph and i use the acronym
3456862 i saw a very bright light in the horizon the light began to get closer i saw it wasnt a plane as it lacked the corresponding lights thats when i summoned my neighbor the light got even closer and we recorded it with his video camera
3456863 it floated in the air in a circular fashion its center was illuminated my neighbor told me and i took out the camcorder we felt that it was something out of the ordinary it looked like a nut seed
3456864 the available information leads us to suppose that a foreign body violently crashed against the site
3456865 the only way to determine if a heavenly body actually collided would be to find its remains which will require new expeditions to the location outfitted with proper equipment
3456866 hello again ana luisa im jose antonio who took the santa cecilia video thanks for your willingness to analyze the video i received a message from the event organizer clarifying the matter it was in fact a balloon that was crafted for the event it couldnt be any clearer and i feel more tranquil now
3456867 the object was recorded toward the end of the event on july 10 2008
3456868 we had no idea that we were in the cosmic center of the universe and suddenly they chose us
3456869 as mayor im disappointed to learn that the signs were not alien in origin
3456870 in fact we thought it was a prank by someone in the township
3456871 weve dealt with the matter with certain merriment and good cheer
3456872 there is a legend that causes outsiders to gather in montserrat once a month to see the ufos that appear
3456873 and we hope that the crop circle making aliens come back next year
3456874 the greatest proof of the existence of extraterrestrial life is that it has not wanted to contact us
3456875 its a tubular hole between the trachea and the pectoral very deep and it was through there as thought a huge hand with powerful claws had gone inside the horses heart was removed
3456876 whats odd is that if an animal had been involved it would have bitten it or caused external damage the only injury it has is internal
3456877 an extraplanetary force interferes in human affairs and with human minds thwarting natural evolution since the beginning of time
3456878 an intelligence that needs a certain mental activity and a support vehicle body that isnt necessarily a dense physical structure these intelligent creatures have taken advantage of our need to believe in something greater than ourselves and our belief in a spiritual level in order to usurp its functions if we manage to understand their goals it may be possible to avoid being manipulated by them
3456879 the ufo laughs at all of this as we would laugh if we could see the desperate two dimensional figures on the surface of a piece of paper the ufo heals the sick creates messiahs brings messages of peace removes the contents of skulls sneers at supersonic aircraft and carries in its belly an entire zoo of beings ranging from apolloesque hyperborean angels dreamed up by a devotee of aryan philosophies to the elemental chimeras of childrens tales and hagiographical accounts involving small demons with horns and even spiked tails technology how absurd
3456880 alternate mechanisms to the eth in the realm of the paranormal
3456881 some of the many creatures that inhabit the universe are native to the physical dimensions we are familiar with
3456882 the incisions were irregular but not serrated they were similar to the ones detected a few years ago in this area furthermore there wasnt a single drop of blood at the site
3456883 its tongue had been ripped out and the bone was exposed this isnt an easy thing to achieve
3456884 the incisions observed have nothing to do with any mouse or predator
3456885 i am advising you of the mutilations that occurred in rosario del tala approximately between july 12 13
3456886 i visited the site on tuesday the 15th and on the 16th it was possible to reconnoiter the property
3456887 the desire to rule is the mother of all heresy
3456888 to pass a strong resolution getting the russians to show some restraint
3456889 you do what you want but if you do this then these are the likely results and if you do that then those are the consequences
3456890 if you want to be our friend then do this and dont do that
3456891 kids arent going out at night out of fear of the strange creature and the ufo
3456892 it hasnt been seen again it would be good for it to return to ascertain that the events were indeed as described
3456893 a disk shaped metallic object that projected white purple and orange light from its mid section as it moved from south to north in perfect silence despite it size which the couple compared to that of a soccer pitch
3456894 classic flying saucer like something out a movie from the 1950s
3456895 it gave off lights like streamers of red and green
3456896 i have no doubt that it is a mothership in other words an extraterrestrial device of gigantic proportions capable of transporting lesser units and which have been repeatedly seen in different parts of the planet for years
3456897 just happened to be at the right place at the right time
3456898 bringing together the mechanisms for a joint struggle and a better exchange of both equipment and armaments
3456899 without being pejorative our air force is not developed it isnt the type of air force able to make interceptions as do other air forces the priorities of the persons in charge do not extend to ufos i think perhaps there is an arrangement between governments so that every time a strange object falls in our mexico another country can take it away to engage in research on it
3456900 what is more i believe that they are extraterrestrial spacecraft
3456901 yes i have seen one at a farm i own in the province of zaragoza at s daba i witnessed a shining object there it hung motionless in the sky and at an altitude which was hard to determine since i was unable to determine its size i summoned my relatives and all the farmhands and they all saw it i recall that all of s daba saw it it lasted for over an hour
3456902 well so what should i do throw him out of spain
3456903 still blow over huemul one can play the tourist and visit the facilities which sheltered the axis scientists and their mysterious work but we cannot even cast a glance at the classified papers of richter or his collaborators beck haffke ehrenberg seelman eggebert greinel abele and pinardi
3456904 a sincere dialogue between civilian and military personnel aimed at dusting off the cases filed in some government office
3456905 it was noon and i was flying with captain danilo catal n we were both flight instructors
3456906 it was large and must have been some 15 to 20 miles away it moved in the same direction as us we had no missiles guns or anything as you can imagine the fright was more or less considerable we could see a large thing surrounded in smoke and from which a vapor issued all of this situation must have lasted some five minutes we approached the ufo but it was motionless it neither approached nor retreated it merely sailed parallel to us it was quite impressive because it was truly something strange and something could be seen in concealment behind the smoke
3456907 the sky cleared and the lines on the radar vanished
3456908 however there had been an object physically flying there its not a yarn let me tell you its my only experience with ufos
3456909 the chilean air force has repeatedly stated to the point of exhaustion that there are no ufo files
3456910 there are no ufo investigations taking place anywhere in the world because we cannot investigate something we cannot identify for this reason we research claims the events narrated by the eyewitnesses
3456911 we are latin americas first official and public commission on the subject
3456912 and we have advised others such as chiles comision de estudios de fenomenos aereos anomalos cefaa in 1998
3456913 and the sad part is that it is keeping all of us from a having a real discussion on things that matter
3456914 as a black man in america i can never deny that race matters but i believe race is the red herring in this campaign folks have gone too far and are too sensitive
3456915 we should all agree that race is a part of this campaign once we acknowledge the elephant in the room perhaps we can start to figure out how to draw the line
3456916 im thirsty can you point me to the soda pop aisle
3456917 people want choices people want the opportunity to make their own decisions
3456918 they come in and they look and they go were overwhelmed
3456919 since reagan the ideology in the united states has been that choice is good and more choice is better and to the extent that you can give people more choice in every area of life you are improving their well being
3456920 nobody has the time or the expertise to make informed choices about everything
3456921 when options are presented people have a tough time just ignoring them
3456922 its wonderful that we can sit down in our living room and order 20 000 things in a superficial way we are more informed than people used to be but its hard to get our attention and i dont see any way of turning that around
3456923 the era of choice the ability to choose and its transformation of contemporary life
3456924 follow me unless you have something more interesting going on
3456925 the only way were going to solve our problems in this country is if all of us come together
3456926 we are fellow americans and that shared distinction means more to me than any other association
3456927 theres no way were going back to the times of zachary taylor
3456928 with more choices out there if leaders want to bring issues to the attention of the public they have to bring it into our venues and speak it on our terms
3456929 institutions are breaking down and there are going to be new ways of doing things but the cream can still rise the signal can still make it through the noise in this new environment
3456930 you dont need 90 percent of the public informed on the issue and following it closely to get your policy passed
3456931 not everybody was running around yelling yeah yeah liberty death
3456932 this country is an experiment and for it to have endured for this long it requires the involvement of citizens citizens making choices
3456933 where are those conversations we had like patrick henry on the steps
3456934 propensity to vote is in part based on enthusiasm but its more typically assessed using voting history and intention among other factors
3456935 when youre talking about campaign funds they cant be used for personal use you cant use campaign funds to buy yachts or go out to barbados
3456936 friends can give gifts to people up to a certain limit beyond that its income to the recipient
3456937 whether its an in kind contribution if they were paying her for something that was not campaign work probably not
3456938 in countless public fora the bush administration has pledged its committment to georgias territorial integrity that committment has always been followed by the hope that all potential conflicts would be resolved peacefully administration officials insist that in private conversations at the highest levels they have told the georgians that their committment did not include military intervention on georgias behalf and say they have repeatedly urged the georgians not to provoke the russian bear but this stance gives rise to a question at natos most recent summit the administration pushed very hard to grant georgia a place on the initial rung of the ladder toward nato membership european governments blocked that attempt but u s remains committed to getting georgia into the atlantic alliance the definition of nato membership of course is a mutual defense committment an attack on one equals an attack on all are we ready to go into battle against russia to defend georgia in nato

3456953 clinton ran on the basis of managerial competence on her capacity as she liked to put it to do the job from day one
3456954 in fact she never behaved like a chief executive and her own staff proved to be her achilles heel
3456955 the right knows obama is unelectable except perhaps against attila the hun
3456956 roots to basic american values and culture that are at best limited
3456957 this has been a very instructive call talking to myself
3456958 this circular firing squad that is occurring is unattractive unprofessional unconscionable and unacceptable it must stop
3456959 believed to keep sinking all the way down to the bottom cutting deep crevasses and vertical tunnels that scientists call moulins
3456960 when the water reaches the bottom of the ice it lubricates the surface of the bedrock and destabilizes the ice mass
3456961 large pieces of ice to slide quickly into the ocean
3456962 could lead to a far more rapid disintegration of the ice sheets than predicted by any current models
3456963 present ice velocity measurements from the major ablation area along the western margin of the ice sheet
3456964 ice velocity reacts to increased meltwater production and increases by a factor of 4
3456965 over a longer period of 17 years annual ice velocities have decreased slightly
3456966 in earlier work lemke et al 2007 zwally et al 2002 it has been suggested that the interaction between meltwater production and ice velocity provides a positive feedback leading to a more rapid and stronger response of the ice sheet to climate warming than hitherto assumed
3456967 the englacial hydraulic system adjusts constantly to the variable meltwater input which results in a more or less constant ice flux over the years
3456968 may have only a limited effect on the response of the ice sheet to climate warming over the next decades
3456969 republicans are moving to examine surges in voter registrations in some states a republican lawyers group held a national training session on election law over the weekend that included campaign attorneys for sen john mccain and other republican leaders one session discussed how party operatives can identify and respond to instances of voter fraud
3456970 republicans said they are particularly worried about prospects for fraud in virginia and pennsylvania and are beginning to comb thousands of new registrations in those states for ineligible applicants in some cases the huge numbers threaten to swamp their efforts and those of state and local governments to verify and process applications election officials in virginia and other states say there is no evidence of widespread fraud so far numerous studies have found fraud and other voting irregularities in past elections to be infrequent and generally not prevalent enough to influence the outcomes of most contests some republican lawyers say that despite the huge numbers of new registrations in some areas this years problems could be fewer compared to prior years because of improved procedures and tougher rules
3456971 regardless of how the voters got on the rolls johnson said the sheer number of democrats is a concern this year as is the fact that more hispanics are now registered democrats about 455 000 hispanics are now in the democratic party which only this year surpassed republicans who count 425 000 in their ranks compared to the last presidential election the numbers are even more dramatic for african americans more than 207 000 have joined the democratic party since 2004 accounting for 44 percent of the new voter growth
3456972 the boom that turned swamps and pastures into a suburban mecca has stopped dead now the talk is about plummeting home values rising food costs and gas prices that make the once painless half hour commute to tampa a financial strain its enough to give some here the sense that maybe this time around the republicans do not deserve their votes
3456973 even as younger voters are showing signs of breaking with years of lackluster turnout to support him obama is facing singular resistance from voters over 65 that age group turns out at the highest rate on election day and is disproportionately represented in the swing states of florida and pennsylvania bill clinton and al gore both relied on it in winning the democrats only popular vote majorities of the past two decades
3456974 with polls showing obama dominating among those under 40 and running even among middle aged voters republican john mccains lead among those 65 and older is the main reason he remains close overall his margin is largest among older white voters without a college education accounting for much of obamas problem with the white working class
3456975 by this time in 2004 president bushs re election campaign had spent 13 5 million on television in florida the president went on to win the state in november sen obamas ads have touched every media market in florida which is the most expensive for advertising among the closely fought states
3456976 how the gop is moving to examine these surges in the voting rolls
3456977 they can buy a locomotive anyplace in the world they can buy it anyplace in the world but they buy it here because its the most fuel efficient and its the most environmentally sound and it requires the least maintenance
3456978 i want you and every american to tell the congress that when we start anew in january of 2009 lets sit down together republican and democrat libertarian vegetarian whoever it is lets sit down together and start working on these problems together and put our country first
3456979 now if youd just raise your hand we have some people with a microphone or if youd like to go back to work whichever
3456980 where did the internet come from besides al gore and by the way i have great respect for vice president gore
3456981 eighty four percent of the american people think that the countrys on the wrong track congress has a 9 percent approval rating now you get down to 9 percent youre down to paid staffers and blood relatives you cant get much lower than that
3456982 um call tom ridge to washington from whatever vacation he is taking and get him to work
3456983 who will be the next president of the united states
3456984 the most productive and most competitive worker in the world resides in the united states of america
3456985 drilling offshore isnt the answer either but its a bridge its an important bridge to exploit our own oil and natural gas reserves while were making this transition that we must make to energy independence
3456986 i liked what he had to say today i want to hear more of what hes going to do to solve our issues
3456987 its a very important thing to do in life vote for someone thats going to run your future
3456988 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
3456989 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
3456990 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
3456991 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
3456992 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
3456993 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
3456994 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
3456995 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
3456996 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
3456997 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
3456998 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
3456999 its better that the us do the drilling than china or cuba it will be a lot safer
3457000 he has a voting record to the left of vermont sen bernie sanders and sanders is a socialist
3457001 for me the issue is israel with obama you get louis farrakhan and rev jeremiah wright coming in the back door to the white house
3457002 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
3457003 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
3457004 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
3457005 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
3457006 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
3457007 before there was the internet and at the time i was at the justice department leading the prosecutions we could say with a fair amount of certainty that the number of people involved in child pornography in america was small and getting smaller
3457008 they then begin to trade child pornography with traders on the internet people who have collections however someone who has an extensive collection is not willing to give you that collection unless you can provide original material to that person
3457009 how do you get original material you begin to molest your neighbors kids maybe your own kids and your relatives
3457010 a great slideshows is determined by the type of interaction a presenter has with their slides
3457011 if the presenter is addicted to reading bullet points then everyone in the room suffers
3457012 we can keep blaming software for the putrid output but in reality we need to take responsibility
3457013 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure
3457014 we need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast
3457015 americas three great national challenges our economy national security and climate change can all be addressed by switching to renewable energy
3457016 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together choosing the right path and repowering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
3457017 we all know our country faces tough challenges a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
3457018 we can switch to smarter cleaner forms of power and take advantage of free energy sources like the wind and sun the answer is simple power our country with 100 percent clean electricity within ten years
3457019 we are taking this message to a national audience because this goal is both ambitious and attainable
3457020 meeting the challenge to repower america will deliver the affordability stability and confidence our economy needs as well as a healthy environment and it will generate millions of good american jobs that cant be outsourced
3457021 there are good muslims and bad muslims that i have to admit just like there are good and bad jews
3457022 no this was their place first they could take the hot weather and some of them went far in this world theyre not lazy
3457023 i know hes smart i dont think hes a dummy like bush
3457024 im fine i have to go for blood work again they keep me waiting for an hour im all sunburned like a berry i get in the water and i forget to get out i get in conversations
3457025 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3457026 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3457027 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3457028 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3457029 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3457030 just so you all know we did set a record
3457031 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3457032 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3457033 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3457034 these battleground states are good reflections of the nation as a whole
3457035 the youth vote both religious and non religious are likely to show the same patterns at the national level if they religious youth can have an impact nationally they will have an impact in the battleground states
3457036 the abandoning of politics as usual an opportunity for the underrepresented to have a voice
3457037 obama is the face of the christian youth generation moreso than anybody else
3457038 a vast majority of my friends believe mccain is the face of the christian youth vote today
3457039 upholds the christian values and he acknowledges that god should be kept in public places
3457040 young religious voters are looking for a president who will keep our nation safe while expanding economic opportunity and promoting our common values in this election young religious voters will see that john mccain has the leadership values and vision we need in our next president
3457041 our campaign is reaching out to young people of all faiths including evangelicals by holding house parties hosting events with key supporters and even holding rock concerts faith has been an important part of senator obamas life and he shares the commitment that millions of young evangelicals and people of all faith have to changing the world around them
3457042 a lot of people who will vote for mccain because of his view on israel and a lot of people will vote for obama because of his view of change and his objectivity to tackle foreign policy issues
3457043 because of the nature of the contest this time around both parties having highly contesting races
3457044 in touch with issues that matter to young people and he views them as beneficiaries to todays policies
3457045 what i am when i hear him is inspired and i dont get that from other politicians
3457046 mccain has a stronger allegiance and better stance on israel
3457047 there is more to electing the next president of the united states than being a good speaker
3457048 turnout is critical and the only votes that count are the votes that are cast
3457049 my experience as a missionary teacher in africa opened my eyes to this simple fact without access to energy life is brutal and short
3457050 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
3457051 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
3457052 this will be a very interesting experiment that can never happen again
3457053 it is all just mist does anybody think that china would ever consider cooking the books on aug 10 ap measured 604 micrograms m 3 the bbc measured 278 in another location and beijings air quality index which is supposed to be the highest of many different readings measured 82
3457054 it doesnt matter if global warming is true or not we all want cleaner air
3457055 our actions over the coming few decades could create risks of major disruption to economic and social activity later in this century and in the next on a scale similar to those associated with the great wars and the economic depression of the first half of the 20th century
3457056 once they are gone youll go back to sucking down the equivalent of a cigarette drag every time you breathe outdoors
3457057 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
3457058 we thought our climb was over but couldnt go down our ascent route
3457059 alpinism is not just death tragedy survival and heroism we hope our climb will serve as a reminder that mountaineers like us and many others climb mountains to live to enjoy to grow and to accept the verdicts of life and sometimes also of fate without arguing or lacking respect toward those who share the same value the value of life
3457060 this year a passing will be impossible for a small boat as you can see on the ice situation map end of july 2008
3457061 arctic ice has diminished but theres more ice in antarctica now truth is about 2 3rd of total north pole ice always melts by the end of the northern summer this summer it got down to about 1 4 of the winter amount it is much less alarming if you consider that the total between the 2 poles only represents about a 5 reduction from normal
3457062 this was such a road these were such gold splashed peaks
3457063 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
3457064 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
3457065 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
3457066 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
3457067 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
3457068 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
3457069 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
3457070 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
3457071 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
3457072 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3457073 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
3457074 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
3457075 i thought i would share a photo of my golden retriever rusty who is easily the coolest dog in 20011
3457076 id love to have breakfast with you just the three of us without cameras and lights and tell you why i feel so strongly about this
3457077 utopians in the american vein who both believed in power but bridges wanted to see it redistributed abram wanted to see it concentrated
3457078 and say thus saith the lord god behold i am against thee o gog the chief prince of meshech and tubal
3457079 sheba and dedan and the merchants of tarshish with all the young lions thereof shall say unto thee art thou come to take a spoil hast thou gathered thy company to take a prey to carry away silver and gold to take away cattle and goods to take a great spoil
3457080 this is not the russia of 93 or 94 a terribly weakened russia
3457081 the russians are now negotiating from a position of strength
3457082 weve been working on georgia for four years and weve failed everyones guilty but putin is playing his cards brilliantly he knows exactly what hes doing and the consequences are all negative
3457083 this was a proxy war not about south ossetia but about moscow drawing a red line for the west
3457084 they marched into georgia to challenge the west and the west was powerless were dealing with a new russia
3457085 russian soldiers have been in south ossetia and abkhazia for 15 years the outcome of the negotiations will probably be the entrenchment of the russian presence in both of the enclaves
3457086 what can have an impact on the russians without damaging us more than them
3457087 this is the first time ever that an american presidents request was rejected because france and germany stuck together
3457088 might have been viewed as a green light by russia for its attacks on georgia i urge the nato allies to revisit the decision
3457089 a country that has such problems and is led by a hot headed militant does not belong in nato
3457090 it could take the whole alliance hostage and start the third world war
3457091 the spectrum of views in the eu is very wide it ranges from cold warriors to appeasers
3457092 could ralph naders entrance and exit have helped al gore the impact of decoy dynamics on consumer choice
3457093 we found that the entrance and exit of a third option the nader effect can profoundly impact consumers preference
3457094 the presence of the third alternative shifts the focus of the customer if you have two automobiles extolling their fuel efficiency while a third promotes style purchasers pay more attention to the fuel efficiency criterion then when one of the high fuel efficiency cars leaves the market the other fuel efficient car draws consumers in the case of automobiles it might be fuel efficiency and in the case of political candidates it might be health care when the third choice exits the remaining candidate with the most similar attributes becomes the favorite even if they werent before
3457095 we also call this effect the phantom decoy effect because like pre announced software that is never released these desirable options that become unavailable may never actually exist
3457096 the increase in affinity that a product may receive when a decoy option real or not is removed can mark a significant change in consumer choice
3457097 in terms of elections even a 5 percent increase in preference makes a huge difference at the ballot box
3457098 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3457099 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3457100 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3457101 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3457102 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3457103 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3457104 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3457105 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3457106 doesnt look like all those presidents on the dollar bills
3457107 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
3457108 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
3457109 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3457110 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3457111 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3457112 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3457113 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3457114 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3457115 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3457116 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3457117 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3457118 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3457119 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3457120 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3457121 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3457122 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3457123 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3457124 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3457125 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
3457126 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
3457127 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
3457128 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
3457129 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
3457130 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
3457131 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
3457132 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
3457133 i have a recommendation but its not of a person and i shared this with them back in march
3457134 wait till the democrat convention is over and see who they pick youll have more information
3457135 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
3457136 this government is simply not going to throw in the towel when the health and safety of our communities and the lives of our young people are at risk
3457137 we remain committed to the goals of making our communities safer protecting our youth from a life of drugs and crime and showing compassion for those who fall victim to illicit drugs
3457138 i am proud to be part of a government that is working to reduce the damaging effects of illicit drugs on our youth and on our communities
3457139 our collaboration with the provinces territories and support agencies help provide youth the support they need to make smart choices and steer clear of illicit drugs and drug related crime
3457140 we cannot build safer communities without addressing the needs of young people with addiction issues
3457141 this initiative is part of a broader provincial strategy to treat youth with substance abuse problems by treating addiction we believe we can reduce reoffending and stop the progress of youth offenders into the adult justice system we appreciate the federal governments continued support as we work together to reduce youth addiction and crime
3457142 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
3457143 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
3457144 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
3457145 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
3457146 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
3457147 if black people kill black people every day why not have a week and kill white people
3457148 are you better off now than you were four years ago
3457149 im having a belvedere in your honour the mountains are fantastic fabulous colours in the high desert will say hi at pasquals for you
3457150 i know there is a little mini panic going on in the ranks of not a few democrats and the chattering classes but with o in hawaii the nation on vacation the tv full of the olympics phelps romping in the pool and georgia on my mind i just want to say hey its august chill
3457151 the unreal is the paris britney obama glam rock nonsense the latest example of which is
3457152 the more team mccain does this as much as it obviously gets their ya yas out the more they demean their candidate
3457153 this country faces immense issues and it is not a time for insipid parodies and you know what the american people understand it and they want more from the men who are asking for their vote to be president of the united states so the mccain frat boys can act out as much as they want
3457154 the unreal is thinking that obama has peaked in the high 40s in virtually all the polls but not understanding that it is mccain who may have peaked in the low 40s where he has been stuck in virtually all the polls
3457155 what is real is race the industrial states and commander in chief
3457156 this election brings us into new territory the country has never gone through this before
3457157 you ask americans where georgia is and they think it is somewhere near atlanta
3457158 so the handwringers are wailing that we are only slightly up in august but guess what we are up in august and we will still peak in late october
3457159 hey you got sms in australia we want to text you on the vp the moment barack makes his decision as we told our troops
3457160 thanks for giving me an excuse to sip the belvedere love taos and santa fe chill baby
3457161 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3457162 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3457163 historically presidential nominations were decided at the party conventions and as a result the vice presidential running mates were also selected at the conventions gallups jeff jones notes
3457164 that made it difficult to disentangle the effect of naming a vice presidential running mate on a candidates support from the
3457165 the small window of time after the announcement of a presidential candidates running mate but before the convention has taken place
3457166 similar to the pattern seen with clinton in 1996 support for gore held steady during bushs vice presidential selection phase at 41 percent
3457167 we always knew the region was unstable and we will just have to wait and see what happens
3457168 your task o roman is to rule and bring to men the arts of government to impose upon them the arts of peace to spare those who submit to subdue the arrogant
3457169 we must indeed all hang together or most assuredly we shall all hang separately
3457170 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
3457171 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
3457172 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
3457173 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
3457174 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
3457175 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
3457176 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
3457177 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
3457178 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
3457179 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
3457180 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
3457181 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
3457182 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
3457183 one can live in the shadow of an idea without grasping it

3457185 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3457186 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3457187 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3457188 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3457189 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3457190 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3457191 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3457192 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3457193 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3457194 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
3457195 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
3457196 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3457197 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3457198 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3457199 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3457200 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3457201 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3457202 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3457203 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3457204 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3457205 cutting extreme poverty around the world in half by 2015
3457206 so the key to the upcoming election is whether white voters will be more less or equally likely to vote for obama as for kerry i believe the answer is less likely
3457207 just as the american revolution inspired mahatma gandhi to free a great people
3457208 even if you dont like both candidates you should vote for someone because if you dont then you have no business complaining for the next 4 years you did not allow your voice to be heard
3457209 does a governorship have more credibility than congressman or senator
3457210 the average age of elected presidents since 1952 the era of televised politics is 56
3457211 mccain is scare mongering and creating fear in americans just as weve seen republicans do in the last 8 years fear seems to work which is why they are doing it again get scared of the black guy etc etc very old politics of mcbush mcsame
3457212 what i think it boils down to is are the democrats just as motivated for obama in 08 as they were with an
3457213 please tell me a mccain policy that is not in line with bush
3457214 treason fled before us for resistance was in vain while we were marching through georgia
3457215 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3457216 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3457217 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3457218 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3457219 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3457220 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3457221 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3457222 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3457223 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3457224 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3457225 is about to make one of the most important decisions of this campaign choosing a running mate
3457226 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3457227 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3457228 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3457229 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3457230 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3457231 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3457232 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3457233 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3457234 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3457235 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3457236 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states

3457268 i was not sure i wanted to order it unless it covered the tax aspects although am still mulling it over
3457269 etfs avoid irksome capital gain distributions through the clever use of exchanges in kind trades of mutual fund shares for securities in the fund with arbitrageurs because these trades are not taxable events etfs are typically able to rebalance their portfolios without realizing capital gains in effect etf shareholders are taxed as if the etf is just another security they pay taxes on dividends distributed by the fund but they are only hit with capital gain taxes when they sell their etf shares

3457273 darwin was fascinated by questions of hair colour and the role it might play in choosing sexual partners he was keen to test whether english blondes really were more likely to stay single with a resulting decrease in blonde hair in subsequent generations
3457274 there are nine sets of calculations in which darwin and his son george who was about to take up a fellowship at cambridge combined and reanalysed the data
3457275 your apology for troubling me in this matter really made me feel ashamed i think there can be but few of us humbler cultivators of natural science who would not feel it an honour to be permitted to contribute his stone towards the building of your great edifice
3457276 sadly so far none of darwins letters to beddoe have been found there are no fewer than nine sets of calculations in which darwin and his son george who was just about to take up a fellowship in cambridge combined and reanalysed the data
3457277 eventually darwin came to the conclusion that the experimental basis was not good enough both beddoe and darwin came to the conclusion that the original results were misleading and didnt make sufficient allowance for the darkening of hair with age
3457278 he had hundreds of correspondents from all over the world as well as manuscripts seed samples plants and even dung these letters give us an insight into darwin the scientist and also darwin the man and his family life
3457279 we have had to apply a lot of detective work into these letters as few of them are actually dated while some of the words he uses do not mean the same as they do now and there are a lot of abbreviations that read a bit like modern text messages

3457293 there was a couple of things we were trying on the new speedo suits and they are quite difficult to get on in fact they can take about 20 minutes and i think melanies was a bit tight to get on
3457294 i think melanies did split a little bit i think there was a bit of a panic on there and a rush to get round before the race and i just dont think she had them the goggles on tight enough thats all
3457295 what happens if you look at usas michael phelps he has a new suit every time he races theyre obviously better when they are brand new they are not stretched or anything last night thats the idea behind them

3457364 the school does take a very stern view of infractions especially in offences which cause hurt to another however do please bear in mind that the offenders are still very young in age and will need a lot of time and patience to change whatever disciplinary actions we take we do this with careful thought ensuring that the actions are fair and appropriate for the age of the child for example we are very reluctant to cane publicly any child especially if they are from the lower primary level because of the trauma it can cause that child this and the fact that a naughty child often repeats an offence can sometimes cause parents to have the perception that not enough is being done to stop the perpetrators

3457371 we dont have leaders in our country but we have managers our aim is to produce visionary leaders in future who can bring back hope and amalgamate our people there is a huge appetite for such leadership and we hope to be the source
3457372 we are not operating in any way which may counter israeli interests we have turned down many requests involving arms sales to georgia and the ones which have been approves have been duly scrutinized so far we have placed no limitations on the sale of protective measures
3457373 they contacted defense industry officials and arms dealers and told them that georgia had relatively large budgets and could be interested in purchasing israeli weapons
3457374 his door was always open to the israelis who came and offered his country arms systems made in israel
3457375 compared to countries in eastern europe the deals in this country were conducted fast mainly due to the defense ministers personal involvement
3457376 it was clear that too many unmistakable israeli systems in the possesion of the georgian army would be like a red cloth in the face of a raging bull as far as russia is concerned
3457377 and that the interception of three of these rpvs in the past three months was an expression of this anger not everyone in israel understood the sensitive nerve israel touched when it supplied such an advanced arms system to a country whose relations with russia are highly tense
3457378 we conducted a small job for them several years ago
3457379 the israeli is the main investor in the georgian economy everyone is there directly or indirectly
3457380 the israelis should be proud of themselves for the israeli training and education received by the georgian soldiers
3457381 we are now in a fight against the great russia
3457382 and our hope is to receive assistance from the white house because georgia cannot survive on its own
3457383 its important that the entire world understands that what is happening in georgia now will affect the entire world order its not just georgias business but the entire worlds business
3457384 we need help from the un and from our friends headed by the united states and israel today georgia is in danger tomorrow all the democratic countries in the region and in the entire world will be in danger too

3457401 ive been here for 16 years and president for a little over two years and as you can see from the numbers weve had a tremendous turnaround which is great for the organization a large part of that is due to our raffle which has proven to be an effective source of fund raising and a tool for raising awareness as well
3457402 its been extremely helpful to the health of the organization

3457506 game physics is essential in enabling deeper interactivity and real world effects in any game epic is pleased to offer physx as a standard feature within unreal engine 3 to enable such effects
3457507 the introduction of gpu acceleration for physx promises both additional potential effects and faster performance you can get a glimpse of the possibilities of what physx is able to do with the special levels for unreal tournament 3 where damage effects greatly enhance the gameplay
3457508 the use of physics in games is highly effective in enabling new levels of interactivity and gameplay options gearbox is excited about these developments and we are rapidly finding new ways to use nvidia physx to improve the games immersive feel and overall excitement factor
3457509 the addition of gpu acceleration allows us to add even more effects whilst maintaining great performance gearbox titles including borderlands and others will feature increased use of physx and we look forward to developing more with the support of nvidia
3457510 seeing really is believing and is the reason why we compiled all of this great physx content into a free download for our end users
3457511 we want geforce owners to experience for themselves these amazing effects to get an idea how physx will make games much more lifelike in the years to come physics accelerated content is already here and there are a ton more titles on the way we cant wait for our customers to jump in get wet and tell us what they think
3457512 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3457513 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3457514 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3457518 the cost to use the olympic wifi service is 3 500 chinese yuan or about 515 at current exchange rates thats 30 a day about 10 times what the service cost for the 2006 olympics in torino but you pretty much have to pay it because its the only system available and you cant buy it on a per day basis
3457519 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3457520 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3457521 the board felt that billie had the necessary capabilities coupled with a strong connection to the various public and private sectors throughout the state to achieve our goals

3457523 theres a very serious attempt on the part of episcopal clergy in the diocese of forth worth to petition rome for some kind of recognition

3457525 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3457526 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3457527 our goal was to work hard and keep our pressure
3457528 the main thing was to keep some consistency overall i was very pleased
3457529 we achieved our goal we tried to minimize the gap
3457530 playing the us was inspirational for us they are the best
3457531 they played very hard start to finish you have to respect a team that is going all out to the end
3457532 our main thing is to get better thats what we want to do every day
3457533 we havent shot the ball well from the outside as a team since weve been here but im sure we will
3457534 if we start hitting threes we will be a lot better we havent really gotten hot yet and it hasnt affected the intensity of our defense that says a lot about our guys
3457535 our opponent is the strongest team in the world we tried our best
3457536 im sure the whole continent was watching when you play the us everybody is going to be watching you have to do something
3457537 losing by 20 to the usa is not bad at all they were great
3457538 we understand the nba is loved in the whole world
3457539 we are being watched on how we look and what we do we take that with a lot of pride
3457540 it was incredible watching the play where lebron james dunked the ball with his left hand after doing some air movements
3457541 im going to play very aggressively defensively be a leader and offensively attack and make plays for others
3457542 we didnt want to delay the process to a point where there would be no value left and we decided liquidation was the best option the last few stores closed at the end of july
3457543 there was a pattern in some bankruptcy courts of granting extensions for as long as the debtor wanted and that had to be stopped
3457544 liquidity is sucked out of the debtor in a way that it becomes hard to survive
3457545 rapidly rising health care costs are not simply a federal budget problem
3457546 growth in health related spending is the primary driver of the fiscal challenges facing state and local governments as well unsustainable growth in health care spending also threatens to erode the ability of employers to provide coverage to their workers and undercuts their ability to compete in a global marketplace
3457547 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3457548 het is langzamerhand uitgegroeid tot een doelwit waarin men zich meer en meer is gaan interesseren
3457549 er zijn een hoop meer mensen die zich ermee bezighouden en ook daadwerkelijk hun handen vuil maken
3457550 ik heb een hoop reverse engineering op het apple platform gezien
3457551 windows ontwikkelaars kunnen hun bestaande code pakken en deze eenvoudig laten werken op het apple platform
3457552 mogelijk nemen ze dan echter ook bestaande kwetsbaarheden in de code mee naar het apple platform of ze cre ren nieuwe omdat ze op een compleet ander platform werken
3457553 het toont dat mensen bekwaam worden in het analyseren van apple software
3457554 er kijken mensen naar de iphone we geven kwetsbaarheden door aan de ontwikkelaars van de software en zodra we contact hebben met apple vragen ze ons of we de kwetsbaarheden ook al op de iphone hebben uitgetest ze willen niet voor verrassingen komen te staan

3457563 iphones success raised the bar of consumer expectations regarding mobile multimedia
3457564 handset manufacturers worldwide are in the midst of revamping their product lines against this new benchmark
3457565 until consumers are presented with a clear cut simple and inexpensive value model for accessing mobile video and tv content it will be hard to segment audiences at either an industry or geographic level

3457576 strength and energy from yoga new age and cosmic energies
3457577 to love and be loved is the most beautiful thhing that can happen to a person and ones own life is much more important than all the glamour and fame in the world
3457578 with humour even when its sometimes difficult to do you can never allow yourself to lose your sense of humour life goes on and its just too wonderful to be spent singing the blues
3457579 aside from that whoever said life is going to be a cakewalk life can be incredibly hard laughs so people you better buy yourself a safety helmet
3457580 oh dear lord no certainly not im pretty doggone sure that rachel with her usually very chaotic love life would definitely not be the ideal person to take advice from
3457581 naturally courteney and i have been accompanying one another through life for quite some time now i trust her completely and she is very good at giving advice shes a good girlfriend shes got a really great family
3457582 naturally its a beautiful thing to have a family there are many things that are worthwhile i can only say that i look at the future with a great deal of optimism i will continue making movies and i hope to be able to make a few dreams come true
3457583 but much better than spending days making plans is to go out and create concrete opportunities
3457584 just feel free to say that im turning 40 next year
3457585 how about lust for life otherwise i do the best i can to keep myself fit both in body and mind i also draw a lot of strength and energy from yoga new age and cosmic energies i very much believe in karma the way you treat your fellow man is how youll ultimately be treated yourself
3457586 oh yeah that old story i once had the degree of my deviated septum operated on since then i can breathe much better and sleep nights like a baby the rest of my body is all mine and absolutely natural and its going to stay that way i am absolutely satisfied with what god gave me
3457587 boy the way that sounds as if im crazy its true that i spent some time regularly taking part in sessions with a psychiatrist an absolutely fantastic woman who unfortunately died not too long ago by the way i find it to be very normal to lie on a couch every once in a while and let your head be straightened out and your hear but please dont write jennifer aniston is crazy promise lets go back to talking about the movie
3457588 it sure would be all that bad if a man when he came home and opened the door ran to his woman with his tail wagging and smooched her up this wholehearted excitement is something ive always missed in men to be quite honest
3457589 youre asking me well yes i do have some advice men and women should communicate more honestly with one another we really are very different thats why itd be important that we listen to one another sounds very simple but quite complicated in real life
3457590 i believe that wouldnt be a very good idea friends was a wonderful time in my life and is now like so many other things a chapter thats been closed lets keep looking forward
3457591 that id abuse a romantic attachment as a publicity stunt or to promote a new movie of mine thats really just way below the belt
3457592 now hiring a coked up whore to promote bottled water yeah id totally do that
3457593 its something we would all like to be using a lot more but its really just starting
3457594 i felt like maybe i could talk to both sides
3457595 certainly in a museum youd like to be on the forefront of new activity and computer imaging would be at the forefront of what to do
3457596 now i come along as a copyist i cant do the original in one motion because im not van gogh
3457597 so i strike the brush multiple times to mimic the art
3457598 i guess the easiest way to think about it is youre a detective at a murder scene you got to collect a lot of evidence but you dont really know which piece of evidence is the one that cracks it open for you
3457599 thats the job so to speak of the conservators of the museum
3457600 were trying to understand the kind of creative process that the artist engaged in
3457601 were in the early days of what im expecting to be an important area for researchers

3457609 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3457610 half of all business income in the united states now ends up going through the individual tax code
3457611 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3457612 the people ive spoken with their views of the crop are certainly dramatically different than what these yields today say and what the conditions say theyre much more cautious and much more conservative
3457613 its important to note that most of that unexpected production gain was offset by higher demand and the fact usda pegged ethanol demand at 4 1 billion bushels this year infers to me there will be at least 4 5 billion bushels for the 2009 10 campaign
3457614 the american people deserve more access to american oil and congress should be in session until we vote
3457615 call to a democratic member of congress from your state
3457616 in a year when the playing field is stacked enormously in favor of the democrats and obama this is an issue that seems to help republicans and theyre trying to make the most of it
3457617 republicans are trying to keep the issue alive because it works for them and the data suggests that the issue is working
3457618 have this thing that says drill offshore in the protected areas we can do that we can have a vote on that
3457619 theres clearly a lot at play right now and its hard to predict what votes we actually may see in the fall but what were focused on in august is having our folks in districts talking to their members of congress about why drilling is not a useful enterprise
3457620 people are so scared right now that theyre not really seeing a choice they want to do anything that might have an impact on gas prices

3457625 i have great admiration for what dave has built in such a short timeframe at torbreck
3457626 torbreck is an established brand that has become recognized as an icon of barossa valley winemaking this new partnership gives us the opportunity to enable torbrecks distinction and renown to transcend australia just as i believe quiviras zinfandels and rh ne varietal wines will one day transcend the dry creek valley
3457627 having two wineries functioning in different hemispheres offers staff members of both companies the opportunity to gain valuable experience working with two crushes per year
3457628 the constant flow of information and education is invaluable and our stagiers and interns have always been an important component of torbrecks approach to furthering the wine tradition

3457769 but with iphones continued strong success which only took apple a year to achieve a number 2 ranking it may be sooner than later that apple is challenging the blackberry a notion that would have seemed impossible to many a year or two ago

3457784 parliamentary blocs should show some flexibility and try to compromise to reach an agreement
3457785 i expect that the kurds would make some concessions regarding article 24 of the provincial elections law due to international and popular pressure
3457786 parliamentary blocs need more time to come to a consensus with other blocs

3457796 the franchise really depends on me coming up with a good idea
3457797 when we heard the cubs had offered 48 5 million we upped our offer to 50 million but fukudome not only wished to play right field but wanted to be the first japanese player on his new club
3457798 we already had jerome dye in right field and tadahito iguchi was our first japanese player so that ended that
3457799 i love you more than any reptile in the world and you need to be very happy and safe for me
3457800 finally someone who knows what to do with this thing
3457801 you are nothing you piece o sheet my son is in law school
3457802 thats what i dont like about hillary she can whip up crocodile tears but woman aint real
3457803 i dont believe that even from a religious point of view that jesus ever discriminated toward anyone nor do i theres never been a statement made by me about curing homosexuality people are using that in order to incite anger and to twist my whole platform on it theres no crusade for curing it or to convert everyone this is just for those who come to me and ask for change
3457804 i have clearly stated my belief that gays and lesbians are our brothers and sisters and should be provided the respect dignity and rights of all other citizens i have consistently spoken directly to african american religious leaders about the need to overcome the homophobia that persists in some parts our community so that we can confront issues like hiv aids and broaden the reach of equal rights in this country i strongly believe that african americans and the lgbt community must stand together in the fight for equal rights and so i strongly disagree with reverend mcclurkins views and will continue to fight for these rights as president of the united states to ensure that america is a country that spreads tolerance instead of division
3457805 im not rejecting people as god loves we love i dont reject thieves i reject thievery
3457806 what is that whore promising to do with them behind the bleachers

3457808 i see it as a stop for many pilgrims and visitors who want to learn something about father damien and mother marianne and the kalaupapa history
3457809 i think many believe a new church would be a welcome addition to kaunakakai
3457810 has reached alarming numbers more than 33 million infected and more than 2 million have died from the disease in 2007 and during that same year 2 5 million new individuals have contracted it there has never been such an extreme epidemic that has threatened the entire world
3457811 that the catholic church neglects this issue as with other infirmities even contagious ones the love of christ has led those who care for those affected to even risk their own lives
3457812 the church loves aids patients too and cares for them with love
3457813 the most common position is that of providing for safe sex through the use of condoms the catholic church however proposes other more positive ways and that puts her against the tide in seeking the comprehensive good of persons the condom is a cork its not always effective proposals should lead to educating people in true love
3457814 sexuality is not a toy sexuality is the carnal expression of human love which god has placed in the human heart
3457815 in this field of aids as in all fields that include the proper use of sexuality the church presents the proposal of true love which brings with it a proper education in the virtue of chastity
3457816 make unbridled use of their own sexuality in the name of greater freedom at first this sounds good but going down this path man becomes a slave of his own selfishness and he will never learn to truly love
3457817 curiously the statistics on aids infection fly in the face of these proposals by going down this road we head toward moral ruin
3457818 concrete experiences such as that of uganda where this proposal has been put in practice at catholic hospitals have reduced aids infections from 80 to 10 no other program has achieved such drastic reductions
3457819 the solution to aids will come by adhering to gods plan who has given to man man woman the gift of sexuality in order to express true love to learn to love is true education
3457820 until youve lost your reputation you never realize what a burden it was or what freedom really is
3457821 ah but i was so much older then im younger than that now
3457822 this is not a novel to be tossed lightly aside it should be thrown with great force
3457823 who are you going to sell it to if we dont buy it there are no pipelines to china
3457824 all his liberal speeches which he made in berlin and elsewhere are forgotten

3457826 now he can cruise the volga for all the remaining years or can go right to the bahamas
3457827 i must admit that for the first time in my life i felt admiration for the skill with which vladimir putin maintains his power
3457828 the less drugs you take the more sex you need

3457837 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
3457838 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient
3457839 our old receivables were real high and were a real mess
3457840 if you questioned amedisys about anything they would push you out and label you as a troublemaker
3457841 the worst thing that happens to you can be the best thing for you if you dont let it get the best of you
3457842 for christs love compels us because we are convinced that one died for all and therefore all died and he died for all that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised again so from now on we regard no one from a worldly point of view though we once regarded christ in this way we do so no longer therefore if anyone is in christ he is a new creation the old has gone the new has come all this is from god who reconciled us to himself through christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation that god was reconciling the world to himself in christ not counting mens sins against them and he has committed to us the message of reconciliation
3457843 we are blessed with vocations and their educational backgrounds and interests are important to us we dont take them to turn them into a standard dominican product but there is a strong dominican formation and that is a strong intellectual formation
3457844 but of course because truth is one there will be a common core of understanding and an appreciation of the economy of salvation in the catholic church
3457845 we were founded to combat against the albigensian heresy an essentially dualist heresy which separated the body from the soul our contemporary world suffers from a similar sort of sense of separation and the dominican way of life which offers a coherent whole has never been more necessary
3457846 we are a hinge between the apostolic tradition and the monastic tradition because we live together pray together but also go out and preach the truth of the gospel
3457847 because people deserve to have sense made or to be helped to make sense themselves of the faith that has been revealed to us
3457848 people deserve to hear a good sermon for that to be done it doesnt just take pastoral experience it means hard thinking hard studying about theology to think well about theology requires the study of philosophy as well
3457849 as dominicans we have a passion for truth but that has got to involve learning that things are often more complicated than we think and as a kind of fundamental dominican asceticism which is detachment from that which isnt wholly true actually surrendering some of our prejudices our half truths the shorthand we often live by we have to be prepared to give that up and focus on the truth of what god has revealed and thinking hard about it really
3457850 theres a kind of sympathetic hearing which then has to lead to critical reflection its not saying everythings true when patently some things are not but it serves to work out what the truth is
3457851 if you look at st thomass summa he is very much interested in the objections that are going to be put forward its allowing the objections to sharpen up ones sense of what the correct answer is
3457852 the ideal thing about the order was the balance between the contemplative and the active because id approached catholicism through the monastic lens that sort of thing seemed very attractive to me yet i recognised that i have that sort of extrovert side that i would really want to go out and do something with that contemplation
3457853 we all should be looking forward to the challenges going into a place like that takes you out of your comfort zone but thats exactly what we are supposed to do i really feel that we wouldnt be effective in our preaching mission if we didnt do that
3457854 to help them see the connection between their studies and pastoral care that the studies are not just for an academic purpose but that they are preparing them for the mission the way we do it always requires study because its a preaching and a theological mission wherever we do it
3457855 we can preach a message there that there is a way forward through christ and we give them as much help as we can if its one to one catechesis thats required or something like that or just to generally talk about faith
3457856 if you could read america ferreras mind it would say
3457857 you tend to think of observer com as the go to for what type of news
3457858 in the heat of the moment everybody can get carried away
3457859 but its important that we respect referees and opponents and its important for us as professionals to give a good example
3457860 its up to us as a group of players to move forward and make sure we are responsible for our actions on the pitch
3457861 its up to the players to show more respect to referees
3457862 i hold my hands up and say that at times i have over stepped the mark but we are here to move forward this is a step in the right direction
3457863 its down to us as a group of players and referees to get a consistent base
3457864 its going to be a continuing relationship with referees we are looking to move it forward and i think we can its down to me to take responsibility for my team mates before they get that booking
3457865 i think the idea is terrific its designed to cut out excesses and thats what we are trying to do
3457866 everybody is signed up to make it work and it will be great if it does

3457877 overall when you adjust for currency the sales were pretty much in line with expectations maybe even just a little light
3457878 as we go out through the rest of the year with the dollar strengthening currency could do a 180 and start being a negative rather than a positive
3457879 we have to see how theyll do against the macro headwinds impacting the u s and europe through the rest of the year especially with consumer spending under a cloud both domestically and now in europe
3457880 we know oxidants produce free radicals that damage cells our experiments show ruthenium produces a reaction in the cell which destroys its anti oxidant defence glutathione thus destroying the cancer infected cell
3457881 working with colleagues in edinburgh university and oncosense weve proved this could be an effective line of defence against cancer
3457882 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3457883 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen
3457884 lin miaoke was the best in this and yang peiyis voice was the most outstanding
3457885 personal branding is noise its talking about ones self instead of talking about something thats useful to others but another way you might look at it is that personal branding is leverage once you know me you start to build a relationship with me once we have a relationship i can share even more with you
3457886 will you dance with me lady waters for the fire dies in your grate and your guests have gone and your lords asleep and the plague has reached your estate

3457889 you must take from me what is mine ill return to you and submit to you
3457890 you must take it all with good grace for i have the plague on my body and i have the plague on my face
3457891 the wyndham championship plays a crucial role as the last opportunity for competitors to position themselves well for the playoff run this in addition to the return to sedgefield country club brings an additional layer of excitement to the event
3457892 we are excited to be back at sedgefield the course is spectacular and sure to become one of the premier stops on the pga tour
3457893 we expect a tremendously successful tournament that will be embraced by the players the many fans in the triad and the millions of television viewers
3457894 ive always played well in north carolina for some reason and just kind of love the style of golf there

3457899 weve got several guys who can do a lot of things for us
3457900 keith and j j have the potential to be very special players rudell has been very good throughout camp now that he is fully healed from his injuries from last season ron and jimmy have been solid as well and give us the ability to break big runs inside and outside

3457904 the question is not if hydrogen powered vehicles will be available commercially but when
3457905 these cars here will be the first generation the second and third generations will be needed before we move to products with hundreds of thousand or millions are made a year
3457906 so it will probably take no less than eight years and no more than 12 years before you get to that level that we have seen with the prius hybrid

3457922 russia had been close to us for years it will defend us the us and europe wont
3457923 why did saakashvili take on russia with 10 000 soldiers maybe he was thinking somebody would help us but nobody did help us
3457924 he was covered in blood there was no time to find out but he wasnt moving
3457925 like all great travelers i have seen more than i remember and remember more than i have seen
3457926 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
3457927 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
3457928 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
3457929 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets

3457934 this is a planning took where all things are going
3457935 this particular air force exercise is important because india is included among some very important allies
3457936 this is definitely an extension of an arc that has been mapped out since 2000 and it really signifies that what india and the united states have is a strategic relationship
3457937 theres no bitterness they made the decision and they stand by it
3457938 im just disappointed because i feel i have a lot to offer
3457939 like ive done throughout my career whether its been with england or at county level ive proved people wrong and i will certainly prove the cricket management wrong next season and hopefully keep proving them wrong
3457940 its a decision our cricket committee have made to enable a little bit of movement to open up opportunities for some of our younger players in the wings
3457941 with a player such as dominic in the last year of a contract he was obviously looking for a little bit of clarity to whats going to happen to enable him to plan for the future
3457942 hes put his heart and soul into lancashire cricket and its with a heavy heart that he moves on
3457943 hes still very committed to lancashires championship campaign this season
3457944 and he would enjoy nothing better than to have success in that competition
3457945 dominic is a top performer and is one of my signings as well i brought him to lancashire

3458183 iraq is a very wealthy country enormous oil reserves they can finance largely finance the reconstruction of their own country and i have no doubt that they will
3458184 the likely economic effects of a war in iraq would be relatively small under every plausible scenario the negative effect will be quite small relative to the economic benefits
3458185 it is unimaginable that the united states would have to contribute hundreds of billions of dollars and highly unlikely that we would have to contribute even tens of billions of dollars
3458186 iraq has tremendous resources that belong to the iraqi people and so there are a variety of means that iraq has to be able to shoulder much of the burden for their own reconstruction
3458187 when it comes to reconstruction before we turn to the american taxpayer we will turn first to the resources of the iraqi government and the international community
3458188 there is a lot of money to pay for this that doesnt have to be us taxpayer money and it starts with the assets of the iraqi people we are talking about a country that can really finance its own reconstruction and relatively soon
3458189 the united states is very committed to helping iraq recover from the conflict but iraq will not require sustained aid
3458190 we are talking about a country that can really finance its own reconstruction and relatively soon

3458228 this formalizes our request to the city for annexation then it is a dead deal
3458229 i dont know what youre really considering other than asking us to hook up
3458230 when the county and college acres residents were first notified they need to hook up i think weve been acting prudently at the city commission level whats occurred is the residents have come and dont think they have a problem and asked not to be annexed
3458231 what they asked for was to hook up without annexation they know that the state is telling them theyre not going to be able to stay on that sewer what their request was that the commission allow them to hook up without being annexed
3458232 the only thing they have told you is they want your sewer but we dont want to be in the city
3458233 they have said they dont have a problem and want you to fight for them with kdhe

3458236 this is absolutely government at its worst this decision should have been made weeks ago
3458237 we have a request from residents not to annex them and the county not to annex them
3458238 irregardless of what i think and you think at this point in time because were not going to agree we have a resolution to formally ask that you annex them
3458239 we have been asked to fix a problem that isnt ours
3458240 i take great disappointment in the way you have condemned the city commission
3458241 you will pass something today that if you did it 18 months ago it would be over today you sent it to us to do the heavy lifting you guys failed because you didnt take care of it either for you to make statements to the paper it is disrespectful to the city if these people think the city dropped the ball you should take a look at your issues what you have done for 18 months is keep passing it off to the city and saying we have the power to take care of this ourselves but were not going to do it
3458242 thank you you said that was enough and that is enough
3458243 i agree that this whole thing could have been avoided
3458244 i know you the county have given us 100 percent
3458245 you have gone to the city and asked what we asked i dont think you got an answer either
3458246 the ordinance says they have to be annexed with an exception to the county to form rural districts

3458318 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

3458600 we designed the computer simulations to show that as the ocean temperature increased hurricanes would form more rapidly and easily even in the presence of wind shear
3458601 instead we got exactly the opposite result as the water temperature increased the effectiveness of the wind shear in suppressing hurricane formation actually became greater
3458602 what this study shows is that doctors should be doing regular monitoring of these children over time because a one time checkup might not be enough to tell if they are at risk for developing diabetes
3458603 to better treat at risk children we need better ways to monitor beta cell function and visceral fat buildup
3458604 those are tough to measure but are probably the main factors determining who will get type 2 diabetes
3458605 the study provides great insight into the risk factors that lead to the progression towards type 2 diabetes in this population

3458631 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3458632 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3458633 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3458634 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3458635 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3458636 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3458637 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3458667 one of these areas is work on situated cognition i e thinking as tied to a body that has experiences in the world this work argues that human learning is not just a matter of what foes on inside peoples heads but is fully embedded in situated within a material social and cultural world
3458668 another one of these areas is the so called new literacy studies a body of work that argues that reading and writing should be viewed not only as mental achievements going on inside peoples heads but also as social and cultural practices with economic historical and political implications
3458669 the third area is work on so called connectionism a view that stresses the ways in which human beings are powerful pattern recognizers this body of work argues that humans dont often think best when they attempts to reason via logic and general abstract principles detached from experience rather they think best when they reason on the basis of patterns they have picked up through their actual experiences in the world patterns that over time can become generalized but that are still rooted in specific areas of experience
3458670 debate over violence in video games is one more way in which we want to talk about technology or drugs for that matter doing things to people rather than talking about the implications of peoples overall social and economic contexts
3458671 in fact in many high school and college textbooks in the sciences images not only take up more space they now carry meanings that are independent of the words in the text if you cant read these images you will not be able to recover their meanings from the words in the text as was more usual in the past
3458672 important knowledge now usually gained in school is content in the sense of information rooted in or at least related to intellectual domains or academic disciplines like physics history art or literature work that does not involve such learning is meaningless activities that are entertaining but that themselves do not involve such learning are just meaningless play of course video games fall into that category
3458673 but things work in the world in certain ways because people make them do so or at the very least are willing to accept them as such then when they work that way people come to expect them to do so and build values and norms around them working that way
3458674 critical learning as i am defining it here involves learning to think of semiotic domains as design spaces that manipulate us in certain way and that we can manipulate in certain ways
3458675 the content of video games when they are played actively and critically is something like this they situate meaning in a multimodal space through embodied experiences to solve problems and reflect on the intricacies of the design of imagined worlds and the design of both real and imagined social relationships and identities in the modern world
3458676 the first strategy calling on a previous experience is an example of what learning theorists call transfer an example of transfer at work would be a case where a student applies something he or she has learned about reasoning in biology to a new problem faced in a social studies class transfer does not always work and can be dangerous transfer requires active learning and if it is not to be dangerous critical learning
3458677 the learner learns that while school sometimes sets up problems so that the earlier solutions transfer directly to later ones this rarely happens in real life the learner adapts and transforms the earlier experiences to be transferred to the new problem through creativity and innovation
3458678 the learner also uses and is prepared to use what he or she discovers often by accident on the spot on the ground of practice while implementing the new transformed strategy this requires reflection not after or before action but in the midst of action the learner remains flexible adapting performance in action

3458754 pre workout and post workout nutrition is the key to get optimal results growth and recovery pre workout nutrition is necessary for maximum performance and will allow you to have increased muscle strength better endurance give you increased energy burn more calories and improve concentration
3458755 pre and post workout meals are just as critical to your muscle growth hypertrophy as the training these two processes work together to make your training program successful the rigors of training breaks down your body and you need proper nutrition and rest to rebuild your body bigger and better
3458756 studies have demonstrated that even in the presence of a relatively high carbohydrate intake and large insulin response the addition of protein to a carbohydrate meal can increase fat burning during exercise so it looks like a well designed pre during and post exercise intake will not only improve protein status and glycogen resynthesis but it may actually increase fat burning

3458759 if you eat a large meal just before you exercise you may experience nausea feel sluggish or end up with muscle cramps this happens because your body needs energy to digest the foods you eat so blood flow increases to your digestive system leaving less energy providing blood for muscles exercising on an empty stomach isnt good either skipping meals before exercising can cause low blood sugar which can make you to feel weak and light headed you also need some energy in the form of the right types of food to properly fuel your work out

3458806 the lord saved hezekiah amp the inhabitants of jerusalem from the hand of sennacherib the king of assyria amp from the hand of all others amp guided them on every side and many brought gifts to the lord at jerusalem amp presents to hezekiah king of judah so that he was exalted in the sight of all nations thereafter
3458807 that they are found in northern territory not controlled by assyrians seems to indicate that the conquest of samaria did not encompass all of israel
3458808 assyria was a cedar in lebanon all the great nations dwelt in its shadow the cedars in the garden of god could not hide it
3458809 assuming ahead of time that lmlk jars indicates autonomy seems to lead to circular reasoning maybe they did not
3458810 to explain the change in insignia by the abject submission to assyrian domination which took place either at the end of hezekiahs or the beginning of manassehs reign
3458811 i must agree with naaman hezekiahs court had much to fear with the assyrian power surrounding and bordering the kingdom
3458812 building a tunnel or sending a letter is not something that would provoke an assyrian offensive

3458818 in the second half of this year ubs does not expect to see any improvement in the adverse economic and financial market trends that affected this quarters results
3458819 the good news in these results is the break up of the group into three autonomous units because this allows for an eventual sale or part sale of the investment bank
3458820 we think we have reached the trough of the wave on the net new money outflow that would take time to come back to a more normal level
3458821 some of these weaknesses such as the blurring of the true risk reward profile of individual businesses are the source of substantial risk as we have seen in the past few months
3458822 others have led to the creation of excessively elaborate processes and unnecessary layers of complexity
3458823 it is an architectural structure with three arcs one in the front another in the inside section and a third in the back the gate stands 7 meters tall and its uniqueness lies in the use of such building technology at such an early time the excavation of the site its restoration and its conservation are generating great interest across the world and for us who are working to conserve the site this is a very important and exciting moment
3458824 one of the main problems with which we are dealing during the restoration is the slanting of the frontal tower forward and this requires complex work and great technical expertise

3458844 let me sing of my well beloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard my well beloved had a vineyard in a very fruitful hill and he digged it and cleared it of stones and planted it with the choicest vine and built a tower in the midst of it and also hewed out a vat therein and he looked that it should bring forth grapes and it brought forth wild grapes

3458847 hes not a hothead thats russian propaganda thats the way they would like to see him portrayed in the west
3458848 but i think it was a mistake for him to act as he did and the better policy would have been to show restraint did he make a tactical blunder the answer is almost certainly yes but i dont think it was more than a tactical blunder
3458849 i think he knew the russians were looking for an opportunity or a pretext to seize south ossetia and abkhazia he felt he had a last opportunity to consolidate south ossetia because the russian plan was already laid
3458850 he was a quite amazingly polished figure even then just an incredible polyglot and also had great charm and facility with dealing with people
3458851 he was very political and he was a strong advocate of open society democracy free market economics but i wouldnt say he was a nationalist he was very concerned about georgia and what was going to happen to georgia

3458870 the results were not great the market was pricing in half decent figures and thats what it got
3458871 in the real world its a good set of numbers a decent earnings beat and 7 percent underlying organic growth on the top line
3458872 however in light of the share price movement going into the results the in line underlying performance and unchanged guidance signify no incremental positives
3458873 nobodys feeling were out of the woods here but theres a distinctively more positive tone

3458887 this does not demonstrate the historicity of any of the events reported for jeremiahs life in the book of jeremiah however the demonstrably genuine bullae do show that the narratives in jeremiah are not complete fabrications of someones imagination they at least feature real people as characters

3458891 if rangers had still been in europe i think carlos would have stayed for another season
3458892 he would probably have liked another go at the champions league after all he isnt going to get that at aston villa
3458893 but with rangers out so early and with no uefa cup football either he must have thought it was time to go
3458894 its a major blow because no team likes to lose their best players and he had a great season for us
3458895 the player wanted to play in the premier league and its just sad that rangers and celtic seem to be a stepping stone for players these days
3458896 there was a time when other clubs were a stepping stone to the old firm but that is no longer the case
3458897 what rangers have got to do now is invest the money but in saying that every time they go for a player clubs will know that they have money to spend and they are desperate to sign that player that is not a good combination
3458898 but hopefully a younger player will come in to the defence someone who can be groomed for the future
3458899 the first thing walter smith did when he came back was to get the defence right and then build from there and he has to do it again
3458900 when i got text messages to tell me cuellar was off my first thought was that we had been betrayed
3458901 at the meeting on friday there had been no talk of exit clauses
3458902 we didnt think he would stay at ibrox forever and a day but i was stunned to hear he was going so soon
3458903 but martin bain phoned me to assure me that on friday there had been no indication of what was to come
3458904 he said that on saturday night carlos and his representative had asked for a meeting and that meeting took place the next day
3458905 martin told me how he had tried to persuade him to stay by offering him an improved deal but carlos wanted to go to england
3458906 so you have to accept that is the case but it doesnt lessen the hurt coming as it does on the back of the champions league qualifying defeat against fbk kaunas last week
3458907 i have to say i feel let down a bit by carlos and the u turn he has performed after saying that he wanted to stay
3458908 and it is very strange that they asked to leave on the sunday and on the monday there is an offer from aston villa on the table

3458965 peter and the nurse talked downstairs for what seemed like ages then i heard footsteps coming up the stairs peter said he thought her little black lacy pants with red flowers were saucy
3458966 then they went quiet and i imagine they were having sex instead of thinking about what peter was up to i concentrated on fleeing the house quickly

3459001 wanita itu dinikahi karena 4 hal karena kecantikannya karena keturunannya karena kekayaannya dan karena agamanya menangkanlah dengan memilih agamanya maka taribat yadaaka kembali kepada fitrah atau beruntung
3459002 janganlah seorang mukmin laki laki membenci mukmin perempuan bila dia membencinya dari satu sisi tapi akan menyayang dari sisi lain
3459003 well if theyre so rubbish how would you do any better pigeonhead mcyellsalot
3459004 you need all the information on these pills to decide if you should start using them or not
3459005 i started out at 200lbs and within two months went down to 170lbs during the 3rd month i went down to 162lbs i notice a big appetite change when i take the pill and dont i should have started this years ago
3459006 we conservatives believe that you dismissed our serious quest for responsible limited government
3459007 in your quest for the presidency we want to know if it is in you to become a passionate and forceful leader with a conservative agenda to fight the lure of socialistic programs promoted by sen barack obama
3459008 my hope is that these settlements will help the survivors and their families begin to heal and move forward
3459009 we must continue to do everything in our power to ensure the safety of the children in our care
3459010 that secret church documents about these pedophile priests will be made public
3459011 but i just couldnt bring myself to pull the lever and vote for you
3459012 because i dont think theres a lot of stigma in saying youre voting for john mccain
3459013 do you want to vote for the white guy or the black guy
3459014 the real frailty of our polls is that we get very high refusal rates and we survive because the people who we interview are like the people who we dont interview on most things
3459015 and to be honest with you this is something every pollster i know is concerned about
3459016 it was clear that people were having the first opportunity to vote for an african american and there was uncertainty
3459017 you know is he going to be fair is he just going to look out for his own people and who are his own people i think weve come a great distance from that ive seen the progress
3459018 racial attitudes and stereotypes that people in many cases are not aware they have
3459019 i dont think anyone is correct or incorrect including me
3459020 to get to the heart of that youd have to do the kinds of research that havent been done
3459021 i wouldnt want to be barack obama and up two points going into election day
3459022 were concentrating time and space for the breeder so he can do the job in his lifetime

3459036 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3459037 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3459038 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3459039 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3459040 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3459041 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3459042 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3459043 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3459044 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3459045 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3459046 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3459047 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3459048 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3459049 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3459050 the demand for mini notebooks will be driven by several factors by their small form factor and small screen their light weight their price their ease of use and their basic but sufficient pc functionality
3459051 mini notebooks are likely to attract a variety of users with different usage scenarios content consumption internet browsing e mail instant messaging im keeping in touch with friends and family storing and sharing pictures and so on potential users are likely to include both first time buyers seeking a low cost introductory pc as well as experienced users seeking a low cost second or third pc for themselves or a relative
3459052 mini notebooks create opportunities to reach some new pc buyers and expand within existing buyers across all regions
3459053 considering the majority of mini notebooks will be sold to consumers pc vendors will need to pay increasing attention to the design and ease of use of mini notebooks these will be two crucial factors in this segment
3459054 for consumer mini notebooks to succeed they need to be positioned differently than standard notebooks and pc vendors will need to decide if the existing channels to market are appropriate and possibly look for new channels such as telecom gadget shops and so on
3459055 pc vendors will have to convince retailers to take on those products as they are still emerging products and potentially present some risk from an inventory point of view
3459056 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3459057 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3459058 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3459059 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3459060 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3459061 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3459062 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3459063 who are open to doing something on the production side
3459064 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3459065 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3459066 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3459067 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3459068 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3459069 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3459070 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3459071 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3459072 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3459073 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3459074 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3459075 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3459076 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3459077 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3459078 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3459079 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3459080 i am pleased to report solid operating results for the quarter despite the difficult industry environment created by unrelentingly high fuel prices
3459081 the more resilient domestic canada market drove sustained revenue growth in the quarter and we achieved yield and unit growth through the successful introduction of a number of fare increases and fuel surcharges
3459082 im particularly proud of our employees who remained focused on our operation as we headed into the peak summer season
3459083 as the cost of travel for consumers is brought in line with the price of fuel we anticipate a softening in demand we will continue to manage the challenge through new revenue generation initiatives sound capacity management and continued focus on cost reduction i am confident that air canada is well positioned to compete successfully with a young efficient fleet award winning revenue model market leading product and especially with our employees who continue to demonstrate their professionalism and dedication to earning our customers loyalty
3459084 barack obama is about to make one of the most important decisions of this campaign choosing a running mate
3459085 you have helped build this movement from the bottom up and barack wants you to be the first to know his choice
3459086 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3459087 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3459088 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3459089 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

3459095 the tone of the fomc statement accompanying the widely anticipated decision to leave rates on hold was marginally more dovish than in late june but the fed is still leaving its options open with a neutral bias
3459096 last time the statement referred to continued increases in energy prices but now these prices are simply elevated
3459097 it will bring forward expectations for a rate cut that the market has already priced in
3459098 we still think that this is an unlikely case and we continue to argue that the bank of canada will not be in a position to make a move on rates until well into 2009
3459099 as we move along the arguments for a rate cut are going to get stronger
3459100 if anything i dont think a rate hike is anywhere in sight
3459101 scope to move to a less restrictive monetary policy stance in the period ahead is increasing
3459102 recent indications are that a significant moderation in domestic demand is now occurring
3459103 in addition to the effects of tighter financial conditions other factors including a slowing in global growth declining asset markets and higher fuel costs are acting to restrain domestic spending and activity
3459104 the rbas detailed quarterly somp confirmed an easing bias but there was little in the statement to support speculation of a more aggressive 50bp cut in september
3459105 accordingly risk reward argues for the rba to begin its easing cycle sooner rather than later and we now expect the first cut at the upcoming september meeting rather than october while the debate over a 25bp or 50bp cut will wax and wane in the coming weeks both cases have merit
3459106 may be just what is required to blunt the economic bears out there anything with a positive number one has to say really detracts from the near term rate easing case
3459107 the ecb is in a wait and see position to assess new information regarding the outlook for inflation and economic growth
3459108 in toughening the language regarding indirect effects of the rise in food and energy prices the ecb remains a hawkish tilt
3459109 given that trichet repeated that the banks sole focus in line with its mandate is to contain these inflation pressures the risk of another rate hike cannot be ruled out
3459110 one of the most challenging periods since its inception with conflicting growth and inflation trends demanding a very patient policy stance
3459111 however the nature of the banks mandate stipulates that inflation is the top priority and with so much uncertainty of when cpi inflation eventually starts to slow the bank has no other option but to keep interest rates at 4 25 regardless of the worsening growth backdrop
3459112 the sharp deterioration of economic conditions in the uk will prevent the boe from tightening its monetary policy despite inflation at very high levels and still expected on the upside
3459113 we expect the status quo until february 2009 from that date the boe could envisage to ease the monetary policy two 25 bp cuts in february and may 2009
3459114 it has not attempted to prevent inflation moving away from the target following the sharp rises in commodity prices to do so would have required a large increase in interest rates with such a severe impact on output and employment that it would have risked inflation falling well below target further out
3459115 the bank of japan boj is in no more hurry to intervene than it has been over the past few months
3459116 if we exclude energy and fresh food inflation continued to dwell in negative territory 0 1 moreover high oil prices and the american economic slump are increasing the risk of recession in japan
3459117 the fog hanging over japans economy will stick around for the time being
3459118 he vivido con esto por muchos a os pero no me preocupa yo siempre he sido brad que el otro se cambie el nombre
3459119 a l le gusta que lo reconozcan por su talento no por su nombre
3459120 its not really where my career goals are focused right now
3459121 im really looking down the line pretty far and this might be a step backwards
3459122 you know steve sanders lives on in our hearts and in our minds
3459123 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3459124 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3459125 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3459126 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3459127 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3459128 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3459129 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3459130 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3459131 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3459132 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3459133 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3459134 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3459135 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3459136 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3459137 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3459138 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3459139 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3459140 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3459141 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3459142 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3459143 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3459144 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3459145 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3459146 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3459147 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3459148 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3459149 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3459150 do you have people skills we can teach the rest
3459151 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3459152 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3459153 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3459154 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3459155 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3459156 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3459157 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3459158 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3459159 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3459160 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3459161 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3459162 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3459163 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3459164 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3459165 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3459166 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees

3459175 as i said i think the presumed spin is designed to excuse us inaction in the face of an utter lack of means to respond to russia but i do think there was an element of true surprise on the part of the us from landay
3459176 we knew they were going to go crack heads we told them again and again not to do this
3459177 we thought we had an understanding with the russians that any response would be south ossetia focused
3459178 just the prospect of a larger regional war that could drag in russia and involve the united states as well since early 2002 the u s government has given a healthy amount of military aid to georgia when i last visited south ossetia georgian troops manned a checkpoint outside tskhinvali decked out in surplus u s army uniforms and new body armor the first u s aid came under the rubric of the georgia train and equip program ostensibly to counter alleged al qaeda influence in the pankisi gorge then under the sustainment and stability operations program georgia returned the favor committing thousands of troops to the multi national coalition in iraq last fall the georgians doubled their contingent making them the third largest contributor to the coalition not bad for a nation of 4 6 million people

3459256 i didnt even know it was possible until earlier this year when bob
3459257 four years ago i just wanted to race those guys but i hate to lose and getting third in the 200m freestyle four years ago when i lose in circumstances like that it motivates me more to try to swim faster

3459264 i have so many races so much to do in every race i have to keep 100 per cent focused
3459265 at this level i do believe it is more a mental game than it is anything and it takes a certain amount of guts to do what michael is doing

3459283 i dont think the conflict will have big consequences at least if it doesnt escalate
3459284 the main problem for russia is that investor perception which was already low will deteriorate even further
3459285 the very fact of the conflict is not putting investors in the mood to invest in russia
3459286 the events themselves of course have an influence on the outflow of capital but they cant significantly change the fundamentals
3459287 russia is a very strong country in terms of economic development
3459288 the country is trying to enter the world trade organization and this armed conflict with georgia will make that process even more difficult
3459289 the conflict with georgia empowers the hardliners in russia economic reform in russia will be delayed
3459290 russia is an immediate neighbor you cant wish it doesnt exist
3459291 i dont think europeans will say we dont want to have to do anything with this country but europeans will think we trusted too much that russia would become more like a western country
3459292 theres no doubt that whats happening has increased the investment risk within georgia and the region
3459293 this is one more step by the russians trying to increase their power among their former satellites that raises questions over further foreign investment in georgia as well as countries like azerbaijan and ukraine

3459303 i actually think that given the number of comments made from industry executives at e3 or thereabouts about how they didnt put enough resources against development of wii games that the industry has realized that the old adage of only first party games sell on nintendo systems is absolutely incorrect i think youre right that the data will cause a few eyebrows to lift
3459304 total third party sales for the xbox 360 since launch is currently 67 929 999 units followed by the wii at 33 394 311 units and the playstation 3 at 19 976 325 units
3459305 third party sales for the xbox 360 since the launch of the wii and ps3 is 54 065 728 units still almost double the wiis 33 394 311 units
3459306 no matter how you slice it the wii third party game story is not a pretty one
3459307 sold 60 million total software units where 56 percent are third party units or 33 million keep in mind that this does not include wii sports since its in pack with the hardware it is not counted as a software sale
3459308 35 million software units 84 percent of which were third party or 29 million total
3459309 we have hundreds of kilometers of beaches that arent developed and its a waste said the then honduran tourism secretary iht ana abarca in 2001
3459310 the british invasion of saint vincent in 1796 prompted a forced migration of the black caribs first to jamaica and soon thereafter to the island of roatan which today belongs to honduras
3459311 as roatan is quite small and infertile the garifuna struggled to subsist
3459312 our culture is based upon establishing a harmony with our natural environment
3459313 it is the garifuna communities two most salient attributes the simple beauty of their territory and the uniqueness of their vibrant culture that pose a threat to their existence
3459314 we dont want the mega tourist industry here says miriam miranda executive committee member of ofraneh black fraternal organization of honduras the most prominent organization representing the garifuna people
3459315 the utmost peril against the garifuna people today is the loss of our land
3459316 starting in 1992 the marbella tourist corporation and other foreign investors in complicity with local authorities and military personnel began usurping property rights within the triunfo de la cruz community facing the risk of losing communal land titles local and national organizations came together to expose the corruption and managed so suspend the fraudulent operations
3459317 we find ourselves in a what can only be conceived as a war like situation
3459318 such mega development valued at us 161 million seeks to promote honduras image as a top notch touristic destination
3459319 in miami and tornabe the company has managed to buy off several local leaders
3459320 here we will resist until our death only in coffins will they manage to get us out of here
3459321 in addition by drying out the body of water neighboring communities are left unprotected to the rising number of tropical storms and hurricanes which develop in the caribbean
3459322 international financial organizations are also playing a role in this conflict
3459323 what will happen to my kids the day im no longer around i will not sell out i want them to have this land after me
3459324 the garifuna essence our customs traditions and language are all directly tied to our lifestyle
3459325 any brother who wants to share our cosmovision is welcome but we do not want this touristic mega project here
3459326 we built them for the tourists as sun shelters we want them to come visit us
3459327 we want a project that belongs to us we dont want outsiders to come and exploit us or remove us from our ancestral lands we want to develop an eco tourism industry which is ours and which will sustain our garifuna cosmovision and respect the natural environment

3459336 we know you did it because we have an eyewitness that puts you at the scene of the crime
3459337 people who are highly anxious fearful depressed delusional or otherwise psychologically disordered and people who are mentally retarded are particularly prone to confess under pressure
3459338 i believe the fact that the obama campaign has already deployed the field staff they have and the fact that every part of this state is being targeted means that senator obama will not repeat the kerry mistake
3459339 i have never seen a presidential campaign in ohio come anywhere close to where this campaign is organizationally and in terms of having actual man and woman power in the field
3459340 the neighbor to neighbor approach is exactly the way we need to go about it here to win
3459341 is senator obama going to win every county is he going to win every region probably not but in some of these heavily republican counties we can go from 29 percent to perhaps 38 percent and in some counties we can go from 38 percent to 44 percent so im confident that the strategy thats being followed here will be effective because its going to be an attempt to reach every voter in every part of ohio
3459342 we like to say that there are 11 million pairs of eyes to ensure good government in ohio
3459343 after living in and serving our community for twenty years i have become intimately familiar with our community needs when i am elected to the state senate i will be able to help more people more neighborhoods and more communities and work towards the improvement of new york state as a whole
3459344 unfortunately in the ethnic cleansing being carried out by the burmese military junta in eastern burma rape is being used as a tool of war as it is in darfur
3459345 the obvious purpose in my view is to destroy the fabric of the community if the women are raped they are obviously shamed in the eyes of their community often times the husbands divorce the women who are left alone
3459346 victimised by the fighters and then be victimised by the men that you love
3459347 it is very very painful and for the women it is pain you live with all your life
3459348 as for the girls you can imagine the trauma and sometimes i would look at the eyes of the women in the camp and just wonder whether she is one of those who was raped and what is going on in her heart and mind
3459349 within the space of the hour that i had with them ive heard of seven tell the stories of their gang rape
3459350 one woman was 35 years old and she had been raped by several of the janjaweed arab militia in sudan and by the time she saw her husband he already knew she was raped and he divorced her on the spot leaving her with eight children
3459351 obviously if you do this to enough communities you destroy the family you destroy the fabric of a community and if you do it throughout enough villages you can shred the fabric of an ethnic group which is what they are doing in darfur and which is what they have done in the eastern part of burma

3459383 it is our choices harry that show what we truly are far more than our abilities
3459384 im thirsty can you point me to the soda pop aisle
3459385 people want choices people want the opportunity to make their own decisions
3459386 they come in and they look and they go were overwhelmed
3459387 since reagan the ideology in the united states has been that choice is good and more choice is better and to the extent that you can give people more choice in every area of life you are improving their well being
3459388 nobody has the time or the expertise to make informed choices about everything
3459389 when options are presented people have a tough time just ignoring them
3459390 its wonderful that we can sit down in our living room and order 20 000 things in a superficial way we are more informed than people used to be but its hard to get our attention and i dont see any way of turning that around
3459391 the era of choice the ability to choose and its transformation of contemporary life
3459392 his assessment is bleak by 1900 peoples faith in established institutions like church and government began a slow wane and americans struggled to find their bearings

3459394 and accurately or not todays citizens often think that they do
3459395 the only way were going to solve our problems in this country is if all of us come together
3459396 we are fellow americans and that shared distinction means more to me than any other association
3459397 theres no way were going back to the times of zachary taylor
3459398 its not is too much information bad its how do you manage within an environment that does provide all information and will continue to provide all information
3459399 with more choices out there if leaders want to bring issues to the attention of the public they have to bring it into our venues and speak it on our terms
3459400 institutions are breaking down and there are going to be new ways of doing things but the cream can still rise the signal can still make it through the noise in this new environment
3459401 you dont need 90 percent of the public informed on the issue and following it closely to get your policy passed
3459402 not everybody was running around yelling yeah yeah liberty death
3459403 there are lessons for us and for our leaders in the people of colonial williamsburg they too had choices far more abundant than their predecessors
3459404 this country is an experiment and for it to have endured for this long it requires the involvement of citizens citizens making choices
3459405 where are those conversations we had like patrick henry on the steps
3459406 you have to uphold the merit system the merit system does not include unjust dismissals of competent civil servants
3459407 oversaw the moderation of policy and refinement of message that culminated in the sask partys landslide victory last fall
3459408 krawetz insisted all of the dismissals were handled with sensitivity however the transition team deemed that all those dismissed even those without identifiable political connections did not fit with the direction and philosophy of the new government
3459409 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3459410 i started zeus and company when i realized that nutritious food for pets was hard to find now more and more people are becoming educated and see the numerous benefits of feeding all natural healthy foods
3459411 having a narcotics detection and tracking canine team provides a unique opportunity to promote a safe community
3459412 in diesem zusammenhang sind wir vor allem ber soziale und wirtschaftliche aspekte des weiteren lebens des multinationalen volkes georgiens besorgt denn gerade im gus rahmen wurden gegenseitig vorteilhafte konomische humanit re und sonstige zwischenstaatliche beziehungen abgewickelt

3459417 i may sound crazy saying im doing this so my son can play high school ball and then college ball and maybe move on from there but were devoted to our kids
3459418 not only are kids getting into it earlier but theres a huge market with pitching hitting speed and agility lessons and everybodys swinging a worth prodigy lithium bat that costs 200
3459419 in the last 10 years or so we have seen a noticeable difference in the number of younger kids 8 and 9 years old playing travel ball
3459420 i guarantee you i spent 15 000 hotels gas food all kinds of things ive got 1 000 in bats but i love it
3459421 to a certain extent its been going on quite some time but it is getting younger and younger and im not so sure thats good
3459422 there is no way you can protect those kids arms
3459423 it is our choices harry that show what we truly are far more than our abilities

3459427 its not always easy when youre a consultant but we try to be as accommodating as possible so our consultants can work close to home and not miss out on their familys activities

3459456 one thing about paris hilton and her energy policy is that she brings energy to about whatever she does and she said that she was hot that
3459457 i guarantee old or not with paris hilton talking about energy them fellas barack obama and john mccain will be listening probably watching too
3459458 we d bypass them evan williams fellas who tried to insert themselves into the political process and influence the voters of kentucky that re doing here we re trying to get the energy right view story
3459459 a growing number of post production facilities are embracing autodesk toxik as a companion to autodesk maya
3459460 as the entertainment industry grapples with the challenges of stereoscopic production toxik 2009 bridges 3d and 2d workflows facilitating the production of stereoscopic films and virtual set extensions
3459461 were already working with autodesk maya and autodesk flame so toxik was a natural choice for our pipeline it gives us the power of a node based compositor necessary for professional high end post production work along with a look and feel thats completely comfortable

3459463 what are you saying this cannot be true i saw the king a couple of days ago he was just fine
3459464 hey we dont like this anymore than you do im telling you no one is happy about this situation in fact the only thing the allow us to go on is the fact that you will be dead in about 30 years time at maximum probably a lot less and then we will have a new king a better king a real king one might say
3459465 believe me weve all asked ourself the very same question
3459466 it is the law if there was any other option believe me wed take it
3459467 im dreaming this is not happening im not cut out to rule over an entire kingdom go away
3459468 your first task as king will be to decide who will be your royal councellor and i suggest you pick me
3459469 i dont think i can handle this are you sure theres no other way
3459470 unfortunately i am your highness abdication is prohibited by law the only way you can possibly get out of this is by dying how about that for an idea
3459471 i think thats enough for your first day dont worry i will take care of all matters of urgency for you until youve made piece with your destiny
3459472 theres got to be a map of this place somewhere
3459473 you might some day become the king of this land
3459474 dont kill me im not worth it please spare me why does bad things always happen to me this week
3459475 im not here to kill you i would never go through this much trouble to kill a mortal
3459476 ive got my hands full if you havent noticed i was just crowned king a couple of days ago find someone else please
3459477 well i know you recently earned the position of king i am actually responsible for that i am the god of this land agagaffa as you mortals
3459478 you did this to me actually please kill me dying is way better than living this hell
3459479 i wont kill you that would spoil all the fun as i told you earlier ive got a mission for you and since i am your god you have no option but to obey my command
3459480 oh crap yes crap i say can my life get any worse than this
3459481 oh believe me it can and it will that is not a threat by the way that is a promise
3459482 i want you to go to war your neighbour celenia has been bothering me for quite some time now well actually celenia have done nothing to offend me as such but their official god the god of mountain and valleys allways beat me at craps he is probably cheating but it is impolite to imply something like that that is why i have chosen this route instead
3459483 but why did you have to kill the king and the prince they would have won that war for you for sure something you cannot possibly count on me to do
3459484 king persipal iv had a great sense for strategy and he was known throughout the world for his bravery and skill with a sword ever heard of stealing candy from a child no way i could make a profit betting on this war with those odds with you in charge on the other hand i will get 134 1 odds now thats a profit plus it will be appealing to my malicious side to see you out there on the battle field
3459485 im fascinated by something new every week i cant commit to afraid ill miss something better i start so many things but finish almost none of them i know i should focus on one thing but which one
3459486 unlike people who are satisfied with one area of interest youre genetically wired to pursue many areas and thats exactly what youve been trying to do but because your behavior is unfamiliar even unsettling to the people around you youve been taught that youre doing something wrong and told you must decide on one path
3459487 a scanner must find a way to follow every path that interest her theres nothing else a scanner can do for three compelling reasons a scanner cant have fewer interest they are designed to do more second scanners dont want fewer interest finally scanners can so they must explore many things most scanners arent as attached to stability as other people they seem to have retained the inborn security of a young child the same love of whats new the drive to learn and understand everything they see
3459488 they enable the creation of 3d models from simple 2d images and dynamic virtual environments from conventional photographs these products are used on many types of projects from architecture and photography to film and game development

3459490 since the beginning stitcher has consistently been the fastest and most user friendly panoramic image editor
3459491 it remains the software of choice for our panoramic projects autodesk stitcher 2009 with its graphics accelerated previews and renders as well as the new automated features will make it even more indispensable to our panoramic workflows
3459492 they mobilize themselves without a need for a central location to do so distribute the targets discuss the attack approaches come up with a plan on the coordination and you have everyone participating
3459493 a bunch of youth groups posted something that was almost a manifesto that called on supporter to wage an information war against georgia
3459494 in the ongoing russian versus georgia cyberwar we have an indication of lists of georgian governmental sites actively distributed across russian web forums
3459495 by posting on blogs and forums instructions that essentially say this is what were going to do but we dont know whos behind that
3459496 georgian hackers or pro georgian hackers launched distributed denial of service attacks against ria novosti
3459497 especially in russia every time something happens there are attacks name any crisis there in the past year and i can point to a spike in attack traffic
3459498 countries visionary enough in the long term sort of tolerate hacking activities unless of course they target the countrys infrastructure in order for the country to later on mobilize them based on nationalist sentiments
3459499 we were both small town people doing very big things and we relied on each other dealing with fame
3459500 i dont know the phone will ring and itll be him and ill maybe not answer
3459501 we didnt have a fight no one cheated it plain didnt work
3459502 i dont want to name names even though he probably deserves it but he fooled around
3459503 you never really know why somebody wants to be around you or if they do genuinely like you
3459504 i wish everyone had a label on their forehead so you could automatically tell their intentions sometimes you just wish that no one wanted anything from you
3459505 but what if i dont earn any more next year
3459506 what if something awful happens im not at that point where i say ok ive made enough i dont know what the limit is

3459517 we work harder than the guys do because we have to
3459518 i talked to her and she was like carrie im sorry
3459519 the power of self promotion overcoming obstacles that get in your way
3459520 i got just a tiny bit more than that when my site was doing really well
3459521 modulation of brain activity to provide symptomatic relief from growing number of diseases such as parkinsons depression and epilepsy has become the treatment of choice when all other options fail
3459522 the interface between the cells of the brain and the surface of the implanted electrode determines whether these treatments work or not by coating electrode surfaces with carbon nanotubes we can improve the efficiency of this cell electrode interface by one thousand times or even more
3459523 for an electrophysiologist that is the difference the nanotube coated electrodes make in what we can see on our oscilloscopes
3459524 es gibt keine wirkungsvolle kontrolle die obersten richter haben das schlupfloch der raucherclubs abgesegnet eine juristische l sung ist damit gekippt w re also die politik am zuge nach der landtagswahl werden die karten mit sicherheit neu gemischt ein d mpfer f r die csu wird eine offizielle lockerung der regelung schnell in gang bringen und auch bei einem erfolg der christsozialen wird der kneipenalltag zeigen dass nicht alles staatlich reglementiert werden kann

3459528 im gutted of course because i was totally primed up to attend the media event but at this point in time im actually having difficulty getting out of bed
3459529 is pushing the boundaries of good taste too far for groups representing the mentally disabled
3459530 i think its open to interpretation and thats the great thing
3459531 you know if i want to protest something because it offends me thats my right as an american and its also any artists right to say and do whatever they wanna do
3459532 when i heard about it i felt really hurt inside
3459533 i cannot believe a writer could write something like that its the not the way that we want to be portrayed we have feelings we dont like the word retard we are people
3459534 there were parts of the movie where i laughed but it seems to me that the movie tried really hard to go too far and then pull back on everything that was offensive except the issue of people with intellectual disabilities i just think ben stiller and the people involved in this movie just didnt think it was going to be offensive
3459535 no changes or cuts to the film will be made
3459536 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
3459537 rhys why im so gutted that another good one has gone i just cant take it in you are going to be missed so much you were a cracking boy and no one would have a bad word to say about you
3459538 miss you already babe ill never forget you r i p rhys and keep smiling
3459539 rhys is go 2 rip up benidorm on the 14th ye baby
3459540 i cant get over it rhys whatever the problem was it would have gone in time i wish it was a dream and ill wake up and youre still here
3459541 it was a pleasure to know such a kind and helpful person like you i will never forget you butt if you only knew how much you were loved by everyone im sure you wouldnt have done this
3459542 we can confirm the sudden death of a 23 year old man from the bettws area of bridgend police were called to the address in the bettws area at around 11 54am on saturday august 9 2008
3459543 there are no suspicious circumstances and an investigation is being carried out on behalf of the coroner the death is not believed to be linked to any other recent sudden deaths in the area
3459544 we would appeal to the media to report this tragic incident sensitively to minimise the impact on family friends and other vulnerable persons
3459545 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
3459546 up until now people thought that the tasmanian mega fauna had actually gone extinct before people arrived on the island
3459547 things were very climatically stable in that part of australia and yet the mega fauna still managed to go extinct
3459548 so its down to humans of one sort or another
3459549 a lot of people still have in their minds an axe wielding spear wielding people bloodthirsty out there slaughtering all over the place it wasnt like that at all
3459550 it was basically just one joey baby kangaroo in the pot for christmas and thats all youve got to go to do to drive slow breeding species to extinction
3459551 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3459552 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3459553 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3459554 a lot of horn pads a muted horn sound i had it in my head and i kept blocking out chords on the piano but i couldnt seem to get the idea across we ended up putting a pump organ pad underneath with a low cello an upper cello part and the trumpet and it ended up giving the texture i was after
3459555 if you werent born with a tiffany silver spoon in your mouth you can still buy one on ebay
3459556 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3459557 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3459558 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3459559 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3459560 i do think they could have waited a bit if they want a worldwide hit i have them all up here pointing to her beehive i guess they are going for clean cut and boring when i do release mine and i am tempted to do it on the same day this would be the bigger hit
3459561 i do think they could have waited a bit if they want a worldwide hit i have them all up here pointing to her beehive i guess they are going for clean cut and boring when i do release mine and i am tempted to do it on the same day this would be the bigger hit
3459562 im convinced that the national interest demands a new approach to our interaction with the world
3459563 part of it is political parties are a distant analog to families and you really hate to step outside a family environment
3459564 for me the national interest comes before party concerns particularly internationally
3459565 we do need a new direction in american policy and obama has a sense of that
3459566 he recognizes that a long term occupation of iraq is not only expensive its extremely dangerous to the american interests
3459567 he also recognizes that its preferable to speak with potential adversaries rather than simply shun them
3459568 theres a distinction between trumpeting issues and realistically looking at effectiveness
3459569 i have never known a time period where the american brand has been in less repair
3459570 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3459571 we conservatives believe that you dismissed our serious quest for responsible limited government
3459572 in your quest for the presidency we want to know if it is in you to become a passionate and forceful leader with a conservative agenda to fight the lure of socialistic programs promoted by sen barack obama
3459573 its been a good experience for me socially as well as economically
3459574 people are well aware of global warming but it takes the price of gasoline to get them to take that step
3459575 its something they wanted to do anyway but maybe needed a little extra impetus
3459576 people have no choice at one point when the pocketbook is empty
3459577 people are kind of lazy about going beyond just posting a trip
3459578 people who might be asked to stay late can just say im in a carpool and i have to leave at 5
3459579 thats a common excuse to get out of the office on time that carries a decent amount of weight ive been in several meetings where that has happened
3459580 lenovo has engineered a new breed of mobile workstation with the thinkpad w700
3459581 no other pc manufacturer has a mobile workstation that delivers the sheer power performance and cutting edge innovation that lenovo has packed into the thinkpad w700 the thinkpad w700 mobile workstation flat out delivers the command performance our customers demand at the desk as well as in the field
3459582 looks like it really will deliver on developer peter molyneuxs promises
3459583 scapegoating the indian residential schools the noble legacy of hundreds of christian missionairies is sacrificed to political correctness
3459584 expose d first nations people to hatred or contempt on the basis of their race or ancestry
3459585 an apology damages and an order that the respondents attend education sessions about human rights in alberta
3459586 as i write this russia is waging war on my country
3459587 it has no other purpose but to make you laugh and also to play all those records that charted between 66 and 67 it was a pretty good period weve got the beatles and the rolling stones and diana ross and all kinds of people
3459588 at the time if you could get a boat three miles outside of territory waters it was legal to pump in all the new rock and roll into england you couldnt find it anywhere else 22 million kids everyday tuned into radio caroline and radio london and these pirates they were called pirate radio stations and they were arrested by the government and chased across the seas
3459589 it was a big deal and i remember it when i was a kid

3459596 took nearly 68 000 from former washington lobbyist jack abramoff
3459597 senator mccain knows exactly how ralph reed helped jack abramoff defraud indian tribes out of tens of millions of dollars
3459598 senator mccain should spare himself any further embarrassment by canceling this event immediately whose help will he accept next tom delays
3459599 i suggest they take a closer look at barack obamas friends like convicted felon tony rezko or his national co chairman harry reid who took nearly 68 000 from abramoff
3459600 you are housed in block q this is block r
3459601 i am delighted to know that after a long period of 15 years you have triumphed over the despair of rheumatoid arthritis and are showing encouraging signs of recovery with this resilience and spirit i am sure that the day isnt far when you will be able to walk again and come to meet me at rashtrapati bhavan periods of adversity in life are testing times for us do not regret the opportunities you have missed due to your illness you should always look ahead for what you can do for yourself and for others like you who face adversity
3459602 i am moved and grateful that the president wrote to me there are so many people like me yet she has shown such concern towards me i do hope i can walk into rashtrapati bhavan and meet her
3459603 when seema first came to fortis she was bedridden bound to the wheel chair and severely depressed because of the state of her life at such a young age she weighed only 40 kg
3459604 her case was complex because she had multiple joint involvements her bones were severely fragile and her muscles were atomic and weak because she had been immobile for many years it was a very challenging and rare case
3459605 there is a ray of hope for everyone in life no matter how big the problem he or she may be facing a positive attitude can be of immense help
3459606 developers are the driving force behind android applications so without them it would be very hard for android to have a stance in the market
3459607 the android platform has a very strong base and a lot of potential but it also has a lot of competition
3459608 the adc finalists are helping us update the latest version of the sdk before we release it to the world in the coming weeks
3459609 we wanted to limit the challenges developers face with an early release in a particularly critical time during the challenge to not disadvantage them weve separated the scheduled releases to not disadvantage these winners who are competing for money and the public will receive a release of the sdk soon with more documentation and tools
3459610 the idea with open source software is to allow early adopters access to the buggier pieces of code so they can help fix them or let people who want to wait for a solid release the ability to do that
3459611 the key is choice and google has taken away that choice and is developing android like every other piece of closed software
3459612 rather than trying to push yet another platform google ought to be bringing the market together and building applications which is where theyre going to make their money
3459613 the developer discontent is just part of what has turned out to be a flawed strategy
3459614 its the very same reason why apple didnt do third party developers first and thats to assure the process and the program and the quality thats initially being offered
3459615 the community must not forget that google is dealing with partners in the cell phone industry and they certainly have a reputation of a closed source tight lipped mentality
3459616 the community can cry foul if google releases the newest sdk to developers a week before handsets hit the stores but as far as i have heard that is far from the truth
3459617 within the next six months symbian and android will combine into a single open source os
3459618 on the other hand it would be much easier to do now than to tackle it in the future when developers are that much farther down the road
3459619 to tie symbian and android together would require an awful lot of heavy lifting between google and nokia and to do that kind of an agreement would be problematic
3459620 it would have been easier while symbian was small and independent but now that symbian is basically a subsidiary of nokia its going to be pretty difficult
3459621 if you develop for apple youve got a ready market
3459622 if you develop for android its a crapshoot because theres no assurance that the android platform is even going to sell
3459623 while google does simple well this is googles first device as opposed to apple which clearly has been doing devices for a while
3459624 apple is treating developers terribly and really undermining the community
3459625 the fact that applications have to go through the itunes store in order to be distributed really shows how much control apple has over the entire os
3459626 at the end of the day developers want to make money
3459627 so theyre going to develop on a platform and put resources on a platform that will make them money
3459628 undoubtedly some developers have written android off and will never return
3459629 lots arent paying a darn bit of attention to the whole mess because there arent any devices ready yet
3459630 if more columnists dare to question the magisterial beauty of our games we will have no choice but to pull coverage in favor of wall to wall airings of cant stop the music xie xie

3459632 we are a body short but do not forget we have diaby who is not available song who is at the olympics we have nasri and rosicky who were not in amsterdam then theres bischoff as well who is currently injured so we have plenty of players
3459633 we have been hoping that cisco would merge the two channel partner programs into a unified smb partner program that would span products services and support
3459634 a single cisco relationship will definitely mitigate challenges and simplify how we do business with our channel partner community quite simply the whole is more than the sum of the parts for cisco and linksys
3459635 the smb market continues to present tremendous growth potential for cisco and our channel partners and we have been successfully serving the sector with solutions from both cisco and linksys
3459636 we believe that taking a coordinated approach across technology and go to market strategies is a natural evolution that brings greater synergies to our customers and channel partners alike this includes an array of channel program benefits to meet the broad requirements presented by our partners customer base all designed to increase revenue potential and enable us to focus collectively on serving the smb customer

3459652 he wrote a song that works great as a duet
3459653 he played guitar he sang on it he did the harmony parts its perfect its incredibly perfectly tuned
3459654 the theme of the song is running into someone you havent seen in a while and anyway he and i are singing that to one another now on this record
3459655 both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home the great difference is that i intend to win it first
3459656 the surge has succeeded yet commits a grave error by insisting that even in hindsight he would oppose the surge even in retrospect he would chose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
3459657 what is missing is the judgment of a commander in chief
3459658 first he opposed the surge and then he confidently predicted it would fail and then he tried to prevent funding for the troops that carried out the surge
3459659 the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance but could still be squandered by hasty withdrawals or arbitrary timelines

3459662 they helped us with our field testing and were proud to be supplying them with transtars the addition of the maxxforce engine is the next step in providing great products for our great customers
3459663 were very happy with what weve been seeing with results
3459664 were a very weight conscious company and with the new maxxforce engine we probably are about 325 to 350 pounds lighter than we were with the engine we were using before
3459665 the next chapter in providing integrated solutions for select heavy trucks and big bore engines begins today
3459666 maxxforce big bore engines are now officially in the market
3459667 fuel economy improvements of 30 to 50 are achievable in refuse applications like the one this truck is built to handle reduced fuel consumption also directly reduces co2 emissions which is good for the environment and society as a whole
3459668 there are more than 80 000 vehicles in refuse service in the u s with each running up to 75 000 miles a year
3459669 at that many miles a hybrid refuse truck would use 10 000 gallons less diesel per year than a conventional truck hybrid trucks are also quieter than conventional trucks meaning less noise in our neighborhoods on trash collection days
3459670 with the cost of diesel fuel now averaging almost 5 per gallon we believe this message will truly resonate with truckers who pay more than 1 000 per fill up and travel 100 000 miles or more each year
3459671 michelin x one tires provide an excellent means to improve a trucks operating efficiency not only does this save the trucking company green on their bottom line but it also saves the environment green by reducing fuel consumption and co2 emissions
3459672 we are very excited that we have been able to expand the museum
3459673 we conservatives believe that you dismissed our serious quest for responsible limited government
3459674 in your quest for the presidency we want to know if it is in you to become a passionate and forceful leader with a conservative agenda to fight the lure of socialistic programs promoted by sen barack obama
3459675 sure sweetie you can be a broadway star but if youre not pretty enough someone else will sing your role
3459676 of course honey go write a novel but just know that someone else with a smaller butt will be out there to do the book tour
3459677 thats kind of the finishing unit for gas at the plant its kind of like running a doughnut factory without a deep fryer we just cant produce product right now
3459678 our customers will likely notice some of our sites will run out of gasoline temporarily gasoline is still being delivered but there will be for petro canada customers an inconvenience factor
3459679 the gasoline will be available at other petro canada sites it just might not be available where you normally fill up
3459680 wed rather just be putting gasoline in the ground and letting our customers fill up their tanks but were in a situation where we dont have the volume of gasoline that we normally do
3459681 were getting our hands on any trucks we can to source product internationally and locally

3459688 what do you do when the biggest country in the world wants to pound your city
3459689 i think its very clear we didnt come to a final recommendation but this reflects what we did so far
3459690 one of the goals of the composition of the committee was to get them to buy in on changes we havent been able to do that
3459691 we try to be a hothouse for creative and new works at the acorn and we try to bring a big world to a small town
3459692 people dont expect to find this kind of big city culture in the middle of a corn field
3459693 we try to vary what we do so people can come over and over and not get bored
3459694 we wanted to create a sanctuary for the arts a place where artists of all kinds would have a unique platform to express ideas to an appreciative audience
3459695 many of our performers tell us this is their favorite place to play

3459699 what i get irritated about is they have tournaments on mothers or fathers day
3459700 i may sound crazy saying im doing this so my son can play high school ball and then college ball and maybe move on from there but were devoted to our kids
3459701 not only are kids getting into it earlier but theres a huge market with pitching hitting speed and agility lessons and everybodys swinging a worth prodigy lithium bat that costs 200
3459702 in the last 10 years or so we have seen a noticeable difference in the number of younger kids 8 and 9 years old playing travel ball
3459703 i guarantee you i spent 15 000 hotels gas food all kinds of things ive got 1 000 in bats but i love it
3459704 to a certain extent its been going on quite some time but it is getting younger and younger and im not so sure thats good
3459705 there is no way you can protect those kids arms
3459706 my guess is its going to pay to be patient at this point especially with the developments weve seen on the energy side where at least from my perception some of the concerns about inflation and some inflation expectations seem to have diminished
3459707 overall downside risks to growth prevail in particular risks stem from the dampening impact on consumption and investment of further unanticipated increases in energy and food prices moreover downside risks continue to relate to the potential for the financial market tensions to affect the real economy more adversely than currently anticipated
3459708 dont talk to me leave me alone your the reason all the crack heads moved into this neighborhood
3459709 you leave us the beeeeeeep alone and we will continue to leave you alone
3459710 dont talk to me leave me alone your the reason all the crack heads moved into this neighborhood
3459711 you leave us the beeeeeeep alone and we will continue to leave you alone
3459712 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
3459713 i think our bigger fear was that we didnt want to offend any religious people but looking at the discussion that unfolded from this thing what we had was a good sizeable group of players that we might call militant atheists and the rest of the players seemed very tolerant including all of the religious players
3459714 i didnt expect to hit hot buttons on the atheist side as much i expected it on the religious side
3459715 but so far ive had no critical feedback at all from anybody who is religious feeling that we were misrepresenting religion or it was bad to represent religion in the game it was really the atheists
3459716 we have a number of team members that are pretty religious
3459717 and so in design on the team in our small little microcosm of players out there we tried our best to make sure we werent overtly offending any religious people but yet we wanted to include the idea the concept of religion in the game
3459718 we didnt want to go too far down that path we leave the whole creation of the universe question open
3459719 obviously as the player youre coming in and playing something like a god directing the evolution of a species but we never really state who you the player are

3459722 linking hiv and reproductive choice reflecting on strategies for advocacy
3459723 unwanted pregnancy among positive women is a reality that hardly is discussed the workshop that i attended was one of the few spaces in the conference where abortion as an option was addressed it was disappointing to see so many participants leave the workshop just as we broke into small groups to strategize how to disseminate messages about positive womens reproductive rights the topic of abortion seemed to make many people uncomfortable so much so that they had to leave the session

3459732 insulting at best and at worst slandered some very accomplished canadians

3459736 the territory of israel represents a significant market for asi and our products we are looking forward to working with mr barak to introduce our remarkable line of products such as tankskin and aztik armor 100 to the israeli marketplace
3459737 i am excited about the opportunity to introduce asis products such as tankskin and aztik armor to israel because they will have a significant impact in the protection of idf soldiers and israeli law enforcement as well as the overall security of israel additionally i am excited to work with the asi team many of whom have personal experience fighting in the contemporary 360 degree asymmetrical battlefield that idf soldiers are confronted with on a daily basis asi has an intimate understanding of the battleground realities and is crafting solutions that will protect israels warriors
3459738 mr barak will be a tremendous addition to the asi distribution and marketing network his geographic military and industry expertise in israel coupled with his passion to provide armor and ballistic solutions that will have a substantial impact in the overall security of idf soldiers and israeli police will help asi to gain a strategic foothold in the region we are truly fortunate to have mr barak join our team

3459743 no citizen or company should be forced or encouraged to choose a closed technology over an open one through a government having made that choice first
3459744 i know a smart business decision when i see one choosing open standards is a very smart business decision indeed
3459745 we need an approach to standards that is based on evidence on economics and on experience it is simplistic to assume that because some intellectual property protection is good that such protection should therefore be absolute in all circumstances it is simplistic to assume that because standardisation sometimes brings benefits more standardisation will bring more benefits it is simplistic to assume that if the best approach is sometimes to base a standard on proprietary technology then that is always the best approach and it is simplistic to assume that we can fix on a standard today without paying attention to the risk of being locked in tomorrow

3459764 target and borders and best buy are preventing small boutique shops that never existing from opening up in that new suburb
3459765 the point about walmart is that it employs people full time who cannot live anything other than the most basic existence on the wages they pay
3459766 can someone point to a unionized company that is successfully competing with non unionized companies
3459767 if walmart paid more they would get different employees the real quetion is how to make the alternatives to a walmart job good enough and plentaful enough that walmart has to pay more
3459768 its like these people want a nation of proles a nation of people who never get off or even want to get off the bottom rung of the economic ladder
3459769 the point about walmart is that it employs people full time who cannot live anything other than the most basic existence on the wages they pay
3459770 we cannot drive the winds but we can set our sails

3459772 when you teach you deal with concepts and ideas when you worship you deal with a person
3459773 john the baptist was called the greatest in the kingdom not because of signs and wonders but because he simply pointed to christ the greatest pastors worship leaders and preachers of the church will be the ones who simply pointed to christ
3459774 change is about circumstances but transition deals with your attitude in response to the change change is inevitable because god is a god of progression

3459799 fake it until you make it if you have to but i am actually recommending a genuine paradigm shift in consciousness when you would really rather masturbate than have sex with a woman who doesnt want to be with you as much as you want to be with her you will have a transcendent experience every time you make love with someone

3459801 there have been many challenges but the greatest one is probably trying to get to know the strengths and weaknesses of the organization both on and off the ice this takes time and being around the people on a daily basis i believe any strong organization starts with good people in the right places and now that i have spent a full year here i feel that i have a better handle on our strengths and weaknesses
3459802 we have all seen devastating pictures of abuse starvation homeless effects of war but never have been unified with music in a way until now that reaches the listeners core level creating feelings that pictures alone cant and that allows for the proper contribution
3459803 to unite people across the globe with music to take action to create a better world so future generations will have a planet worth inheriting

3459812 we continue to believe that our australian businesses will continue to perform well and obviously weve got some issues on the macro side in new zealand

3459817 telstra has traditionally won a lot of customer share by virtue of being the only one who could offer large scale coverage
3459818 in regional areas where telstras share is often 50 per cent plus compared to their national share of 40 to 42 per cent then that clearly offers an opportunity to us to make some inroads

3459822 these large companies sap microsoft and oracle arent going any where per your point they have massive installed base with massive recurring revenue streams
3459823 the fact that ibm sap oracle and microsoft have yet to establish infrastructures that allow them to credibly include the full gamut of social software doesnt mean they wont or cant all the above vendors are looking closely at social software and endeavoring to figure out where and how these technologies can be sensibly used among their customers these vendors are not going to play fast and loose with their millions of users or billions of revenue they collect each year theyre going to get it right with purpose
3459824 a call center agent at an insurance company might receive a call from someone who wants to insure a diamond ring the agent collects basic information about the potential customer and enters it into an sap based insurance underwriting application through a presence client integrated with the application the call center agent will then be able to see a list of the companys insurance underwriters inside your underwriting application you see a list of eight people and one of them has a green button next to their name so you click there then through an immediate instant messaging session or a phone call the agent goes over the basics of the prospect with the underwriter to determine whether the company will insure the ring you get back a real time answer yes or no to the business it looks like an incremental improvement in business process speed to the customer it looks like a whole new process instead of sending your stuff in and waiting three weeks for the insurance company to come back to you and say youre covered you get it done in one call thats all because you exposed the presence of the people who are able to say yea or nay on underwriting inside your underwriting application

3459828 firms with 1000 employees or more will spend 764 million on web 2 0 tools and technologies over the next five years that expenditure will grow at a compound annual rate of 43 the top spending category will be social networking tools
3459829 it departments will take their heads out of the sand and embrace web 2 0 technologies and we can expect to see at least half of the 42 of enterprises that say web 2 0 is not on their priority list add it by years end
3459830 cios concede that they cannot quell passionate employees use of consumer oriented or saas web 2 0 tools and will choose to mitigate risk by deploying enterprise class tools in their stead
3459831 the fastest growing new commercial software product in ibm history
3459832 what this means is that much of the web 2 0 tool kit will simply fade into the fabric of enterprise collaboration suite by 2013 few buyers will seek out and purchase
3459833 before being a buyer or seller of products and services an organization is a participant in a complex network of market and stakeholder relationships e g employees customers partners and suppliers that have greater influence over its long term success than does its products or services the informal networks and social relationships that permeate a workforce have greater influence over an organizations long term success than does its managerial practices

3459838 if we scan our inner self we will find a hunger a yearning a need for a kind of love that will consume us with total fulfillment and for a complete security that nothing in this world can give neither money nor health nor any amount of intellectual understanding
3459839 we are fulfilling our agreement with the georgian government that in an emergency we would assist them in redeploying their troops

3459853 id go id probably go like milan or something like that where i grew up or something like that peace out do you know any reasonable person that would turn down 50 million dollars because i grew up in italy it has more significance to me because im more familiar with it ive been there and i still have friends there im thinking about buying a house out there it would be nothing to me to be able to do that
3459854 if someone wants to throw 50 million on the table for me we can talk
3459855 they throw 30 40 50 million a year at me i cant turn that down i think right now its very exciting theyre starting a new buzz you start to do a little research and they got money over there you stay in the states you make the max you make 18 million take out taxes and you have 9 10 you have an opportunity to go somewhere and make 25 30 tax free we might have to pack our bags
3459856 it would definitely be something id consider you can never say never to anything the olympics have shown how this game has grown its not just the united states game anymore its the worlds game
3459857 as a businessman i would have to consider it if my wife was down and the money was right
3459858 from a business standpoint you have to at least listen to every offer
3459859 youre right only cska dynamo and khimki are the teams with huge money in europe along with olympiakos and panathinaikos from greece so if we are talking about lebron or kobe or any other superstar it all comes down to these five teams bc triumph formerly dynamo moscow region surprised everybody by signing krstic to a three million euro per year deal but its their only big buy so far and nobody knows what will happen next i think it is possible that one of these teams will find the money for an nba superstar yet 50 million is still outlandish were not talking about going roughly from 25 million team payroll to 32 million as was the case with childress but going from 25 million to 75 million it would make a little more sense if we were talking about what would be a 50 million a year nba contract which would equal about 17 million euros per year im sure that teams are preparing for talks and nobody is actually ready to just throw out 50 million now anyway its hard to predict anything because this will be an unprecedented move that will change the way we think now about sports contracts cska used to be the team paying crazy salaries compared to other teams in europe but for the last several seasons they have been coached by ettore messina and instead of chasing big names they try to get players that will fit the system this season when everyone is signing superstars the biggest names cska got are zoran planinic and erazem lorbek they are not the team that puts all their eggs in one basket messina is only signed until next summer though so well see what happens also cska has the most success in terms of public relations is well known everywhere in the world and they may be ready to spend to make the next step in these terms if youre nike youd want your player to be in moscow which is one of the world capitals playing for a well known team khimki have been big spenders for several years and this summer they went over the top the reason for that is they are hoping to get a contract with euroleague next summer when it could become a closed league it was announced that euroleague will look at marketability of the teams so khimki signed not just quality players but well known players from nba teams and successful national teams in carlos delfino and jorge garbajosa they went for the biggest names they thought they could target each player received what would be a 9 million a year nba contract the euroleague contract talks will continue next summer and if khimki are desperate to sign the deal they will have to spend crazy money actually if i were the euroleague i would quietly put pressure on the team and say you get lebron and well sign you to a euroleague contract on the other hand this is a smaller city in moscow region dynamo has a reputation of an underarchieving team here in russia they spend cska like money on their roster yet the results are very different this year they finally got a great coach in david blatt and also signed bostjan nachbar to what would be again a 9 million nba contract they are rumored to be targeting ben gordon now that its known that players of this caliber are available for the right money once again its impossible to tell how far the team can go in terms of spending because whats happening now is unprecedented for years dynamo has been the richest team that is not in the euroleague and they are desperate to get in the league still it is not surprising that it was a greek team which was the first to hand out a huge contract their owners have the most freedom to act because they are just that owners one person for each team russian teams have to find sponsors for each deal either from businesses or local governments which takes time and pursuasion sic if a greek owner feels like spending it will take him a second to give a go ahead to team management eccentric billionaire fan owners is not what russia is about
3459860 even more enticing to james has to be the revelation that earl boykins recently signed contract with italys virtus bologna includes income from bolognas sponsorship and marketing arms due to the nbas collective bargaining agreement this sort of arrangement is off limits in the nba but its exactly what lebron james inc is looking for james is right he wont become a billionaire by playing basketball so he and his management team have begun to look for more than endorsement dollars theyre now interested in equity stakes in the companies lebron lends his name to what if the owners of cska moscow or olympiacos the two teams reported to have contacted james offered him equity stakes in the teams and or outside business ventures they accumulated their billions in in addition to his playing salary an equity stake in a billion dollar business would pay dividends long after james called it quits on the hardwood and it would inch james closer to his stated goal of becoming the richest man in the world if the nbas collective bargaining agreement allowed it you can bet that james would negotiate an ownership percentage in the cavs or the soon to be brooklyn nets or the new york knicks any discussions between james and olympiacos or cska moscow will begin with what the euroleague can offer that the nba cannot
3459861 i wonder if the nba will be forced to adopt an mls style
3459862 european teams have rules that limit the number of non european teams that can be on their roster
3459863 but seriously cleveland cant pay 50 million for lebron nor should any american team pay that
3459864 cleveland shouldnt pay nor should any american team yadda yadda
3459865 there were a number of errors of law in the decision which led to the erroneous conclusion dismissing the complaint in the action
3459866 those errors include the failure of the court to recognize that the prime purpose of the trademark act is to protect consumers and trademark owners there was no weight given to that well established principle
3459867 certainly tiffany met its duty to police its trademark by suing ebay
3459868 were not aware of any additional obligation tiffany has to assist ebay which has its own independent obligations under the law once ebay has notice of a substantial problem it has a duty to investigate and take action
3459869 the risk of buying counterfeit items is higher in an internet setting when the goods are not in front of the buyer and the seller is unknown
3459870 while the internet has facilitated the sale of lots of merchandise in a very positive way when fraudsters get involved theres a risk that they can damage the buyer and the legitimate seller
3459871 tiffanys decision to carry this litigation on after the district courts decision doesnt do anything to combat counterfeiting

3459995 an erroneous principle than which scarce any has proved more mischievous to the present glorious work of god is a notion that it is gods manner in these days to guide his saints by inspiration or immediate revelation as long as a person has a notion that he is guided by immediate direction from heaven it makes him incorrigible and impregnable in all his misconduct many godly persons have undoubtedly in this and other ages exposed themselves to woeful delusions by an aptness to lay too much weight on impulses and impressions as if they were immediate revelations from god to signify something future or to direct them where to go and what to do i would therefore entreat the people of god to be very cautious how they give heed to such things i have seen them fail in very many instances and know by experience that impressions being made with great power and upon the minds of true yea eminent saints are no sure signs of their being revelations from heaven i have known such impressions fail in some instances attended with all these circumstances
3459996 for we did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our lord jesus christ but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty

3459999 by this term he means in my opinion not those who were endowed with the gift of prophesying but those who were endowed with a peculiar gift not merely for interpreting scripture but also for applying it wisely for present use my reason for thinking so is this that he prefers prophecy to all other gifts on the ground of its yielding more edification a commendation that would not be applicable to the predicting of future events farther when he describes the office of prophet or at least treats of what he ought principally to do he says that he must devote himself to consolation exhortation and doctrine now these are things that are distinct from prophesyings let us then by prophets in this passage understand first of all eminent interpreters of scripture and farther persons who are endowed with no common wisdom and dexterity in taking a right view of the present necessity of the church that they may speak suitably to it and in this way be in a manner ambassadors to communicate the divine will between them and teachers this difference may be pointed out that the office of teacher consists in taking care that sound doctrines be maintained and propagated in order that the purity of religion may be kept up in the church at the same time even this term is taken in different senses and here perhaps it is used rather in the sense of pastor unless you prefer it may be to take it in a general way for all that are endowed with the gift of teaching as in acts 13 1 where also luke conjoins them with prophets my reason for not agreeing with those who make the whole of the office of prophet consist in the interpretation of scripture is this that paul restricts the number of those who ought to speak to two or three 1 corinthians 14 29 which would not accord with a bare interpretation of scripture in fine my opinion is this that the prophets here spoken of are those who make known the will of god by applying with dexterity and skill prophecies threatenings promises and the whole doctrine of scripture to the present use of the church if any one is of a different opinion i have no objection to his being so and will not raise any quarrel on that account for it is difficult to form a judgment as to gifts and offices of which the church has been so long deprived excepting only that there are some traces or shadows of them still to be seen
