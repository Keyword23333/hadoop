3720104 with the anticipation of the new stadium nearing this will be a tremendous environment for our players and staff since becoming the midwest league affiliate of the padres in 1999 the wizards have compiled a 652 712 478 record over parts of 10 seasons including a 62 58 517 overall mark in 2008 the wizards have advanced to the playoffs five times during that span additionally the sports business journal ranked fort wayne as the 1 minor league city in a 2007 poll and the wizards will move into their new home in downtown fort wayne harrison square ballpark in 2009 current padres who have played for the wizards include right handed pitcher jake peavy 2000 catchers luke carlin 2003 04 and nick hundley 2005 06 and outfielder chase headley 2005 i am excited that we will continue our relationship with fort wayne and am proud that the padres will be the organization that opens the wizards new downtown ballpark
3720105 none of this would have been possible without the efforts of mike nutter and his staff and i hope to bring a midwest league championship to fort wayne soon

3720133 a triple whammy of cracking down on would be dumpers quicker clearing up by councils and soaring metal prices are helping to win the battle against unsightly old bangers being left on our streets
3720134 a few years ago youd have had to pay someone to take your old car away but now scrap metal dealers will pay you up to 1 000 for the pleasure this has helped the situation but councils are also playing an important role theyve listened to the concerns of local people and reacted accordingly
3720135 i thought poetry could change everything could change history and could humanize and i think that the illusion is very necessary to push poets to be involved and to believe but now i think that poetry changes only the poet

3720141 smoothed analysis of algorithms why the simplex algorithm usually takes polynomial time
3720142 the iocs position is clear the media must be free to report on the olympic games
3720143 this is china turning on its hospitality and welcoming people and it isnt just journalists getting the red carpet treatment
3720144 on the substantive issues there hasnt been much movement at all
3720145 the one human rights pledge that china made was that there would be a free media for the games and that just hasnt materialized
3720146 i can give you a general principle that is the chinese government adopts a positive and open attitude and welcomes foreign journalists coming to china and report on the beijing olympics
3720147 i think a drop of 20 percent is a bit over done
3720148 weve fallen too far too fast i expect the market to sit between 110 and 120 in the short term

3720169 its possible they could move it to the york hall micky could sell 400 or 500 tickets with his following whereas norton would struggle to sell 100 even in wolverhampton

3720177 woi shubuh oey adzan baru lewat kalo gak buru buru bisa ketinggalan berjamaan di masjid
3720178 i want to be quick quick in terms of our passing getting to the halfway line and penning teams in so the passing becomes shorter
3720179 if we can get on top of teams especially at upton park then with the pace weve got in the squad well unlock the doors i want to have that facility
3720180 youve got to have pace in the side and thats what ive tried to bring in players who can play in tight areas have got explosive pace and can make a difference when it comes to finishing
3720181 ive spent all my career being 40 1 and it wont make any difference to me
3720182 you win a couple and things change then you lose a couple we know that i dont go on the websites and listen to the local radio phone ins like most managers dont but i know whats going on out there and its made me even more determined to be successful
3720183 im surrounded by it and ive been a bit disappointed
3720184 a couple of times last year there was no realism in what was happening and what our problems were being a west ham fan i understand what the responsibilities are and i dont have a problem with that
3720185 if i can say anything its get behind them because the west ham fans dont realise what a difference it makes we pride ourselves on the atmosphere and the way we support our club
3720186 when we come out for the handshakes and bubbles is sung they dont realise what it does to the opposition as well what weve been saying to the players is lets get this thing going
3720187 you need to get there gradually because trying to do it quickly like leeds you may end up in bother you need to do it gradually like everton
3720188 but you still need one of those top four to fall out of it thats the big thing
3720189 i think our ratio was one fitness specialist to nine or 10 players weve greatly reduced that so there shouldnt be a situation where any of them are hanging around waiting for treatment
3720190 the players are high maintenance they demand people around them so they have everything there to improve as a player and stay fit so we have gone along with that
3720191 i am on a saturday when you walk into the ground and its game on loads of things go into it at the end of the day driving home you get the enjoyment from having seen people perform like seeing james tomkins come through

3720264 one of the pakeha made a comment about how were bending over backwards for maori and how maori have all this privilege and i thought i was going to have to get up and put him right and all these pakehas started standing up and telling him what the real deal was and i thought here we have a situation where the maori dont have to fight their own call all the time and youve actually got pakeha whore educated on te tiriti and i thought give these guys a go and theyre actually a great party to work with
3720265 some are reasonable they certainly have suffered from such a long time standing in the ground some had actually fallen over so also had a bit of decay damage round the bases as well so whilst they can be put back theres still a lot of work in terms of stabilising them and making them sound enough to survive another 100 years
3720266 the speech he gave the other day and the policy he released is pretty well identical to the one brash gave three years ago in other words theyre rerunning exactly the same tricks aimed at the same people and its not because they think that 30 or 40 000 people on the dpb have to be pushed into jobs to help the economy ands save the country from welfare dependency its just a nice easy way to grab those central votes by getting people angry and against somebody and feeling indignant

3720331 during the campaign 174 officers visited 2779 employers across the country and found 950 children working
3720332 399 of these children were being employed illegally without the necessary work permits with 16 children working in prohibited occupations and 101 others working in wrong or excess of the hours allowed
3720333 all the employers were given advice and guidance on the regulations
3720334 we will be re visiting 343 of these employers in the near future to check they have acted on the advice they were given and have issued employment permits and cards
3720335 the results of child employment week clearly show the need for a national campaign to highlight the importance of complying with the legislation and further educate ill informed employers and parents of the legal requirements to ensure that all children are safe and protected when working

3720340 there are two sides to todays figures the welcome news is that the numbers on incapacity benefits and lone parent benefit continue to fall as our reforms kick in and more people who were written off before now having the chance to join the high numbers in work
3720341 the disappointing news is the increase in unemployment but there is considerable help available to people through jobcentre plus there are over 600 000 vacancies available at the moment

3720350 with hunger on the rise we are doing our best to stream incoming contributions to the people most in need in africa asia and the caribbean
3720351 it is essential to launch a bold new set of responses to stem a full blown hunger and nutritional crisis

3720353 our action plan is targeted and customized to help the most vulnerable meet their urgent needs
3720354 whilst all eyes are on the price wars between the big four supermarkets there is a strong case for using an often overlooked alternative that has been in place long before the term supermarket ever existed
3720355 im of course referring to markets that are in nearly every town and city in the uk and have consistently offered a number of benefits to shoppers since they began
3720356 we have carried out research at a number of sites in the uk and compared those with the prices shown by the leading supermarkets
3720357 based on a list of goods found in most shopping baskets the price variation has been quite frankly astounding
3720358 in some cases the shopping basket at a market was 20 percent cheaper than one of the leading high street supermarkets who in this particular case is known for good value this saving not only reverses the effects of the last 12 months food inflation but actually offers a further saving beyond the increases
3720359 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
3720360 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
3720361 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
3720362 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
3720363 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal
3720364 if something were half human and half animal what would our moral responsibilities be it might be immoral to kill such a creature its wrong to create creatures whose moral stature we are perplexed about

3720367 the six procurement hubs recognised that their requirements for it equipment were common it made sense therefore to take full advantage of this excellent opportunity to collaborate
3720368 ogcbuying solutions was brought in at an early stage and helped to facilitate the collaboration and assisted with the procurement nhs connecting for health were approached to input into the technical aspects of the procurement and to ensure alignment with the nhs national programme for it
3720369 from the outset the hubs were keen to work together to aggregate their volumes and to apply their joint buying power in the marketplace
3720370 buying solutions provided the facilitation and project management for the procurement as well as advice and guidance but without doubt the hard work was done by the hubs themselves
3720371 this has laid the foundations for future collaborative work between the nhs ogcbuying solutions and the wider public sector
3720372 this project involving the procurement of 52 000 desktops and 8 500 laptops has enabled us to build on the successes of individual hubs to share expertise and to achieve a great deal for our nhs trusts
3720373 collaboration is nothing new to the cphs however a collaboration exercise of this scale consisting of a team of individuals from six different regional organisations representing 220 nhs trusts was a significant challenge we all recognised we have been able to put aside local agendas in order to successfully construct a deal with our suppliers and deliver real benefit to the nhs
3720374 we are sending out a clear message to the market that nhs regions are working together to get the best possible deals
3720375 i congratulate pupils and teachers for all their hard work this year
3720376 key stage 3 is an important stepping stone to success at further study and life beyond the classroom it is encouraging that most pupils are achieving at or above the expected standard for their age in all three subjects and almost a third are now achieving the highest levels in maths
3720377 but i am disappointed by the slight drops in english and science reversing the rises of last year we know there is more to do before all of our schools are truly world class and that every young person is reaching their full potential at age 14 and beyond
3720378 the reforms we set out in the childrens plan will accelerate the pace of improvement we are giving schools the tools they need massive investment in support for teachers more support for childrens wider needs and the new secondary curriculum starting next month which will give them real flexibility over how they teach and the confidence to intervene earlier to give support to the right children at the right time in the right way
3720379 todays figures show that secondary school teachers have rightly been focussing on improving young peoples writing skills
3720380 we know there are always risks of childrens learning stalling when they move from primary to secondary school as some struggle to adapt to a fuller curriculum or dont feel emotionally or socially ready for a bigger school
3720381 we saw last week that 11 year olds are leaving primary school as confident readers but too many are behind in writing
3720382 we know that as children get older their interest in books can wane as they gain more independence and are surrounded by more distractions such as the internet television and socialising with friends this is despite more excellent new fiction for teenagers
3720383 it is essential to teenagers academic progress that they continue to read for pleasure outside school
3720384 parents have a vital role to play reading and talking about stories together as children move towards secondary school and encouraging them to read everything from novels to magazines as they get older this will give children real confidence and will help reading to be as much apart of their lives as going to the shops or meeting their friends

3720539 in the end we are not in an auction a market or a bazaar we will not barter our right for another of our rights we will not barter jerusalem for the refugees or the refugees for the security issue or the security for the borders issue all these are our rights it is for their sake that we entered the peace process on the basis of international law of israels withdrawal to the 1967 borders of establishing a palestinian state with east jerusalem as its capital and solving the final issues including that of the refugees in accordance with the resolutions of international legitimacy these are the bases on which we entered into the peace process
3720540 and to them i say that it was possible to reach an agreement during the first months of 1994 but on israels conditions i mean by this that i do not want time to be a sword hanging over our necks pushing us into accepting all the israeli conditions
3720541 this is an israeli attempt to exploit the internal palestinian situations we have a wound called the hamas coup in the gaza strip and he olmert is holding this wound and using it as a sword against us yes we know there is a palestinian wound but will not let it be exploited to blackmail us and fight our constants if hamas acted stupidly then i will not let israel get the price for this stupidity
3720542 there is a misunderstanding we have no objection to exchanging territories that are equal in value and fungibles but the exchange on this basis is done after israels recognition of the 1967 borders and then there can be talk about exchanging territories in accordance with the two concerned countries interests this is possible between neighboring countries and it happened between iraq and jordan ecuador and peru and so on in other words it does not have the right to talk about appropriating 7 percent before withdrawal this is unacceptable
3720543 this is our position and we explained it in our official response and conveyed it to the americans and europeans we told the israelis your leak today is absolutely impermissible and inappropriate because it is half truths they rely in their leaks on the idea that the arabs derive their information from the israeli media
3720544 truth is truebombefan real backbone would require you do vote for obama

3720560 im convinced that the national interest demands a new approach to our interaction with the world
3720561 part of it is political parties are a distant analog to families and you really hate to step outside a family environment
3720562 a single endorsement does not hide the fact that sen obama has no record of achievement beyond the confines of his party
3720563 while john mccain has spent his career putting the country first ahead of personal and party interests sen obamas record is a lesson in partisanship
3720564 for me the national interest comes before party concerns particularly internationally
3720565 we do need a new direction in american policy and obama has a sense of that
3720566 he recognizes that a long term occupation of iraq is not only expensive its extremely dangerous to the american interests
3720567 he also recognizes that its preferable to speak with potential adversaries rather than simply shun them

3720572 you have to wonder when they look at what they consider a loophole with such excitement
3720573 that would suggest manipulating the process and i think opens the door to suspicion
3720574 the prospect of someone coming in with no id and registering and voting is contrary to every sort of protection that legislators and lawmakers have built into this system for decades
3720575 the processes and the law and the systems in our 88 counties are not equipped to handle same day registration
3720576 this is one of many ways well be encouraging our supporters to skip the lines on election day and make sure their vote is cast early
3720577 instructions are being developed and being sent to boards of election across the state to make sure voting is consistent
3720578 there is no question that the huge effort to register and turn out voters at ohio state university is going to have a positive impact on our race
3720579 its a great moment of spontaneity and political manipulation all in one
3720580 bryan had a big opportunity but he missed it because he was afraid of losing his base

3720591 some early life exposures such as maternal smoking during pregnancy or personal characteristics may impair the development of physical control and coordination as well as increasing the risk of obesity in later life
3720592 rather than being explained by a single factor an accumulation throughout life of many associated cultural personal and economic exposures is likely to underlie the risks for obesity and some elements of associated neurological function

3720605 i originally wanted to be a commercial artist but ended up doing a number of other jobs like working for the chicago northwestern railroad painting houses stringing barbed wire fence welding and working in a chicken house and a grain elevator ive delivered everything from vulcan ovens to lobstertails when i drove for institutional foods and just so i could get a free ski season pass i even took a job as maid housekeeper in breckenridge
3720606 wow i really want to run my hands through peoples hair
3720607 this isnt too different than drawing a picture only you do it with a pair of scissors i was all thumbs when i first started but ive really improved
3720608 this is really a great career but you have to be a people person give clients a pleasant place to come earn their trust and be someone they like if youre good at it there can be a lot of benefits
3720609 its tough when people cancel appointments at the last minute because its hard to fill that spot like i said before if you dont work you dont get paid the slow times of the year can be a bit frustrating and its difficult when you have clients you really like and they move out of town on job transfers etc its usually the good ones who move
3720610 no youre one of my best clients and id hate to see you go
3720611 could someones cell phone ring tone keep them from getting a job interview
3720612 what kind of song did he use for a ring tone
3720613 but they should hire me for who i am not because of some song after all my choice of music has nothing to do with the kind of work im capable of
3720614 why cant i just wallow in my misery for a few weeks take a vacation get drunk relax and live off that generous severance package they gave me
3720615 who would you recommend i speak with in the xyz field or in xyz occupation or company
3720616 im an introvert how do i network without alientating friends and family how do i sell myself without seeming pushy how can i be clear about what im going after without taking a ton of their time and pressing their patience
3720617 by virtue of removing x you place value on whats left behind
3720618 who do you think youre kidding you havent been here long enough earned your stripes or paid your dues
3720619 they might have picked you if youd hung out with the right people including the all seeing and all powerful career development committee
3720620 you dont look the part eat the right food or wear the right clothes why you dont even own one pair of those skinny little black framed glasses
3720621 im so sorry i never ever thought you would regret it
3720622 because 6 months ago you were the one convincing me that love exists
3720623 if youre the head coach and youre top receiver hasnt practiced yet yes youre concerned but were also looking at it optimistically because we proved the other night that we have some young guys who are capable of playing and were thrilled with that he hasnt exactly been the go to receiver in the preseason around here
3720624 we rested him last year and im still resting him
3720625 1 6 for instance if the maxversion tag has a value of 1 0 we will replace it with 1 6
3720626 the new latitude laptops and dell precision mobile workstations represent the largest client product development effort in the history of dell
3720627 weve invested more than one million engineering hours and the result is a family of head turning products that are as solid on the inside as on the outside with features that enable better security manageability and productivity
3720628 dont drink that beer come frolick and jump and play in the woods with me
3720629 dont eat those shrooms dear old friend mr deer come folick and jump and dance and play in the fields with the turtle and me
3720630 cest pour manger uniquement donc pas avant le d ner
3720631 jai sans doute un peu de mal admettre que ce ne soit pas plus copieux ou meilleur march
3720632 iya aku memang pandai berpuisi namun hanya rasa rasa yg keluar begitu saja dan kemudian menjadi basi
3720633 they did a background check prior to hiring mr brown
3720634 they spoke to references of his previous employers they had no information that he had ever been accused of any sexual misconduct when they hired him
3720635 the embedded republican vote in a presidential election has been fairly solid for almost three decades now so you would have to say that mccain has an edge but im going to tell you that the obama people have been pouring resources in here
3720636 the obama campaign has some potential to win some voters to change the dynamics by making a strong run in the big metropolitan areas here filled with high tech workers and the type of people who dont fit the classic old south new south model
3720637 i dont think obamas going to pull through in north carolina hes just not going to get enough of the white vote
3720638 in later level additional time control mechanisms are introduced such as time bubbles
3720639 stuff like flow loco roco and braid are a type of game that has existed online on pc for years and has been enjoyed by the people who are savvy about them samorost being a prime example the critical difference for these games is that now they are being placed into homes for the casual gamer to see
3720640 ill pay 15 for braid with a smile on my face rather than 60 for halo 3
3720641 and you could have had an achievement for finding this castle too
3720642 damn that television dont listen to slimepuppy braid is a good game even though he says it is
3720643 oh holy crap this is going to totally revolutionize human digital interaction for centuries
3720644 you can rewind back as far as you want so why didnt you just keep rewinding
3720645 you know this is the first game to ever view relationships beyond an adolescent level
3720646 i abhor fur so strongly that i would rather go naked
3720647 hey you look slimmer what have you got left to lose what 1 stone how much
3720648 its looking beyond and evaluating a situation while taking into account regional socioeconomic and military processes preparing systems and using good sense and judgment that is not based on familiarity with just one field it means asking the right questions and finding solutions to problems thats what is required in a leader
3720649 and i dont imagine that they were very happy that the syrians are demanding greater us involvement in the syrian israeli talks before agreeing to direct negotiations they also want to be involved
3720650 clearly more americans chose to stay close to home in june than in previous years
3720651 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
3720652 i think people have started to take the increase in gas prices somewhat more in stride
3720653 more americans age 50 plus are trying to leave their cars behind but face obstacles as soon as they walk out the door climb on their bikes or head for the bus
3720654 no we decided it was something we want to do
3720655 ground level o zone is at its highest during the day so please refuel at night
3720656 although it may already be too late fuck it we are doomed change now
3720657 it was not the most positive result last night but we need to put it into perspective
3720658 i was hardly expecting flowers from the press because the score looks bad but we created several chances ourselves unfortunately we also made some mistakes but we have two matches left in which we can put things right
3720659 we got out of that situation in america in the only way you can by working hard having the desire to hit back and understanding the mistakes that youve made
3720660 we must do that again last night we conceded too many goals one of them could have certainly have been avoided because werent quick enough in reacting to their counterattacks but we had as many shots on goal as the netherlands and the same possession and you know sometimes you have an off day and things dont go your way
3720661 i was born in poland and i have a big family there so its a very important thing for me we applied what we worked on in training and must push forward from here
3720662 as i said this is the first step and we must continue we cant relax we have two days to refresh ourselves and then its back to training and everything continues from there
3720663 i think he was the obvious choice for the award because apart from playing very well he scored two goals however it would be unfair to say he was the difference between the two teams because i feel the two central midfield players michael ballack and torsten frings were very important but it would be hard to justify not giving podolski the award because he was very impressive and scored both goals
3720664 it was very important to win the first game and things couldnt have started better for us
3720665 it was a fantastic feeling you could see by the way i reacted to scoring this goal how important it was it was a perfect game to score a goal like that in really it couldnt have been better
3720666 i think it was a difficult match and we did a fantastic job
3720667 we worked hard and played very intelligently it wasnt an easy game for strikers because they had three defenders in the end we won and that is whats important
3720668 tomorrow when youre feeling like crap remind yourself that you were at a punk rock show
3720669 carols surgery was successful we are not out of the woods yet but signs look very positive

3720671 logitech research revealed that the vast majority of people who use a notebook pc are mobile both within and outside the home

3720673 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3720674 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3720675 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3720676 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3720677 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3720678 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3720679 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3720680 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3720681 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3720682 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3720688 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3720689 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3720690 bring your very best offer the first time because i cant guarantee youll get another opportunity
3720691 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3720692 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3720693 horror films for me growing up werent a genre of film that could give you any stronger a visceral reaction through watching it
3720694 i had always heard that as an actor that is something that would draw you to a genre film you can actually affect an audience that powerfully and that quickly so the genre was something i was really interested in
3720695 this character is obviously very different and when you put the two together you can really see that and because
3720696 i dont mean to sound ungrateful or anything but why did you make her so unintelligent
3720697 the idea of having monitors what you call peacekeeping troops i wouldnt call them like that but european controllers monitors facilitators yes yes and yes that is how europe should be on the ground
3720698 we should not have a long discussion on how to respond to the escalation of the last days the eu must decide which role it wants to play in the future
3720699 the international community will want to ensure that the message goes out that force is not the right way to take forward these difficult issues

3720706 rnid supports the position held by the association of medical research charities in that we acknowledge that experiments on living animals are sometimes an essential part of research to improve the understanding and treatment of human and animal disease we only fund research that involves live animals if there is no alternative means the research is novel and of high scientific merit with realistic expectations of benefit for people who are deaf hard of hearing or have tinnitus in addition to requiring researchers to comply with the law we require that all experiments are carried out with due concern for the welfare of the animals using the minimum number necessary to provide clear results
3720707 these breakthrough treatments are for our benefit therefore we will test and trial them on ourselves
3720708 what makes it right that suffering and death should be inflicted on one individual for supposed benefit to another
3720709 socrates is an evil doer and a curious person searching into things under the earth and above the heavens and making the worse the better cause and teaching all this to others
3720710 blessed is he who learns how to engage in inquiry with no impulse to harm his countrymen or to pursue wrongful actions but perceives the order of immortal and ageless nature how it is structured
3720711 there is another form of temptation even more fraught with danger this is the disease of curiosity it is this which drives us to try and discover the secrets of nature those secrets which are beyond our understanding which can avail us nothing and which man should not wish to learn

3720762 thirty four schools are in desperate need of repair if the ministry has reneged on an obligation under the existing law and concordat the board will ensure as far as possible to keep the schools going
3720763 this centre cannot accommodate any school every week sewage has to be pumped from the system as it overflows
3720764 whatever the outcome the schools must be kept going at this point in time they have left the church and the board no choice but to devise means to ensure that the schools are ready for re opening children are of paramount importance which doesnt seem to be the thinking of the ministry especially with rousillac
3720765 what was troubling was the manner in which the ministry was approaching the relationship
3720766 they have issued ultimatums changed positions hardly consulted with the board and this does not only apply to repairs it embraces all the other areas such as appointments particularly with heads of department where the ministry is unilaterally making the decisions without even consulting the board all these things fly in the face of the spirit and content of the concordat the crux of matter resides in the attitude of the ministry in treating with the board

3720790 it could lead to a situation where the cost of private health insurance is prohibitive at a time when public health services for older people are inadequate
3720791 i am not certain at this point that there is a quick legal fix and i want to make that clear
3720792 if there were i would be advocating a recall of the d il to deal with that
3720793 it would not be possible to have insurance affordable to older and sick people if younger people were not paying that little bit more

3721041 better yet the handheld model can also block out daylight so you dont get the usual problem of sunlight washing out the image it is a breakthrough and the daylight blocking hmd will feature this month at siggraph 2008 in los angeles
3721042 it takes a lot of processing power to render a virtual image onto a real landscape mobile device cpus cannot really cope we developed a video streaming protocol that allows a desktop to perform the rendering but then streams a compressed signal across wireless networks
3721043 we are already in discussion with some companies about commercial opportunities for the rendering platform
3721044 in contrast to marker based tracking where we track labels with patterns on it in marker less tracking we detect feature points in real scenes and compare current images from a camera to calibrated reference images of the same scene to calculate the current position of a user
3721045 you get big calibration problems with projectors on multi tiled displays because projectors vary or projector bulbs deteriorate at different rates it affects image quality but our calibration tool ensures faithful colour across the multiple screens
3721046 the mix of applications meant we had to develop low cost but high performance systems the tests were successful and the system performed well
3721047 it is unlikely that the platform will be commercialised as one product but most of the components will have direct commercial potential and many of them are a real advance on what is currently available

3721049 there are some things that need to be told to the public and theres no better medium to communicate than through films
3721050 while this was an abhorrent incident this type of offence on the rail network is extremely rare
3721051 officers in this case have spent many days trawling through cctv from stations between farningham road and victoria and have taken numerous witness statements from members of the public
3721052 id like to take this opportunity to thank those members of the public who came forward and provided us with invaluable information to assist us in this investigation
3721053 sorry robert cant tell you a thing about what im working on
3721054 we can only speculate as to why it is happening but he is of tibetan descent and broadcasts in the tibetan language
3721055 my father had all these old autographed leather chinstraps from the eagles
3721056 if i want to design something ill look at these old catalogs for inspiration
3721057 so if we want to do something based on say a 1930s football jersey itll look authentic instead of just mixing together various retro elements from different eras and if someone else at the company needs some visual reference ill bring in one of my catalogs and charge them a usage fee
3721058 im guessing that picture was taken before the season started
3721059 phillies reliever rudy seanez was scheduled to make a rehab appearance for us on monday he needed a size 7 1 4 home hat but the merch dept was out of it we called all over the lehigh valley looking for a sporting goods store that had the right hat in the right size no dice so we tried to give him a flex fit hat that looks exactly like the home hat almost the new era logo is white instead of red and the milb logo is all blue instead of red blue seanez noticed these differences and refused to wear the hat i have been openly nerdy when it comes to uniform related topics so i was told to fix it i took the flex fit hat and sharpied the white new era flag red simple enough the problem was the blue embroidery on the milb logo i eventually ook a small tack from an office bulletin board and used it to spread red tempera paint over the blue area as far as i know mr seanez had no clue i had doctored his hat and he pitched a perfect 8th inning

3721071 i think ive made a good stance for my place already but im hoping to go back and have two more really good weeks before paul decides on his four wild cards

3721077 we have also discouraged the traditional practice of forcing the circumcised males into sexual intercourse to prove their manhood after the wound heals to avoid the spread of sexually transmitted diseases
3721078 all i know is that when i am circumcised it will not be as easy for me to get infected with hiv aids

3721096 todays u s inventory numbers may offer an olive branch to the bulls out there but any upside move may only be brief
3721097 if crude inventories have increased more than envisaged or gasoline stocks fallen less than predicted a further retreat in oil prices could be triggered
3721098 the whole crisis hardly mattered much to the energy markets to start with as participants were left cold by the fighting all along however the fact that the fighting is declared to be officially over arguably opened the way yesterday for more energy related selling to set in
3721099 with the dollar strengthening the whole purpose of putting money in oil relatively speaking has diminished somewhat
3721100 if we get stats out of the way and move towards the latter half of the week that will be the focus it may be enough to spark a bit of short covering

3721105 ich bin v llig unerfahren gestartet ich war in einem neuen team hatte ein neues motorrad und neue reifen ich musste also in den tests vor dem saisonstart viel lernen als ich dann in katar fast auf die pole position stand wusste ich dass ich eine gute entscheidung getroffen hatte
3721106 in den letzten vier jahren bei den superbikes habe ich mein ding gemacht und rennen gewonnen ich musste nicht viel dar ber nachdenken im moment interessieren mich die resultate nicht so richtig denn es geht nur um stete verbesserung und verkleinerung des abstands nach vorn
3721107 im rennen hatte ich einen tollen start und ich wollte gleich mal in der ersten kurve zehn leute berholen

3721131 the iocs position is clear the media must be free to report on the olympic games
3721132 this is china turning on its hospitality and welcoming people and it isnt just journalists getting the red carpet treatment
3721133 on the substantive issues there hasnt been much movement at all
3721134 the one human rights pledge that china made was that there would be a free media for the games and that just hasnt materialized
3721135 i can give you a general principle that is the chinese government adopts a positive and open attitude and welcomes foreign journalists coming to china and report on the beijing olympics

3721160 were unhappy with what happens when you come home and thats a much larger problem
3721161 it has to do with the uneven nature of medicare in canada and how some provinces seem to excel at it and other provinces dont provide the same quality of it
3721162 but its fundamentally unfair to push the wounded soldiers and already over stressed families onto an already overburdened civilian health care system
3721163 there has to be some sort of inclusion for the long term care costs of rehabilitation and psychological care for the soldiers when theyre in uniform and when they come out of uniform
3721164 the federal government should ensure there are regional centers at a minimum that would provide for the care and the rehabilitiation

3721190 my mom taught me how to teach myself so when i went to college i knew how to do that and not depend on others
3721191 when i was at miami dade i hung out with college students so the social transition to ucf was easy
3721192 i had been their teacher and when they went to miami dade i had to figure out what another teacher was expecting from them at a college level i was helping them to learn to work with the teachers
3721193 the curriculum is free all you have to do is pay for the books my daughter just turned 18 and already she will get her associates degree she has more choices now
3721194 as far as college goes she trusts me to do the work and learn at miami dade i took english math science humanities pretty much all the prerequisites for the associates degree fiu should not be much different though i hear its harder than miami dade
3721195 i didnt have a teacher hanging over me i had to learn things for myself thats also what i found when i went to fiu and took dual enrollment classes
3721196 i kind of got the vibe of college at fiu but i expect things will be different
3721197 ill be in a different city and in art school im expecting many of my classes to be more creative
3721198 im going to be living in a dorm with other students so im expecting more interactions

3721206 the worlds a lonely place its hard to meet people especially someone you like
3721207 its so much easier to come home at night to call an escort service and you know what youre going to get
3721208 i know that ladies will charge that much or more depending on what the gentleman wants
3721209 sees a girl and has a great time and he gives her ten grand who cares
3721210 it doesnt change his life but it is a lot of money and it makes a big difference in her life
3721211 a woman with a little age under her belt has a lot more patience
3721212 shes more versed in the business the young girl a lot of times just starting out doesnt have all the necessary tools that comes with age and it comes with practice its like taking a rookie baseball player versus a seasoned baseball player if you know what i mean
3721213 youre going to do your best to look your best and make the most money
3721214 its very dangerous for an escort and one reason they charge so much is that everyones taking a big risk
3721215 were always being hassled by the police they were always being closed down or shaken down amp i was just so horrified
3721216 to me its like saying is it better to be hit or stabbed i dont want to be hit or stabbed
3721217 prostitution whether its high end or any other form is really just an expression of mens beliefs that women are disposable sexual objects or mens property
3721218 i feel sorry for the poor girl on the corner

3721220 amendments to the ontario energy efficiency act have established minimum efficiencies in 50 product categories that consume 80 per cent of residential energy consumption and 50 per cent of commercial usage
3721221 but even more encouraging is what is in the pipeline for the future ontario appears to be taking energy efficiency very seriously
3721222 weve made some initial progress but weve got a long way to go
3721223 weve done the easy stuff so were going to have to dig deeper
3721224 its nothing but racial profiling that led to the death of that young man
3721225 as soon as they see our kids whether theyre black or latino they see criminals the police are hostile to them they arrest them and sometimes they shoot them
3721226 the police see three individuals of non white culture and they automatically get interrogated and questioned
3721227 its not surprising that people at some point might rise up and say they cannot accept it any more
3721228 the speed at which this whole online environment is operating is a force against trustworthiness
3721229 you move things quickly update them quickly change them quickly it inherently de emphasizes the attention wed normally give to making sure our messages are above board in terms of credibility
3721230 it wasnt very long ago in terms of human history that it took a month for news of the presidents death in the united states to go from washington d c to st louis
3721231 in 20 decades we have gone from that to any individual being able to create a message and instantaneously circulate it to millions of people we find this to be tremendously seductive it gives us a sense of power and a sense of control that we havent had over our environment in the past
3721232 we looked into it reviewed the file and felt that payment was necessary
3721233 theres a real uniqueness to this case and thats why we decided to follow through with payment to cover the drug and medical costs of the family
3721234 his case points to the need to take a hard look at the health care system
3721235 there certainly will be others come forward we have people approaching the ministry all the time asking for out of province coverage some are covered some arent
3721236 because we brought it forward is not the reason why were following through with payment
3721237 we looked at it just from our perspective within the ministry as to what our obligations were and felt that we needed to follow through on this compensation
3721238 there is a still lot to be done here in new brunswick and its all about money and time science and education
3721239 its a never ending process because we are into environmental and climate change
3721240 we keep looking ahead to see what are significant areas that we might want to help protect that wouldnt get protected otherwise
3721241 a lot of those are on the tidal shores because there is a lot of change and erosion that goes on there others are on rivers and lakes
3721242 this is a site of international importance in the migration of hundreds of thousands of shore birds
3721243 this is just one of the examples of the kind of work the nature conservancy of canada does
3721244 this is the birds last refueling stop before flying 4 300 kilometres non stop over the ocean to south america
3721245 the protection of precious habitat across the entire province is our natural legacy to the future generations
3721246 we have now been able to protect the beach so we dont see that happen
3721247 people who have never seen anyone else show these expressions they have the same behavioural responses
3721248 an emotion like fear or anger you dont have to think about who you are
3721249 with pride you do im experiencing these emotions because i just did something that makes me feel good about myself
3721250 if you have a success its really important that other people in the group know that
3721251 pride is a clear signal look at me im powerful
3721252 in western cultures people dont talk about their shame whereas in eastern cultures especially asian cultures shame is an essential part of the cultural fabric
3721253 it was the right thing to do but it was a difficult decision to make because of the supply deficit that has ensued and that were trying really hard to remedy right now
3721254 we regret the inconvenience this is causing our customers and we are working hard to close the gap in supply
3721255 up until now refinery capacity has barely kept up with demand
3721256 in the last decade we have seen a tremendous growth in population and although capacity has grown slightly

3721261 theres no question the selection of tom ridge as john mccains running mate would make our job harder here
3721262 the calgary police service takes any allegations of criminal activity misconduct or improper behaviour against its officers very seriously
3721263 i feel its better than the cfl nfl is real football
3721264 this is cfl country and everyone needs to know it
3721265 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3721266 about two days ago i got pretty upset because since ive been here theyve tested me four times and they took blood a lot of blood
3721267 they are taking so much blood i am going to be very weak before the final of the 100 meters
3721268 kashmiris will continue to agitate peacefully and we should not give indian oppressors any chance to use brute force
3721269 the central government must give the land to the shrine board otherwise our protest will continue
3721270 part of the big challenge we have over the next four to six months is to do this complete audit and inventory of just what is out there
3721271 the eight regional health authorities all had individual deficits and im sure there are some things upon which well save as time goes on

3721498 new orders in q1 outpaced shipments as we received 20 million in new product orders and shipped 5 million in product this backlog increased 14 8 million to a company record of 42 7 million to put this in perspective we ended the first quarter of last year with 5 3 million in backlog and achieved 31 3 in total revenues this year we finished q1 of 2009 with more backlog than we shipped in all of 2008 and almost twice the number in fiscal 2007 if you measure this business by quarterly revenue and backlog combined you will see a much clearer picture of where this business is headed
3721499 i believe this growth demonstrates that our company is reaching an important inflection point despite current economic conditions we are making significant inroads in multiple markets and multiple applications around the world we are benefiting from strong global market drivers of ever increasing energy prices growing grid capacity issues power security and reliability issues and global climate change most importantly we are seeing customers move from demonstration or test projects into product implementation and product adoption

3721517 by ken keyes jr there is a phenomenon id like to tell you about in it may lie our only hope of a future for our species here is the story of the hundredth monkey the japanese monkey macaca fuscata has been observed in the wild for a period of over thirty years in 1952 on the island of koshima scientists were providing monkeys with sweet potatoes dropped in the sand the monkeys liked the taste of the raw sweet potatoes but found the dirt unpleasant an 18 month old female named imo found she could solve the problem by washing the potatoes in a nearby stream she taught this trick to her mother her playmates also learned this new way and they taught their mothers too this cultural innovation was gradually picked up by various monkeys before the eyes of the scientists between 1952 and 1958 all the young monkeys learned to wash the sandy sweet potatoes to make them more palatable only the adults who imitated their children learned this social improvement other adults kept eating the dirty sweet potatoes then something startling took place in the autumn of 1958 a certain number of koshima monkeys were washing sweet potatoes the exact number is not known let us suppose that when the sun rose one morning there were 99 monkeys on koshima island who had learned to wash sweet potatoes lets further suppose that later that morning the hundredth monkey learned to wash potatoes then it happened by the evening every monkey in the tribe was washing sweet potatoes before eating them the added energy of this hundredth monkey somehow created an ideological breakthrough but notice a most surprising thing observed by these scientist was that the habit of washing sweet potatoes then jumped over the sea colonies of monkeys on other islands and the mainland troop of monkeys at takasakiyama began washing their sweet potatoes thus when a certain critical number achieves an awareness this new awareness may be communicated from mind to mind although the exact number may vary the hundredth monkey phenomenon means that when only a limited number of people know of a new way it may remain the consciousness property of these people but there is a point at which if only one more person tunes in to a new awareness a field is strengthened so that awareness is picked up by almost everyone

3721562 the vast majority of lung cancer coverage in the print media is overshadowed and defined by tobacco related issues and does not focus on explaining signs and symptoms of lung cancer to promote early detection highlighting advances in research and treatment and presenting stories of hope and survival
3721563 this research shows that lung cancer related media coverage in ireland is seriously disproportionate to the incidence and mortality from the disease and supports the long held theory evident in other countries that there is a lack of interest in the media in lung cancer
3721564 lung cancer has been the poor relation for too long and we need to work with the media to bring attention to advances in research treatment and services for people with the disease

3721692 when the story of michael vicks dog fighting business came out the general public was given a glimpse of the sadistic world of dog fighting
3721693 they were horrified to learn that dog fighters not only force these animals to fight to the death many also engage in violence against the dogs by means of electrocution strangulation kicking and other unimaginable acts of cruelty the public had known there were evil people out there who trained dogs to fight but it took a big media event to take the barbaric practice of dog fighting to the forefront of their consciousness
3721694 in a sense the vick case was a blessing in the fact that its brought this issue to light that this is happening in our society
3721695 people are learning about the cruelty many pit bulls are forced to endure and more people are turning in suspected dog fighting operations we cant let this issue fall out of the public eye and thats why we are thrilled to partner with andrei the pit bull arlovski
3721696 in the coming weeks andrei will begin working very closely with for pits sake and the knock out dog fighting program and getting all of the interested arlovski com members involved as well

3721701 what i find kind of ironic is to see people like rosa sic ambrose and marjorie lebreton coming on the offensive saying that im offensive to women when they were part of the cabinet that stripped the status of women of its funding and of its right to be active in areas that were assisting women in general and women who wanted to advance their cause

3721704 now has a geopolitical importance that a few years ago wasnt obvious a senior conservative official said noting the regions potential as a new source of oil and gas and also its strategic and environmental risks harpers minority conservative government keeping an eye on a possible election campaign has pledged to buy new arctic patrol ships expand aerial surveillance and bolster the numbers and capabilities of the canadian rangers northern military unit the conservative source said stephane dion leader of the main opposition liberal party had said parks were needed more than ships but this naively ignored strategic realities its real focus boots on the ground that is needed to actively assert canadian sovereignty he said
3721705 dion spokesman mark dunn reacting to the comments turned the argument towards global warming maybe if harper had an environmental policy the arctic would still be frozen

3721712 over the past few months we have experienced an unprecedented disruption in the secondary mortgage markets
3721713 i made the decision to wind down the business with a heavy heart
3721714 capital ones other businesses are supported by ample liquidity and funding including deep access to deposits a stockpile of subordinated credit card funding in place that allows approximately 9 billion of aaa credit card funding going forward and a 25 billion portfolio of highly liquid securities
3721715 the reductions in demand and pricing in the secondary mortgage markets make it difficult to operate our wholesale mortgage banking business profitably
3721716 all the things that had been denied up until this point are unraveling on top of this retail sales were mediocre which shows that indeed the housing collapse is affecting the consumer
3721717 in the last couple of days i think people maybe thought that an all clear had been sounded

3721721 the canadian experience class is one more measure this government is proposing to make our immigration system more attractive and accessible to individuals with diverse skills from around the world and more responsive to canadas labour market needs
3721722 this new proposed avenue for immigration would also go further to spread the benefits of immigration into smaller centres across canada
3721723 choosing newcomers based on knowledge of our labour market and experience within canadian society would make canada a more attractive destination for skilled individuals from around the world
3721724 international students and skilled workers would be more likely to choose canada if they knew their time in canada and contribution to canadian society would assist in their eligibility to apply to stay permanently

3721808 the people hired in an improper way did not themselves do anything wrong it therefore would be unfair and quite possibly illegal given their civil service protections to fire or reassign them without individual cause
3721809 where there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime we vigorously prosecute
3721810 but not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
3721811 it would have ill served the public interest not to appoint him merely because those who first hired him had violated the civil service laws

3721848 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
3721849 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
3721850 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
3721851 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
3721852 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
3721853 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
3721854 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
3721855 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
3721856 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
3721857 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
3721858 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
3721859 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
3721860 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
3721861 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
3721862 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
3721863 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
3721864 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
3721865 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
3721866 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
3721867 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
3721868 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
3721869 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
3721870 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
3721871 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
3721872 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
3721873 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
3721874 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
3721875 thats the first time youve talked to me in years like i said i went to high school withchu
3721876 what you need to understand is that a lot of guys say that they know me when they dont
3721877 but when i try to be nice and say hello the next thing i know theyre following me around and harassing me
3721878 and just because you see me around dont mean you know me
3721879 the second he says that snagglepuss bops out of the store without having bought a thing clearly he understood what the proprietor said about him but somehow i dont think he learned that in mrs bitettis spanish class
3721880 just drive by and let me know what you can do for me

3721885 it is expected that canadas minister of citizenship and immigration will within the next several months be providing instructions to visa offices as to which applications are to be accepted for processing and which are to be returned unprocessed
3721886 the function of art is to clarify intensify or otherwise enlarge our experience of life
3721887 mustikkaan kannattaa edelleen menn mutta siell joutuu kulkemaan kohtuullisen matkan ett saa mp rin t yteen
3721888 me suomalaiset olemme pitk n ajatelleet mustikasta ett se on vain semmoinen marja josta tulee suu siniseksi mutta oikeasti meid n mustikka on ihan kansainv linen huippumarja
3721889 1950 ja 1960 luvulla syntyneet saivat viel jonkinlaisen kosketuksen marjojen poimimiseen mutta 1970 ja 1980 luvuilla syntyneet eiv t silloin arvot olivat toiset

3721895 eine exzellente leistung vor allem die zweite kreuz wo sie sich vom rest der welt deutlich absetzten war wie aus dem lehrbuch gesegelt
3721896 wir sind zur ck im spiel und brennen auf die letzten vier wettfahrten
3721897 wir k nnen mit einem guten gef hl im bauch die akkus aufladen und freuen uns auf eine mit sicherheit spannende fortsetzung
3721898 es war in summe unser bester tag aber wieder k nnen wir nicht ganz zufrieden sein der sieg w re in der dritten wettfahrt m glich gewesen leider sind wir auf der kreuz zu passiv gesegelt haben uns f r keine seite entscheiden k nnen und sind wieder ins packerl reingerutscht
3721899 wir m ssen und werden nun voll angreifen an der spitze dran zu sein ist keine wirkliche befriedigung
3721900 die verh ltnisse sind sehr fordernd f r uns ging es heut ganz klar aufw rts
3721901 diese mauer ist auch nach ihrer berwindung ein symbol entsetzlicher politischer verirrung und damit verbunden mit vielen menschlichen trag dien
3721902 wir m ssen alles tun das informationsbed rfnis nach kr ften zu bef rdern
3721903 dass im herzen der stadt ein authentischer beleg ber die mauer und was sie bedeutet hat fehlt
3721904 dieser streit ist was die anzahl betrifft nach meiner einsch tzung ebenso unn tig wie unw rdig jedes opfer ist eins zu viel
3721905 vor allem die junge generation lebt im bewusstsein dass die vergangenheit der eltern und gro eltern trennung bedeutete
3721906 40 jahre einer getrennten entwicklung kann man nicht ber nacht ungeschehen machen
3721907 das alles kam nicht von selbst und ist auch nicht eine laune der geschichte im jahre 1989 gewesen wie das gelegentlich dargestellt wird
3721908 in every generation there is a chosen one one girl in all the world one born with the strength and skill to hunt the vampires
3721909 se fossi capace di sognare sognerei te e non me ne vergogno
3721910 the findings show a lot of individual change but not a lot of broad trends
3721911 most people go to a place of worship thats a different size but theres no strong trend toward finding smaller congregations or larger ones theres also a lot of change in worship styles but not a big overall trend toward going someplace more contemporary or more traditional
3721912 there has been a man arrested for burglary this morning at an address in shieldfield
3721913 that man is currently detained at pilgrim street police station
3721914 he was not arrested in connection with the murder investigation
3721915 officers from the major investigation team are looking into the circumstances of that burglary and his arrest
3721916 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain infineon is the 3g supplier
3721917 how a device performs in individual situations depends on circumstances like where you are in the 3g coverage how close you are to a cell site
3721918 things like terrain and buildings all come into play im not denying that people are having a less than satisfactory experience but overall the phone is doing great
3721919 this poor woman has had enough boys in her life
3721920 natuurlijk kan het kabinet weinig doen aan de olieprijs op de wereldmarkt maar het kan wel de geplande btw verhoging schrappen en de extra gasbaten aanwenden om de koopkracht op peil te houden balkenende heeft genoeg mogelijkheden om zijn beloften na het zuur komt het zoet waar te maken het is echt een kwestie van politieke wil
3721921 het zou niet meer dan logisch zijn om deze extra inkomsten te gebruiken om de gestegen brandstofprijzen op te vangen
3721922 we kunnen een nieuwe heffing invoeren op de winning van gas en olie uit de nederlandse bodem bedrijven als shell en esso maken er miljardenwinsten mee zij kunnen best iets meer bijdragen ten bate van de koopkracht het is niet rechtvaardig als alle lusten naar de multinationals gaan en de lasten naar de burger
3721923 de geplande verhoging van de btw van 19 procent naar 20 procent mag niet doorgaan dat zou leiden tot nog meer koopkrachtverlies terwijl de inflatie al hoog is maar ook het schrappen van de aftrekmogelijkheid voor bijzondere ziektekosten is zon maatregel dat gaat er toe leiden dat juist een kwetsbare groep extra zorgkosten krijgt voor velen wordt dit een regelrechte aanslag op de portemonnee
3721924 in elk geval moeten deze kosten voor gezinnen met een inkomen tot 60 000 euro bevroren worden de toegankelijkheid en betaalbaarheid van kinderopvang moet gegarandeerd blijven
3721925 apples new acsa courses leopard 301 302 and 401 are the most comprehensive set of technical training classes apple has ever released we are thrilled to be able to offer such high caliber training to it professionals across the country

3721929 we placed our participants in an fmri scanner to measure their brain activity while we first showed our subject short 3s movie clips of an actor sipping from a cup and then looking disgusted
3721930 later on we asked them to read and imagine short emotional scenarios for instance walking along a street bumping into a reeking drunken man who then starts to retch and realizing that some of his vomit had ended up in your own mouth finally we measured their brain activity while the participants tasted unpleasant solutions in the scanner
3721931 is that in all three cases the same location of the anterior insula lit up the anterior insula is the part of the brain that is the heart of our feeling of disgust patients who have damage to the insula because of a brain infection for instance lose this capacity to feel disgusted if you give them sour milk they would drink it happily and say it tastes like soda
3721932 what this means is that whether we see a movie or read a story the same thing happens we activate our bodily representations of what it feels like to be disgusted and that is why reading a book and viewing a movie can both make us feel as if we literally feel what the protagonist is going through
3721933 hey alex im alexis arent i here to meet you

3721940 i did a five album deal and i dont think it would be right to be making streets albums after that i always envisaged them as a box set and ive got a vision for each of the albums
3721941 the next one will bring it back to the start in a way it will be a lot more futuristic in terms of production but a lot more train of thought maybe when im 40 and broke i might come back but that all feels a bit pants
3721942 most of the young volunteers i worked with have been very disappointing and unreliable so i am quite prejudiced against young people however if you prove me wrong i will treat you accordingly can you deal with that
3721943 i must be boring you to tears i have to be present to supervise and observe but i will let you teach a class which class do you want to teach first

3721949 who knows what will happen in a year from now
3721950 the tank crew was unable to determine the nature of the object mounted on the tripod and positively identify it as an anti tank missile a mortar or a television camera
3721951 in light of the reasonable conclusion reached by the tank crew and its superiors that the characters were hostile and were carrying an object most likely to be a weapon the decision to fire at the targets was sound
3721952 i kept on telling my staff im worried about hawaii
3721953 its going to be really embarrassing if we dont pull it out
3721954 i dont know what happened i thought my feet were under me and next thing i know i was on my back
3721955 that it was going to lead to a lot of injuries
3721956 you have to do a bigger variety of difficult skills now
3721957 in our era you could do one or two difficult moves then fill out the rest of your routine with things you are comfortable doing now you have to be a freak of nature to be able to do a world class routine
3721958 everybody knows how rock solid chellsie is and definitely on floor also she had a chance to perform because we all remember what kind of routine she did at the trials
3721959 we throw some of the hardest skills on the floor
3721960 we are built of the strongest legs in the world and we love to fly we love to tumble really hard honestly we do have a problem stepping out of bounds
3721961 i have no proof so i cannot say they are underage
3721962 if that is true which it possibly could be because one of the little girls has a missing tooth then it is totally unfair because it doesnt give an even playing field for people all over the world
3721963 i had no freaking idea there was a war going on down there
3721964 it may be too late to switch to a neutral site
3721965 weve had our hotel reservations for over year and russia can damn well refund our deposit if thats how theyre gonna treat a former soviet state
3721966 when i heard they invaded georgia i didnt think nothing of it cause we could still play our game in greece
3721967 now i come to find out this is a god damn international incident and may affect our bcs ranking
3721968 if a russian comes across the middle on a slant pattern i want you to nuke em
3721969 there wont be any un peacekeepers around if thats your question
3721970 dont think you can come in here with a half assed air attack like russia
3721971 they make up a substantial portion of our force and we couldnt function in afghanistan without them
3721972 stands out like a lamborghini on a car lot dotted with far too many 1970 ladas
3721973 a person whos suffering at home from a psychological injury is as seriously wounded as somebody bleeding on the battlefield
3721974 and we dont leave the people on the battlefield there to bleed
3721975 canadian personnel wounded in the service of their country should receive just one standard of rehabilitative care first class
3721976 it would not be right to talk about these things
3721977 threat to the whole world order and there are many actions to be made in the realm of intelligence and preventive measures
3721978 does not see an action against iran as the right thing to do at the moment
3721979 i love all yall i forgive all yall see yall when you get there
3721980 ive done cut folks ive done stabbed folks ive killed folks
3721981 hed walk down the street with a sawed off shotgun tied to his arm and with a coat on and then just throw it open just to see the reaction of people
3721982 when soldiers returning from vietnam were greeted with abuse when they were accused of murdering women and children when unionists would not load their supply ships back here in australia is it any wonder that the vietnam veteran had some difficulty assimilating back into that society
3721983 were going to continue our peaceful struggle for the return of the president
3721984 we have to prove that what he did in thailand was wrong under british law
3721985 the palestinian side will only accept a palestinian state with territorial continuity with holy jerusalem as its capital without settlements and on the june 4 1967 boundaries
3721986 260 ucas tariff points excluding points from key skills or general studies a level
3721987 all that served with erin wanted him to be beside them especially at the most dangerous times of the mission his sense of humour even in the midst of a firefight was known to inspire and encourage his fellow soldiers he could raise morale with a look a gesture or a practical joke
3721988 im not pointing the finger here other than to suggest that nato and the united nations have to be in constant contact with anyone thats involved in manoeuvres particular missions or assignments
3721989 we cannot have people stumbling into a firefight in this way and engaging the way this group did
3721990 but i dont want to get ahead of where we are in terms of assignment of responsibility theres two military investigations that will look into this
3721991 surat is a huge city but considering all the bombs were planted in areas where the diamond industry is based i think there is a message in that
3721992 the bombs in surat were planted by those who wanted to hurt india economically
3721993 stopping production for one day in the diamond industry means a loss of us 28 million
3721994 with monitoring of implementation of these recommendations weak it is unlikely that workers in small units will get more than a 15 hike
3721995 it might not make much of difference to israeli or antwerp diamantaires who have factories in africa as they are looking at similar costs back home but for indian diamantaires who have the cheap labor option that surat and other towns in gujarat provide shifting processing units to africa doesnt make economic sense
3721996 showed extraordinary strength of character and integrity while reporting the news under dangerous or difficult circumstances
3721997 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time

3722000 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
3722001 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
3722002 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
3722003 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
3722004 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
3722005 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government

3722008 we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract

3722010 they pick the most dangerous enemy they can find and its themselves
3722011 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
3722012 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
3722013 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
3722014 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
3722015 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
3722016 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
3722017 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american
3722018 a combination of differentiated merchandise current fashions and great value
3722019 the french cosmetics company lanc me sells an exclusive perfume under the name
3722020 license to smell the dutch copyright act does not contain an exhaustive list of subject matter that can be protected basically anything can qualify for protection as long as it is perceptible and original the high court ruled that the smell of a perfume may fulfil these requirements even if only perceptible through the nose the court distinguished the scent of a perfume from its recipe or the liquid containing it comparing the latter to the paper of a book which is not subject matter of copyright whereas the content of the book is this distinction implies that a perfume that contains completely different ingredients but smells the same may be infringing while a perfume with a similar formula but a different scent would not be

3722035 mark is een uiterst technische judoka en heeft door zijn stijl minder aanslagen op zijn lijf hoeven te verwerken dan krachtjudokas
3722036 mark heeft door erfelijke eigenschappen een sterk lijf met een goed spierenstelsel uit een meting kwam ook naar voren dat hij zware botten heeft het frame is dus goed ook werd ontdekt dat hij een zeer alert zenuwengestel heeft zoals ik nog nooit bij iemand heb gezien dat maakt het mogelijk ontzettend te pieken exploderen als het ware
3722037 mark ziet ernaar uit andere dingen van het leven te proeven
3722038 de laatste paar jaar ben ik continu bezig hem te vertellen dat hij nog steeds wil judo n
3722039 ik heb de vorm de energie en de kracht de tank zit nog helemaal vol maar ik zal alles door het afvoerputje moeten wegspoelen het is heel jammer ik voelde me super toen ik zag dat ik niet voor de herkansing in aanmerking kwam heb ik even liggen huilen op de mat
3722040 maar ik ben vandaag niet bezig geweest met wat is geweest ik wilde gewoon een medaille winnen en dat is niet gelukt
3722041 wat telt is het nu en de toekomst het is tijd in het diepe te springen en eens te kijken hoe dat zwarte gat eruitziet ik heb het gevoel dat ik met oogkleppen op heb geleefd en dat ik maar een beperkt blikveld heb ik heb weinig vrienden ik voel me niet onbeholpen maar ik wil eens kijken of ik zonder succes toch ook een heel mooi mens kan zijn

3722045 we currently have several customers in ecuador and have deployed thousands of units in this country during the last 12 months significant broadband expansion initiatives are already being planned by pacifictel
3722046 the delivery of next generation broadband services is high on the agenda of the northern ireland assembly
3722047 the fund provides an excellent opportunity to pilot emerging technologies that will inevitably be part of the range of broadband solutions
3722048 one of our biggest challenges will be to identify affordable commercially sustainable solutions for the delivery of services into rural areas
3722049 that challenge is not unique to northern ireland and successes under the fund carry the potential for global application

3722055 we spent the first six or seven months dealing with them to get the money which was owed to us the fire destroyed everything so we had to start from scratch we stripped the place right back to the brickwork and completely rebuilt the interior

3722071 this is a large seizure of illegal cigarettes that without the intervention of ukba officers working alongside revenue and customs colleagues would have flooded our streets
3722072 a vital part of ukba and hmrcs work is to protect the interests of honest shopkeepers by preventing commercial smuggling and the onward transport and sale of illegal cigarettes
3722073 ukba and hmrc are keen to work closely with local people and business communities in the fight against cigarette fraud
3722074 i would urge any member of the public who knows of any illegal tobacco sales or suspicious activity in their area to contact us on our 24 hour confidential helpline 0845 59 5000

3722077 i was told i am not a priority if i had a little kid i would probably find it easier to get a house and i would be on the streets if i was not here
3722078 there are ten of us living here and i feel the council should provide more we go shopping in the village shop we are polite and cause no fuss
3722079 there should be more council housing we just want a place to stay and not have to squat anymore

3722082 the iocs position is clear the media must be free to report on the olympic games
3722083 this is china turning on its hospitality and welcoming people and it isnt just journalists getting the red carpet treatment
3722084 on the substantive issues there hasnt been much movement at all
3722085 the one human rights pledge that china made was that there would be a free media for the games and that just hasnt materialized
3722086 i can give you a general principle that is the chinese government adopts a positive and open attitude and welcomes foreign journalists coming to china and report on the beijing olympics

3722088 this program was implemented as a means to keep these kids busy and out of trouble as well as give them a sense of citizenship and teach them about the importance of why they need to keep their environment clean
3722089 this program keeps them busy and makes them some money
3722090 i think the parents love it because all the kids are actually out doing something together working toward community goals and leaving their differences aside forming a good community

3722288 alles wat we deden leidde tot lawaai publiciteit en onzin de eerste keer liep phil rond met alleen maarbloemen rond haar lijf de tweede keer zat ze naakt op de stoel en toen ze haar krant liet zakken zag je haar blote borstje het is ontzettend lang geleden hoor in 1967 daar denk ik zelf niet zo aan anderen herinneren je eraan dat je oud bent die verhagen die volgend jaar zijn 70ste verjaardag hoopt te vieren schrijven ze dan dat moet ik nog zien ik vier mijn verjaardag trouwens nooit een jongen die hier op bezoek was vond de stones zielig ook omdat ze oud zijn en nog optreden ik weet absoluut niet waarom je de stones zielig zou moeten vinden als ze nou stonden te krukken maar dat is niet zo dat ze nog spelen zal wel voor het geld zijn zelf ben ik vrij welgesteld opgegroeid in vlissingen mijn vader was notaris ik ben periodes straatarm geweest heel vervelend
3722289 in mijn groep is er nooit iemand gepakt in india stond er een half jaar gevangenisstraf op goudsmokkel maar je werkte voor zwitserse banken via tussenpersonen en zij regelden geld en advocaten voor n jongen liep het uit op een half jaar vakantie in een soort bungalow maar er was ook een amerikaan met een grote smoel die ging de grote blanke man uithangen en die moest echt de bak in dat is niet leuk in bombay
3722290 pas sinds kort krijg ik een beurs van het fonds voor de letteren zelfs in 2003 toen mijn verzameld werk eeuwige vlam verscheen en het letterkundig museum een tentoonstelling over mij organiseerde kreeg ik nog een afwijzing mijn werk was literair van onvoldoende niveau daar heb ik toen met succes bezwaar tegen aangetekend maar goed mijn po zie lag altijd v r op de mainstream en dan krijg je gauw kritiek
3722291 dat vind ik moeilijk te zeggen de wereld die ik oproep is een andere dan je doorgaans tegenkomt in po zie het meeste wat geschreven wordt is slappe kost
3722292 ja dat geloof ik wel zoals ik schrijf wij werden als charlatannetjes behandeld door de dames en heren in hun bekakte bakstenen ivoren torentje als jongere werd je met waarheden om de oren geslagen terwijl je het gevoel had dat het anders zat en dat is dan ook gebleken
3722293 weet je wat ze dan schrijven verhagen is boos op de wereld ik ben helemaal niet boos ik accepteer de wereld zoals hij is
3722294 geld neemt overal de macht over en het is een mooi woord geknisper deze regel is niet bepaald polyinterpretabel
3722295 dat is niet de tofste regel die ik heb geschreven politiek gaat altijd over winst en verlies van stemmen net als religie dat vooral een zaak is van zieltjes winnen in de politiek en religie worden veranderingen tegengehouden omdat mensen een positie hebben verworven daar zet ik muziek tegenover als iets van waarde
3722296 dat is waar maar als ik klaag over over wat ik om me heen zie is dat omdat ik denk aan hoe goed en mooi de wereld zou kunnen zijn ik ben daar wel realistisch over zulke dromen worden voortdurend verstoord
3722297 ja we verscheuren onze medemens in draak schrijf ik over geglaceerde babys die worden opgeleid tot witteboordencriminaliteit dat is niet zwartgallig dat is geestig
3722298 als ik dat voorlees dan joelt iedereen zon regel schrijf ik in een opwelling dan denk ik aan sophisticated gedrag waarbij de rotzooi van overal mooi wordt aangekleed net als bij cabaret heb ik ook een ontzettende hekel aan wordt er zogenaamd filosofisch gedaan maar het is verpakking voor ijdelheid voor je verheven voelen boven anderen
3722299 lucebert is een fantastische dichter maar dat is een zwakke regel het is een oppervlakkige waarneming en het is niet waar dat is nou gejammer waar de vijftigers wel een handje van hadden het is zoals ik schrijf want niet in het blote oog van de toeschouwer wordt iets van waarde waarneembaar maar in een alziend hart
3722300 heel lang had ik het idee dat ik niets te zeggen had en nu aldoor wel het ene gedicht lokt ook het andere uit op een geven moment krijg ik vleugels en dan heb ik het gevoel dat ik alles kan en dat alles kan het maria callas gevoel op een vrij magische manier vormen de regels zich dan tot een gedicht of een reeks alsof de woorden komen uit een deel van je bewustzijn waar je niet voortdurend verbinding mee hebt een regel die je bedenkt en weloverwogen neerzet blijkt achteraf altijd te vloeken
3722301 ja zo gaat dat je krijgt die dingen door het klinkt als een meerstemmig koor en daar isoleer ik dan regels uit regels die in het gedicht werken dat is de
3722302 ja mooie po zie h het is ook waar anders zou ik het niet opschrijven
3722303 het gaat over iets dat voor mij heel plechtig is zij is in dat gedicht de personificatie van mijn lang geleden overleden vrouw
3722304 zij heeft me ge nspireerd van meet af aan ik heb in mijn gedichten voorspeld wat er met ons zou gebeuren de hel waarin ik heb geleefd heeft ook met haar te maken
3722305 dat hebben er wel meer gedaan roland holst bijvoorbeeld en ik heb niemand vermoord hoewel sommigen daar anders over denken ik wek niet iemand tot leven het gaat me om het verlies niet alleen van een geliefde verlies is het leven zelf je krijgt iets en raakt het weer kwijt
3722306 ik ben me er allengs minder van aan gaan trekken mijn eerste bundels werden gunstig ontvangen maar ik merkte dat die critici voornamelijk de flaptekst overschreven
3722307 ik bedoel echt snelheid anders had ik wel speed geschreven dit gaat over het ongeduld waar ik aan lijd over het alles tegelijk willen doen en zeggen dat zijn vervelende periodes maar die horen ook bij de total experience van het leven
3722308 ja ik lijd aan depressies en ik ben ontzettend bang dat het zo erg wordt als bij manisch depressieven ik doe er alles aan om dat te voorkomen als er een middel is om mezelf een opdonder te geven dan prefereer ik dat
3722309 nou ik rook wel eens een stick maar goede speed is niet meer te krijgen goede hero ne ook niet dat lees je nooit in de krant hero ne is tegenwoordig bruin het is een soort crack gemaakt van coke dat werkt nauwelijks bij mij ik heb wel vrienden die gebruiken en zelf doe ik ook wel eens wat bruin maar echt lekker is het niet hero ne vond ik vroeger verschrikkelijk lekker dan kwam je in een andere wereld terecht dat was een wonder
3722310 wat ik doe is de dood niet serieus nemen in de dood zeg ik dat ik ergens anders heen wil alsof het een vakantiebestemming is die me niet bevalt
3722311 ik debuteerde in 59 met twee gedichten in het tijdschrift podium mijn moeder lag op sterven ze heeft nog net de drukproeven kunnen zien mijn vader had daar om gevraagd hij vond wat ik deed wel leuk en aardig maar mijn moeder hield echt van po zie zij interesseerde zich voor alles wat ik schreef
3722312 ja vlak daarna raakte ze in coma het was verschrikkelijk
3722313 mijn moeder heeft die foto van conny gemaakt op het strand een kiekje mijn moeder had kanker mijn vader is 85 geworden ook kanker
3722314 over mijn eigen einde maak ik mij geen zorgen ik ben niet ziek ik denk er wel eens aan maar over de dood kun je niks zinnigs zeggen net zo min als over god of over po zie

3722332 there is one god the father of whom are all things and we for him
3722333 although they knew god they did not glorify him as god and changed the glory of the incorruptible god into an image made like corruptible man
3722334 and it shall come to pass that everyone who is left of all the nations which came against jerusalem shall go up from year to year to worship the king the lord of hosts

3722369 every few years here comes another fraudulent scandal riddled faith healer thats sadly no surprise i am not dubious about healing i believe that god heals today we all know however that there are those who will use the power of god to peddle a product whats most tragic about this cycle though is the fact that theres always a constituency for guys like this i fear that its more than just p t barnums famous old maxim about the gullibility of the american public i fear that theres something missing in our churches that drives even some of our people to charlatans might there be less of a demand for these traveling health and wealth revivalists if our churches spent more time on our knees in prayer for sick and hurting people

3722384 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3722385 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3722386 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope

3722390 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3722391 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3722392 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3722393 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
3722394 doesnt look like all those presidents on the dollar bills
3722395 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
3722396 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
3722397 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
3722398 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
3722399 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
3722400 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
3722401 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
3722402 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
3722403 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
3722404 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
3722405 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
3722406 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
3722407 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
3722408 propensity to vote is in part based on enthusiasm but its more typically assessed using voting history and intention among other factors

3722412 in countless public fora the bush administration has pledged its committment to georgias territorial integrity that committment has always been followed by the hope that all potential conflicts would be resolved peacefully administration officials insist that in private conversations at the highest levels they have told the georgians that their committment did not include military intervention on georgias behalf and say they have repeatedly urged the georgians not to provoke the russian bear but this stance gives rise to a question at natos most recent summit the administration pushed very hard to grant georgia a place on the initial rung of the ladder toward nato membership european governments blocked that attempt but u s remains committed to getting georgia into the atlantic alliance the definition of nato membership of course is a mutual defense committment an attack on one equals an attack on all are we ready to go into battle against russia to defend georgia in nato
3722413 this question has gotten pretty heavy coverage over the past week

3722415 republicans are moving to examine surges in voter registrations in some states a republican lawyers group held a national training session on election law over the weekend that included campaign attorneys for sen john mccain and other republican leaders one session discussed how party operatives can identify and respond to instances of voter fraud
3722416 republicans said they are particularly worried about prospects for fraud in virginia and pennsylvania and are beginning to comb thousands of new registrations in those states for ineligible applicants in some cases the huge numbers threaten to swamp their efforts and those of state and local governments to verify and process applications election officials in virginia and other states say there is no evidence of widespread fraud so far numerous studies have found fraud and other voting irregularities in past elections to be infrequent and generally not prevalent enough to influence the outcomes of most contests some republican lawyers say that despite the huge numbers of new registrations in some areas this years problems could be fewer compared to prior years because of improved procedures and tougher rules
3722417 regardless of how the voters got on the rolls johnson said the sheer number of democrats is a concern this year as is the fact that more hispanics are now registered democrats about 455 000 hispanics are now in the democratic party which only this year surpassed republicans who count 425 000 in their ranks compared to the last presidential election the numbers are even more dramatic for african americans more than 207 000 have joined the democratic party since 2004 accounting for 44 percent of the new voter growth
3722418 the boom that turned swamps and pastures into a suburban mecca has stopped dead now the talk is about plummeting home values rising food costs and gas prices that make the once painless half hour commute to tampa a financial strain its enough to give some here the sense that maybe this time around the republicans do not deserve their votes
3722419 even as younger voters are showing signs of breaking with years of lackluster turnout to support him obama is facing singular resistance from voters over 65 that age group turns out at the highest rate on election day and is disproportionately represented in the swing states of florida and pennsylvania bill clinton and al gore both relied on it in winning the democrats only popular vote majorities of the past two decades
3722420 with polls showing obama dominating among those under 40 and running even among middle aged voters republican john mccains lead among those 65 and older is the main reason he remains close overall his margin is largest among older white voters without a college education accounting for much of obamas problem with the white working class
3722421 by this time in 2004 president bushs re election campaign had spent 13 5 million on television in florida the president went on to win the state in november sen obamas ads have touched every media market in florida which is the most expensive for advertising among the closely fought states

3722429 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3722430 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3722431 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3722432 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3722433 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3722434 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3722435 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3722436 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3722437 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3722438 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3722439 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3722440 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3722441 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3722442 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3722443 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3722444 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3722445 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing

3722448 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
3722449 the problem of maximizing power from sunlight has been known for at least 30 years and is primarily one of physical limitations not engineering technology

3722452 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
3722453 real results by the end of my first term in office
3722454 take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
3722455 leverage billions more in private capital to build a new energy economy
3722456 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
3722457 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
3722458 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
3722459 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
3722460 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
3722461 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
3722462 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
3722463 when fuel gets more expensive wont voters object just as strenuously as they would have if a carbon tax had been imposed in the first place
3722464 police in kingston have issued cctv images of a man they wish to trace in connection with a
3722465 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
3722466 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
3722467 if black people kill black people every day why not have a week and kill white people
3722468 are you better off now than you were four years ago
3722469 it looks like its going slow but theres a lot of torque generated which can make the gears go faster
3722470 on the low end 30 mph wind could generate about 500 watts
3722471 when he was growing up i was cleaning up his room and i remember finding this thing that looked like a bomb
3722472 i dont know how he learned but he knows how
3722473 he knows how to build everything hes always on the computer reading about how things work
3722474 he first got interested in physics and then when we went to louisiana he got interested in meteorology
3722475 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
3722476 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
3722477 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
3722478 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
3722479 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
3722480 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
3722481 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
3722482 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
3722483 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
3722484 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
3722485 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3722486 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3722487 he nader is a reminder that the democratic process is alive and well and still being practiced
3722488 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
3722489 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
3722490 to elsie i think that we do not have a real good choice with either candidate but i fail to see how you think obama will help with our moral decline as he apparently is a strong supporter of abortion and gay rights
3722491 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
3722492 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
3722493 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
3722494 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
3722495 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
3722496 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
3722497 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
3722498 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
3722499 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3722500 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3722501 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3722502 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3722503 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3722504 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3722505 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3722506 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3722507 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3722508 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3722509 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3722510 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3722511 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3722512 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3722513 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3722514 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3722515 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3722516 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3722517 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
3722518 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
3722519 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
3722520 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3722521 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect

3722524 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
3722525 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
3722526 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
3722527 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
3722528 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
3722529 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
3722530 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
3722531 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
3722532 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
3722533 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
3722534 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
3722535 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
3722536 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
3722537 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
3722538 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
3722539 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
3722540 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
3722541 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
3722542 the terrorist explosion directly targets the army and peaceful co existence in the country
3722543 the army and security forces will not be terrorised by attacks and crimes that target it and civil society and the history of the army attests to that

3722553 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence

3722567 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
3722568 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
3722569 if we dont reach out to evangelical christians and other religious americans and tell them what we stand for then the jerry falwells and pat robertsons and alan keyeses will continue to hold sway

3722576 essa conta deve ser paga tamb m pelo resto do mundo via eleva o de pre os
3722577 os investimentos para esta safra foram muito elevados os custos dobraram
3722578 vamos ter de diminuir os investimentos com adubos herbicidas diesel etc tentando interferir o m nimo poss vel na produtividade
3722579 muita gente se vender tudo n o paga as d vidas
3722580 se antes j era dif cil a obten o de cr dito imagine agora
3722581 algu m vai acabar pagando essa conta que deveria ser mandada para os fundos de investimentos que participaram do mercado de commodities agr colas
3722582 sem o est mulo do pre o para 2009 a rea de produ o n o cresce e teremos mais um cen rio de alta em 2009 segundo ele
3722583 as pessoas com quem eu falei possuem vis es dramaticamente diferentes do que estes rendimentos e condi es da safra mostram elas est o muito mais cautelosas e muito mais conservadoras
3722584 importante notar que a maior parte dos ganhos inesperados na produ o foram compensados pelo aumento na demanda e o fato de o usda ter fixado a demanda por etanol em 4 1 bilh es de bushels neste ano implica ao menos para mim que haver pelo menos 4 5 bilh es de bushels em 2009 10 disse feltes
3722585 obviamente o usda confirmou como a safra parece boa mas na an lise final n o achamos que os rendimentos podem ser t o altos
3722586 as pessoas est o se dirigindo para a sa da agora e fazendo perguntas depois e quando isso acabar os pre os dos gr os devem subir novamente
3722587 what have you given up for the sake of christ
3722588 have made choices with that lifestyle and the basis of those choices was conformity to the
3722589 much of the criticism directed towards the gimp come from users who do not or should not need to use it
3722590 much of the criticism directed towards the gimp come from users who do not or should not need to use it
3722591 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3722592 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3722593 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3722594 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3722595 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3722596 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3722597 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3722598 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3722599 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3722600 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3722601 this is such a fun place to be part of staff is so fun to get to know from their cleaning lady with all the cats to management from monk murry and
3722602 in addition the prevalence of hiv infection and potential risk factors differed by gender but a finding we didnt anticipate is that living in tijuana for longer periods was associated with lower hiv prevalence in men which is the opposite of what we found in women among women longer term residents in tijuana actually had a higher risk of hiv infection
3722603 with disintegrating family support networks sudden changes in a persons cultural environment homelessness and poverty were more apt to see risk behaviors such as unprotected sex with sex workers other men or sharing injection needles among male migrants
3722604 however an alternate explanation could be that deportation from the united states leads to social upheaval loss of social ties and income factors which lead to engaging in high risk behaviors

3722608 it was an advantage to be more anxious in a dangerous environment

3722619 it was massive and it took a while to sink in it was very difficult to leave the reds as i had been there for 10 years
3722620 it was my home and it matured me into a man and i guess for that security reason it was very difficult to leave
3722621 its very exciting as its got a very similar feeling to ballymore in that the crowd feels as though it is going to be on top of you so youre going to be up close and personal with them

3722629 americans are tired of partisanship they want us to work together for america in a bipartisan fashion

3722631 we will fix social security and we will do it in a bipartisan fashion
3722632 he needs social conservatives to rally to his cause they are the bulwark of the party but he has to attract the middle
3722633 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
3722634 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
3722635 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
3722636 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
3722637 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
3722638 no one in the democratic party would want to be publicly associated with him
3722639 he was raised as one of us the son of a mill worker he always said
3722640 fighting poverty and providing health care for everybody i hope those are still always his beliefs
3722641 had that not happened i think he would have made an absolutely incredible secretary of labor
3722642 we would have loved to see him play a prominent role in government
3722643 he was the first person since lyndon johnson to address it in a meaningful way
3722644 he was very sincere about wanting to cure the problems
3722645 hes going to have to rebuild his base from the bottom
3722646 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway i mean im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing

3722664 alguna vez tendr al presidente garc a en mi programa
3722665 el presidente no me ha desmentido lo que ha hecho es responder a una invitaci n que hice p blica hace dos semanas l garc a ha sido muy amable en contestarme a trav s de su jefe de prensa jos chirito y ha tenido palabras muy lindas para con el programa
3722666 nuestro presidente no est yendo a programas de televisi n m ximo ha ido a uno o dos
3722667 su negativa no es un desplante s de su recargada agenda y agradezco que chirito me haya contestado ayer
3722668 hasta el momento no he recibido ning n pedido o requerimiento de esa naturaleza pero debo aclarar que mientras existe un conflicto entre la municipalidad de lima y la empresa lidercon la pnp se mantendr al margen hasta que no se defina una soluci n legal por lo tanto no se dispondr operaciones para detener a los veh culos que no se sometan a las revisiones t cnicas
3722669 la validez legal se sustenta en la decisi n del tribunal arbitral de la c mara de comercio de lima el cual ha ordenado a las partes lidercon y la municipalidad que reiniciemos las revisiones t cnicas

3722672 a day spent fishing extends a persons life by a day
3722673 we think that by 2011 at the latest these cigarettes will be on the market
3722674 i let you into my house you let me into your blouse
3722675 i cant tell someone that just registering and voting is going to change their life
3722676 the system itself is broken due to the creation of safe districts for incumbent legislators we have the least competitive legislative races in the nation with most seats being uncontested and the sad reality is that 98 percent of the candidates who spend the most money are the ones who win
3722677 we need to build a base of support a movement for social justice that politicians will have to respect
3722678 we are registering people to vote not to support a particular candidate but to become part of the movement that will have the power to actualize our values
3722679 what always horrifies me is that no matter what side of the political spectrum youre on there is a relatively small number of people who actually elect our public servants
3722680 as the 19th century came to a close the american electorate changed more and more rapidly
3722681 a military force serving the interests of the democratic party
3722682 revive the dead and hateful race and sectional animosities in any part of our common country
3722683 means confusion distraction of business and the reopening of wounds now happily healed
3722684 when i use a word humpty dumpty said in rather a scornful tone it means just what i choose it to mean neither more nor less
3722685 with the election of harry truman democrats began the fight to bring down the final barriers of race
3722686 democrats began to bring down the final barriers of race
3722687 tickets for the reception where clooney will speak are going for 1 000 followed by a dinner at the home of nfc member charles adams for 10 000 a plate space for the dinner is limited to 75 guests
3722688 maybe during the convention the republicans can dedicate a large screen monitor at the xcel center to keep track of obamas second european jaunt of the campaign they could call it where in the world is barack obama the show could track him through the summer houses of the rich and famous americans who can afford to own villas overseas and put dollar signs up on a map wherever he stops off for some foie gras
3722689 the populations seem to be gradually going downhill and its not clear if or when thats going to stop
3722690 within a decade we may not have any in washington unless they do something
3722691 i have not lost hope for spotted owls but i think were at a pretty serious crossroads
3722692 theres no way at this point to predict how this will ultimately play out
3722693 someone described it as a bathtub its just filling up with barred owls
3722694 if you get a room of field biologists people who have been out in areas where barred owls are present in any number you dont get any disagreement about it
3722695 as a society we may choose not to control barred owls but we ought to do it with the knowledge of what would it take and is it feasible
3722696 you could shoot barred owls forever and as soon as you quit theyre going to be right back
3722697 theyre pulling the habitat rug out from underneath a declining species
3722698 there really isnt any evidence to suggest that creating more habitat reserves will alter adult owl survivorship
3722699 all youre doing is protecting more habitat for the barred owl
3722700 vi er meget stolte av v re fotballsendinger og har derfor valgt gi fri tilgang til mer enn 1 5 millioner husstander som n f r oppleve pningen til en av verdens beste fotballigaer
3722701 we only do 60 cities that leaves me 300 days a year to do something else
3722702 whatever i wrote last year is what i recorded this year
3722703 if the world needs savin and the polar caps are melting shouldnt we all check in and see if were destroying this sucker
3722704 its amazing that i can sell 35 million albums and have 50 million spins as a writer and one three minute song carries more weight than all of that combined
3722705 first of all you cant go make everyone understand what you do
3722706 now two years after that song comes out we go into iraq now all of a sudden im responsible for the iraq war i cant go tell everybody to listen to the words and tell them i have nothing to do with the iraq war my philosophy on that is i think we need to take care of afghanistan and get osama bin laden but im not going to apologize for being patriotic and wherever the troops go ill go there and play
3722707 i dont think anyone should listen to what stupid celebrities say if someone endorsing someone is going to change the way you vote then youre not taking advantage of your american right here everybody needs to educate themselves and vote the best they can
3722708 they can buy a locomotive anyplace in the world they can buy it anyplace in the world but they buy it here because its the most fuel efficient and its the most environmentally sound and it requires the least maintenance
3722709 i want you and every american to tell the congress that when we start anew in january of 2009 lets sit down together republican and democrat libertarian vegetarian whoever it is lets sit down together and start working on these problems together and put our country first
3722710 now if youd just raise your hand we have some people with a microphone or if youd like to go back to work whichever
3722711 where did the internet come from besides al gore and by the way i have great respect for vice president gore
3722712 eighty four percent of the american people think that the countrys on the wrong track congress has a 9 percent approval rating now you get down to 9 percent youre down to paid staffers and blood relatives you cant get much lower than that
3722713 um call tom ridge to washington from whatever vacation he is taking and get him to work
3722714 who will be the next president of the united states
3722715 the most productive and most competitive worker in the world resides in the united states of america
3722716 drilling offshore isnt the answer either but its a bridge its an important bridge to exploit our own oil and natural gas reserves while were making this transition that we must make to energy independence
3722717 i liked what he had to say today i want to hear more of what hes going to do to solve our issues
3722718 its a very important thing to do in life vote for someone thats going to run your future
3722719 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
3722720 in a seven hour span friday detroit mayor kwame kilpatrick endured a surreal journey that found him pleading to get out of jail in the morning facing a pair of new felony charges shortly afterward standing glumly for an eerie video arraignment in the afternoon and finally arriving back at city hall wearing jeans a dress shirt and electronic tether
3722721 the mayor is simply less intimidating today with a tether around his ankle than he was in 2002 or 2003 when he was firing cops who disagreed with him
3722722 others were more explicit about how they thought the distraction should be brought to an end several area leaders made or renewed calls for kilpatrick to either resign or be removed from office some did so quietly while others made public statements
3722723 its going to be broadcast all around the world and its one more blow that the city of detroit should not have to take and for that matter it involves in a negative way the image of the entire region
3722724 if youre doing business in the city of detroit if you own assets in the city of detroit if your corporate headquarters or other buildings that you own and operate out of are operating in the city of detroit you have a voice you have a stake in what happens in this city and you ought to be using that voice to express your concerns about your stake in this city
3722725 alright i guess i just dont know if i believe all the shit eh sorry stuff
3722726 well thats nothing to be embarrassed about i have my doubts too sometimes
3722727 how am i supposed to tell an angel that i dont believe god
3722728 please help us shrink the supply of oil and block refinery and nuclear plant construction so that the price of gasoline and power will be so expensive well have to live like our great grandparents without cars modern electric powered appliances airplanes and without the things made in factories and raised on modern farms
3722729 im trying to save the planet im trying to save the planet
3722730 this is an enormous waste of law enforcement resources that should be focused on violent and serious crime
3722731 an addictive drug which induces in its users insanity criminality and death
3722732 the perception that marijuana is about fun and freedom it isnt its about dependency disease and dysfunction
3722733 not soon but eventually youll see the development of a marijuana futures market
3722734 thin film is really the leading edge for satisfying demand from the utility market
3722735 utilities are sophisticated buyers all they care about is the lowest cost
3722736 the whole market can see a lot of really impressive growth in the long run but thats not to say thin film will displace everything else
3722737 there are high hopes of them launching a business model with electric utilities
3722738 the utility market is a market that could be the gold mine for the solar industry but we dont know how the subsidies are going to play out
3722739 there are a number of key questions that nobody has an answer for
3722740 if the subsidy is given to utilities then all they need is first solar to come in and sell modules or systems
3722741 in that process utilities could potentially put more pressure on first solar to lower prices
3722742 we did a lot of things while shooting for the movie including riding on the highest roller coaster in the world
3722743 mahi is a 17 year old girl from amritsar who believes in a fairy tale end of a story
3722744 mahi is a 17 year old girl from amritsar who believes in a fairy tale end of a story
3722745 i am the only one who is indianised in the film my role is set in the year 1996 and i play a punjabi girl but we did not want the appearance of being generally punjabi we wanted to keep and slightly funky modern
3722746 my character brought mahi patiala salwars with spaghetti and top with capris kurtis in fact the patiala salwars with highs has become a rage among students in mumbai i do not know if delhi
3722747 bachna ae haseeno my role is 180 degrees from that of mini in dus kahaniyaan
3722748 mahi is a city born and hip punjabi girl his family is rich and it goes on a trip around the world unlike mini which was a strict rural background
3722749 i always knew what i was getting into i always wanted to play well defined roles
3722750 if i reveal the plot of the movie why go and look
3722751 this is being done in a friendly and straightforward way
3722752 it is also all about what we can do to reduce our carbon footprint and greenhouse gases
3722753 these are all small things and they all add up
3722754 inquests that are deemed a risk to national security by the government would be held in secret in future under proposed powers to come before the house of lords this autumn
3722755 hard to see how the claim could be convincingly substantiated
3722756 a level and gcse grades achieved in 2007 certainly do correspond to a lower level of general academic ability than the same grades would have done in previous years
3722757 whether or not they are better taught makes no difference to this interpretation the same grade corresponds to a lower level of general ability
3722758 the quality of work presented for examination may well be equal to or better than that of candidates in previous years
3722759 however given identical conditions todays candidates might nevertheless be unable to match the performance of their predecessors
3722760 the government has been undermining a levels for the last few years
3722761 we are determined to restore public confidence in the a level as the gold standard of british education
3722762 weve commented on durham universitys research time and time again
3722763 their work is quite different to gcse or a level as it uses aptitude tests which are not directly comparable to performance at gcse and a level
3722764 an english pipe fitter who was racially abused and taunted in his irish workplace has been awarded 30 000 in compensation by an equality tribunal in dublin
3722765 no englishman can open his mouth without causing another englishman to despise him
3722766 this house will in no circumstances fight for king and country
3722767 the object in life is not to be on the side of the majority but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane
3722768 oh yeah but hes not as good as al gore if only al gore had won did i tell you how much i like al gore
3722769 its no good running a pig farm badly for 30 years while saying really i was meant to be a ballet dancer by then pigs will be your style

3722771 its important that people realise that not having a degree isnt the end of the world
3722772 there are lots of options for young people to build a successful career in their industry of choice however if youre young and starting to make money its a good idea to start thinking about saving for the future nobodys young forever
3722773 many 16 21 year olds now make the choice to go straight to work rather than university and as a result are very career driven we think it is important to recognise those who are just starting out in their working life and offer them support especially in the first stages of their professional lives when they are likely to be making important financial decisions
3722774 with this in mind the premier 21 account has been launched to allow this group to maximise the potential of their hard earned cash the account offers a 10 interest rate the highest credit interest rate on the high street to help make their money go further
3722775 sebodoh bodoh manusia adalah seseorang yang meminjamkan bukunya pada orang lain tapi lebih bodoh lagi orang yang mengembalikan buku yang telah dipinjamnya
3722776 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
3722777 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
3722778 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
3722779 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3722780 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
3722781 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
3722782 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
3722783 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
3722784 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
3722785 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
3722786 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3722787 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
3722788 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
3722789 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
3722790 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
3722791 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
3722792 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
3722793 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
3722794 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
3722795 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
3722796 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
3722797 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3722798 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
3722799 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
3722800 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
3722801 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3722802 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
3722803 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
3722804 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
3722805 radio serves you meatloaf and you know theres steak back in the kitchen
3722806 the scale of the casualties of the war as devastating as they are today was greater back then in vietnam
3722807 plus there was a draft young people then and now are consumers of popular music and there would have been more urgency back then about current events and that would be felt in the kind of music theyd be demanding
3722808 people want to be able to escape when they go into a movie theater put on their ear buds or pick up a trash novel were the stakes higher it wouldnt be as easy to simply escape and you might see more willingness to engage things that address the state of the world
3722809 it causes radio to become more of a mirror rather than a leader
3722810 so when something comes down the pike musically that smacks of controversy and that may blow either way politically and might incite people to feel or react thats considered a risk and with shareholders risk is a bad word
3722811 why would any musician whos ambitious care about what radio stations think theyre not stupid they know radio stations wont play something controversial college public and satellite radio might play it though the other interesting thing about this is that even the toby keith jingoistic material is at a minimum
3722812 in my business theres a term called being dixie chick ed
3722813 ashamed the president of the united states is from texas
3722814 even if some artists might support the war or mccain it would be an unpopular decision to say so and that translates into what youre seeing in music right now a lot of fear
3722815 i hear it all the time on a consumer level a lot of people are getting fed up with the type of music being played
3722816 they played the song once and theyd get a flood of phone calls
3722817 the stations are still after ratings but there are songs that will come through and will alter whats acceptable and push the boundaries id be very surprised if we didnt start seeing more of this
3722818 anti war music has come and gone in waves over the past few years
3722819 while it was easy to believe that artists had been scared into silence many just needed a year or two to get an album out similarly a lot of songs with references to hurricane katrina are just coming out now so we could indeed have the next big statement sitting as a demo on some artists laptop as we speak

3722822 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
3722823 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
3722824 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
3722825 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
3722826 erwarte nicht dass sie wissen was ein verb oder ein nomen ist und das wort lernen k nnen sie noch nicht mal buchstabieren
3722827 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3722828 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3722829 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3722830 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3722831 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3722832 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3722833 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3722834 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3722835 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3722836 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3722837 hands down heath ledger will win best supporting actor and he would have won best supporting actor even if he didnt die
3722838 i just didnt get the appeal of a character who possesses some sort of super human power
3722839 i wonder if its a mistake to elevate an action film like the dark knight to the level of serious film discourse i read names like godard and lean and wince nolan is an accomplished filmmaker who has sold a bit of his soul to make a blockbuster and as penance has inserted evocations of serious issues into this movie i e the references to 9 11 domestic surveillance torture etc i dont think hes really dealing with the issues so much as co opting them to project a veneer of respectability it reminds me of the scene in children of men where one can clearly see an image appropriated from the abu ghraib photos it was the least effective part of an otherwise incredible film and unnecessarily heavy handed
3722840 the dark knight is the fever dream of a white supremacist who listens to way too much wagner
3722841 did the germans give up when we bombed pearl harbor

3722928 we are working very hard in the 1st congressional district to elect democrats thats where our focus has been we did nothing to organize any democrats to vote in the 1st congressional district for either davis or roe
3722929 we have some debt that will be paid out of that

3722935 this is not a matter of the hospital being at fault or the former board acting inappropriately
3722936 it is a case of the department of health appointing and then protecting a ceo through concealment and deceit

3722951 bound to be the case that theres a quarter or two of negative growth
3722952 the adjustment of the uk economy to higher commodity prices and a more realistic pricing of credit will be painful
3722953 the next year will be a difficult one with inflation high and output broadly flat but with monetary policy focused on its task of bringing inflation back to the target we will come through the adjustment
3722954 and we will return if not to the nice decade then at least one that as central bankers say is not so bad
3722955 although the report dilutes fears that the bank of england will raise interest rates it also suggests that any cuts will be some time off as the bank is determined to show its commitment to bringing inflation down to 2
3722956 while we would not rule out a cut in november particularly if the economy slows markedly further and oil prices continue to retreat we are maintaining our view that interest rates will stay at 5 until early 2009
3722957 the balance of risks surrounding the central projection is judged to be on the downside so implicitly technical recession is more likely than not
3722958 the british economy is going through a difficult and painful adjustment to higher energy and commodity prices and in banking credit and housing markets

3722960 mervyn king has given us a frank assessment of britains economic prospects in marked contrast to the tired mantra from uk prime minister gordon brown that britain is well prepared for the economic downturn
3722961 today we have had a triple dose of bad economic news inflation forecast to hit 5 economic growth at a standstill and unemployment rising at its fastest rate since 1992
3722962 gordon brown failed to prepare our economy for this slowdown instead of hiding in his bunker its time he was straight with people about the problems we are facing
3722963 this report gives added authority to other forecasts which suggest next year will be truly dreadful
3722964 with no growth and inflation running higher than at present levels we can expect to see a squeeze on living standards and rising unemployment
3722965 the bank of england is undoubtedly right to hold out the prospect of improved conditions in two years time providing that interest rate discipline is maintained
3722966 however it is very difficult to see how a weakening government with minimal political authority is going to stagger though next year when economic conditions are deteriorating

3723067 foreclosures in a neighborhood affect the value of all homes in that neighborhood
3723068 therefore while the consumers facing foreclosure are directly affected by countrywides practices all homeowners are indirectly affected
3723069 as a child i pictured god to be of male gender
3723070 god is the creator of gender and not subject to it
3723071 we are extremely pleased to have ryan join our club
3723072 hes an extremely fast skater with good hands he has a strong desire to win and he brings tremendous leadership qualities to the table all of these were key ingredients for us to bring him to florida

3723077 on an average dells revenue grew 50 per cent year on year in every quarter on a current rate we should be able to achieve 1 billion in revenue by 2009
3723078 when companies are under cost pressure people look for ways for becomoing more productive i do think the industry growth will be healthy but i expect dell to grow faster than the industry
3723079 we will examine the constitutional question involved in the matter

3723083 i still was trying to understand what was going on because it happened so quick my main concern was i wasnt going to let this lady in the cockpit
3723084 can you look into my eyes and tell me where i am going to go
3723085 how is it you were totally incapacitated for those five days
3723086 can you explain how passengers or the captain were not aware of that
3723087 copper is at most risk for further weakness if inventories rise
3723088 we havent had a very large inventory build so the proof of slowing growth just isnt there yet
3723089 wide spread lending has forced the forward spreads in massively forcing nearby shanghai copper into a premium over lme prices
3723090 from a technical point of view lead has looked weak for several days
3723091 with the metal looking oversold prices should stage a technical bounce the key however is whether the recent slump triggers any physical buying interest
3723092 copper has been sold off together with the rest of the commodities partly due to the dollar strength and partly in response to a perceived turn in inventories

3723096 your first weapon is yourself and you have to be able to trust yourself
3723097 what happens as a result of this workshop is an internal shift you see things differently you have a different sense of who you are and you begin to live in the present
3723098 a lot of choices are being taken away from us
3723099 it is now our job to train ourselves how to deal with what is going on
3723100 they learn to come from a place of joy and self trust instead of denial and fear and begin living their own potential
3723101 its as if their body takes a giant sigh people can find their joy again
3723102 it has been a quite good month for the market and volume alone rose by about 30pc compared with same period last year
3723103 for several years after the implosion of the soviet empire and the end of the cold war the u s assured boris yeltsin and his successor vladimir putin that washington was not interested in expanding natos writ to include former soviet republics that assurance was ignored when the three baltic states were voted in to the nato club
3723104 despite the onset of proposed californian and european carbon dioxide mandates and the new 35 mpg us federal requirement coming in 2020 oems were struggling to promote stop start acceptance by consumers
3723105 recent design improvements have enabled progress toward volume production while fleet co 2 targets have encouraged car makers to pass on these economies of scale savings to consumers and to offer stop start as standard as on the bmw 1 series
3723106 by offering stop start on a wider range of models at higher volumes oems are able to reduce fuel consumption and harmful emissions much faster and at lower cost than by deploying mild and full hybrid powertrains on niche models these recent announcements represent a path forward for other car makers consumers who are taking advantage of lower taxation charged against low emitting models or have recently been hit hard by fuel price rises are now more aware of the value of stop start
3723107 that the thoughts prayers and support of the american people are with that great little nation as it struggles today
3723108 i told him that i know i speak for every american when i said to him today we are all georgians
3723109 the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world
3723110 now is the time for action not just words it is past time for the russian government to immediately sign and implement a cease fire russia must halt its violation of georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia with international monitors to verify that these obligations are met
3723111 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3723112 the georgians have agreed to a cease fire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3723113 the idea is to show the russians that it is no longer business as usual
3723114 we have been hearing from russia we dont want to stay
3723115 there are things you can do individually though to save energy
3723116 making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups youd actually save just as much
3723117 its hard for us to understand what the russian plan is
3723118 that support is aimed at encouraging the rise of georgia as an independent sovereign state
3723119 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3723120 she is attending and there was some sort of clerical error in which somebody said she was hosting but she is not
3723121 why did she allow barack obama to quietly list her as co host of a washington fundraiser at a tony restaurant in august because she thought louisianans might not notice
3723122 senators especially those running for re election dont get listed as fundraising co hosts for presidential candidates by accident
3723123 i can assure you that it had nothing to do with a kennedy e mail about it
3723124 no one in the democratic party would want to be publicly associated with him
3723125 he was raised as one of us the son of a mill worker he always said
3723126 fighting poverty and providing health care for everybody i hope those are still always his beliefs
3723127 you have to wonder when they look at what they consider a loophole with such excitement
3723128 that would suggest manipulating the process and i think opens the door to suspicion
3723129 the prospect of someone coming in with no id and registering and voting is contrary to every sort of protection that legislators and lawmakers have built into this system for decades
3723130 the processes and the law and the systems in our 88 counties are not equipped to handle same day registration
3723131 i will make it the law of the land when im president of the united states
3723132 is obama touched or tainted by this in any stretch of the imagination
3723133 i dont think he is at all lester you know if anything sure that they lose a good surrogate this was a guy who was very good on the stump
3723134 its a great moment of spontaneity and political manipulation all in one
3723135 bryan had a big opportunity but he missed it because he was afraid of losing his base
3723136 i think the bottom line is we lost focus we did and that focus is coming back
3723137 i think fundamentally our service is sound it doesnt mean were perfect and we certainly have work to do things to fix fences to mend
3723138 but still we want to continue talking to the chinese government
3723139 there is no proposal under consideration either publicly or privately for the episcopal diocese of fort worth to become part of the roman catholic church

3723141 his anti war posture might be attractive to obama but hes anathema to much of the progressive base of the democratic party
3723142 i think though it is impossible to predict with absolute confidence that the delegates would not deliver their votes unless at a minimum he switched political parties
3723143 hes not a good man when it comes to everything else and he hasnt voted well in any way shape or form that would gain any support from me or any other thinking democrat
3723144 hagel couldnt keep his mouth shut long enough to be somebodys no 2
3723145 its tough to be someones no 2 when youre used to making your own decisions
3723146 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
3723147 appear premature based on the facts and evidence that congressional investigators and the inspector general have uncovered so far
3723148 we must continue to pursue the truth and facts and hold any wrongdoers accountable
3723149 i have made repeatedly clear that it is neither permissible nor acceptable to consider political affiliations in the hiring of career department employees
3723150 there was a failure of supervision by senior officials in the department and there was a failure on the part of some employees to cry foul when they were aware or should have been aware of problems
3723151 even if it is true they didnt commit a crime it would be appropriate to make what they did a misdemeanor so that in the future those who violate the civil service laws cannot escape unscathed
3723152 rather pathetic how about you try and get a life
3723153 is vulnerable to adversaries who seek information about our nations homeland defense programs classified or unclassified
3723154 any real or possible contacts with foreign intelligence services terrorists or foreign criminal enterprises
3723155 the georgia crisis serves as a warning to countries such as ukraine and moldova that they should desist from petitioning for nato entry

3723173 states are increasingly adopting and implementing new energy policies as a result of high energy prices and increasing concern over global climate change
3723174 aceee seeks to provide a comprehensive survey of existing state best practices as a resource for policymakers businesses concerned citizens and others in the energy efficiency community
3723175 this web site builds on the extensive research regarding energy efficiency policies and programs for which aceee has become well known over the past 28 years
3723176 the database will serve as a portal to original aceee research as well as resources elsewhere on the web the unique resources include information on clean distributed generation policies and several utility policies including energy efficiency program funding and customer energy efficiency programs
3723177 the terrorist explosion directly targets the army and peaceful co existence in the country
3723178 the army and security forces will not be terrorised by attacks and crimes that target it and civil society and the history of the army attests to that
3723179 the investigation has begun and there are many interpretations political interpretations
3723180 syria staunchly denounces the criminal act perpetrated this morning in tripoli that killed many innocent civilians
3723181 aimed at complicating the security and political situation in lebanon and hampering the launch of the new government
3723182 intend to replace those rankings with an improved way to assess providers and their capabilities
3723183 they are sometimes the most important factor in determining which provider is selected to take on a project or deliver a software program
3723184 to continue to publish a high level view of key industry trends market size and providers and their capabilities in law technology news
3723185 we generally see about a 100 percent increase in recycling in mid to affluent neighborhoods
3723186 in lower income neighborhoods it can be up to 1 000 percent because the recycling rates are so low there
3723187 i am witnessing a huge column of russian vehicles coming out of gori on the road towards tbilisi there are something like 100 russian lorries support trucks and some armoured personnel carriers in a column that has taken something like 20 minutes to pass me
3723188 gori has been sealed off by russian troops i was able to get about a kilometre from the city until i got to a checkpoint manned by chechen troops who are under orders to stay there and have set up shooting positions
3723189 the ceasefire agreement specified that they were meant to go backwards they are clearly going forwards
3723190 ive been roughed up they dragged me pulled me and knocked me to the ground
3723191 i wonder how this fits in with their solemn promise to allow free and unrestricted reporting during the olympics
3723192 this was clearly a very ugly incident and is completely in contradiction to the assurances that the chinese made about media freedom during the olympics
3723193 i sincerely hope that it is not repeated and that the guarantees made will be consistently respected
3723194 we are very serious about the issue and are concerned that the media must be free to report on the olympic games we need to get the full facts
3723195 we intend to protest in the strongest possible terms to the chinese authorities and to seek assurances that the treatment meted out to mr ray will not be repeated
3723196 what i saw is the security guards were very rude to the reporters they pushed them i heard orders being shouted by the officers just use your hands they said get to the reporters and cover their camera lenses as a chinese person i feel bad
3723197 we call on the authorities to return his equipment apologise and investigate potential illegal action or abuse of authority by police
3723198 our proprietary methodology for developing specific growth and productivity traits will help any algal production system improve its output of inexpensive oil rich algae as the raw material for the generation of biofuel
3723199 we are extremely pleased to be working with allied minds in bringing a key component in biofuel production to the market were confident we have a superior technology that will now be in a better position to hit the ground running as the alternative energy market continues to mature
3723200 contrary to our predictions based on shorter follow up the absolute difference in cumulative incidence of distant metastasis and prostate cancer death did not further increase after seven years of follow up

3723204 dieser sonderlandtag ist leider nichts weiter als ein wahltaktisches ablenkungsman ver der vp die verzweifelt versucht von ihren sozialpolitischen defiziten abzulenken
3723205 f r den sonderlandtag bef rchte ich dass sich die beiden belastungs parteien sp und vp sinnlose schauk mpfe liefern werden und am ende f r die b rgerinnen nichts dabei herauskommt

3723220 geothermal energy has several advantages when compared to other renewable energy sources as well as carbon emitting fuels the sector is something to watch out for in the next few years
3723221 but where were the skeptical scientists politicians and journalists earlier when ethanol was first being promoted in congress
3723222 unintentional consequence of harming segments of our agriculture industry and contribute to higher food prices
3723223 after reviewing the facts it was clear this request did not meet the criteria in the law
3723224 the rfs remains an important tool in our ongoing efforts to reduce americas greenhouse gas emissions and lessen our dependence on foreign oil in aggressive yet practical ways
3723225 most economists now recognize the real severe economic harm is being done by the skyrocketing price of oil and not by ethanol production
3723226 in fact without ethanol production the damage from high oil prices would be even worse
3723227 biofuel ethanol was ballyhooed as a big win for u s energy security farmers and the environment but a funny thing happened on the way to the fuel tank suddenly many elected officials want to cut back on congressional mandates to produce far more ethanol the public is left wondering what happened
3723228 but where were the skeptical scientists politicians and journalists earlier when ethanol was first being promoted in congress
3723229 over the last year as weve seen some of the sentiment about the domestic ethanol industry shift we still see great support
3723230 americans realize that ethanol helps reduce gasoline prices and will help enhance our domestic energy security
3723231 were trying to educate americans that we can diversify the fuel mix lower gas prices and help build the ethanol industry in the u s
3723232 we can help lower grain prices further and create a bigger market for renewable fuels
3723233 the elimination of the secondary tariff assumes that we are in an under supply when actually the opposite is the case
3723234 bringing in more foreign ethanol will only make it harder to develop cellulosic ethanol because that industry which needs those early years of support to grow will be taken up by the foreign ethanol
3723235 leading solar and semiconductor manufacturers are increasingly looking to external resources to manage line performance and lower operating cost
3723236 ive just come from rugby league and the same thing has happened there the bigger guys find it harder with the elvs there is definitely a fitness element so its going to be interesting to see how over the next five to 10 years things develop
3723237 the last time i played rugby union i was about 118kgs this time ive come back and kept myself around 114kgs and ive found thats been a real bonus for my fitness levels theres no point going out on the park carrying anything extra
3723238 you obviously need to have the strength element and the size for scrummaging and other areas but you still have to be able to get around the pitch
3723239 bakkies brings a physical element to the game but they the springboks have brought in an absolute monster who is playing on his home ground and im sure its going to be a big moment for him
3723240 i think hes a real talent ive been really impressed with him
3723241 up until two years ago i didnt know his uncle had put together this gun for him
3723242 polly is amazing she has come through this situation fantastically she truly has strength and intelligence in tremendous quantities
3723243 i dont think she can tell you to this day how she did it
3723244 its a divine justice rather than the court justice my uncle deserved
3723245 i compare my present life situation to his and ask who won the answer is no contest me
3723246 i sat down and read the book at the beach and cried about half the time tears in my eyes
3723247 it really bothers me that anyone had to suffer like that
3723248 from the early 70s until the shooting happened every time they turned their back on him melvin it gave him more power each time
3723249 he actually ran the town he had more power than we did
3723250 he took a bullet protecting the town and for what the town should be ashamed for not taking care of him
3723251 what i saw that night wasnt right it always bothered me that nothing was ever done about it
3723252 take any small town in the united states if a police officer were to get shot in that town what would happen everything stops until the crime is solved that didnt happen in falmouth
3723253 once he was court captain i was out of the loop
3723254 once he became chief of police reports on my case began disappearing to the point that they are now virtually invisible
3723255 busby can think whatever he wants i was working the day shift when he got shot i dont know how the hell that would have anything to do with me
3723256 theres almost no one left and no one who was in control over what occurred back then
3723257 the implication is that the aging process is plastic and potentially amenable to intervention
3723258 we found a pretty striking reversal to that of the young skin
3723259 you might get a longer lifespan but at the expense of something else
3723260 everybody must be happy anybody not happy by noon tomorrow will be shot

3723311 the economy has been slowing since the middle of 2007 08 and growth will continue to ease as the recent rounds of policy tightening and the impact of recent currency appreciation continues to feed through
3723312 domestic demand will continue to drive growth in the short term supported by strengthening exports as this sector continues to gain competitiveness although short term gains may be more moderate owing to the weaker global economy

3723327 non andremo mai nel pdl e naturalmente lo diciamo ai camerati un po ingenui meno che mai nella destra di storace siamo e resteremo fiamma tricolore
3723328 leggere certe affermazioni da parte di un ormai ex dirigente nazionale fanno veramente pensare specialmente quando si al corrente che quello che stai dicendo non e assolutamente vero
3723329 la cosiddetta destra libertaria composta dagli stessi che avevano gi tradito in campagna elettorale lunica novit che a fare compagnia ai traditori la solita nipote assieme a un deputato europeo del partito di berlusconi

3723338 casa pound italia rappresenta al pieno tutte le nostre aspirazioni ideologiche politiche e per questo intendiamo seguire lesempio avanguardista delle occupazioni non conforme romane ci sentiamo di promettere sin da ora la nascita di un centro libraio non conforme e di una associazione culturale al fine di poter dare vita a progetti sociali e culturali al servizio della cittadinanza a partire dal prossimo ottobre

3723361 e ormai inprocastinabile oltre la convocazione dellesecutivo politico nazionale e lo chieder io stesso oggi al segretario nazionale storace per chiarire le affermazioni della nostra portavoce santanche pubblicate oggi sui quotidiani nazionali

3723365 c stata fumata bianca si va ha spiegato verso un pdl equilibrato e coeso
3723366 an ha il 30 di rappresentanti mentre forza italia il 70 che include per anche i partiti minori in modo da realizzare velocemente questo percorso
3723367 nel percorso verso la nascita del pdl fermo restando quanto stabilito nel documento di intesa tra berlusconi e fini di febbraio 2008 in un incontro con il presidente berlusconi il ministro la russa e lonorevole verdini al quale stato invitato anche il segretario della dca gianfranco rotondi si proceduto a definire un comitato costituente del pdl che oltre ai promotori an e fi vedr la partecipazione di tutti i soggetti che hanno gi dato vita a liste comuni a camera e senato
3723368 in particolare scritto nella nota nellorganismo presieduto da verdini e la russa in cui an sar rappresentata al 30 dei partecipanti saranno rappresentate oltre ovviamente a forza italia tutte le formazioni politiche che gi fanno parte dei gruppi parlamentari comuni del pdl e stata fissata per il 10 settembre la riunione del comitato costituente a roma mentre per il 18 agosto la prima riunione della commissione statuto che dovr redigere la bozza di regole comuni del pdl
3723369 il voto conferito a un partito utile quando viene utilizzato per il fine per il quale stato conferito inutile quando non viene utilizzato per il fine per il quale stato conferito dannoso quando viene utilizzato per il fine opposto a quello per il quale stato conferito votare per il mio partito utile perch il mio partito chiede voti per lopposizione a tutti i livelli e li utilizza per lopposizione a tutti i livelli lei da buon democratico mi insegna che in democrazia lopposizione tanto importante quanto il governo a condizione che si tratti di una vera opposizione e non di una sceneggiata come quella che in questo momento recitano le false opposizioni che dicono di combattere il governo e i partiti di governo ma la tempo stesso lottizzano con il governo e i partiti di governo le posizioni di potere quanto al frigorifero noi manteniamo intatti i voti che riceviamo perch li utilizziamo con fedelt e coerenza e non ce ne serviamo per baratti di alcun genere
3723370 io penso e affermo che fuori dalla vera legittimit costituzionale si pongono quei partiti che rifiutano di attivare gli articoli sociali della costituzione 39 40 e 46 che interpretano in maniera distorta larticolo 49 e dal pluralismo fanno nascere il mostro che si chiama partitocrazia penso e affermo che fuori della costituzione siano quei partiti che lottizzano in termini di potere e quindi di arbitrio la libert di informazione attraverso il mezzo radio televisivo le chiedo anche se abbia avuto modo di conoscere i lineamenti del sistema da noi posto in alternativa presidente della repubblica eletto direttamente dal popolo presidente del consiglio e ministri nominati dal presidente della repubblica senza forcipe di partiti e senza manuali cencelli parlamento eletto direttamente e pluralisticamente ma con la partecipazione di rappresentanze elette delle categorie del mondo del lavoro della produzione della tecnica della cultura e dellarte tutto questo solo idealismo se fosse ne sarei orgoglioso ma io sono fiero di ben altro isolato nei confronti di un paese legale sempre pi lontano dal paese reale ho lorgoglio di essere sempre pi vicino alle esigenze alle speranze e quindi alla comprensione del paese reale cio del popolo italiano
3723371 che strana domanda dottor montanelli ma come pu saltarle in mente visto che lei un uomo che crede nella libert che il segretario di un partito possa dissolvere il suo partito e possa addirittura dopo averlo dissolto farne confluire i voti in altre direzioni centinaia di migliaia di iscritti e almeno due milioni di elettori ma in questo momento siamo di pi dovrebbero obbedire al dittatore almirante per accettare da un momento allaltro di dissolversi e poi di confluire dissolversi cio scomparire come fatto politico come fatto di coscienza come fatto morale come fatto di impegno fisico e spirituale confluire cio abbracciare unaltra fede unaltra dottrina un altro e molto diverso credo politico rinnegando dun colpo se stessi

3723400 due to the complete lack of sales of bulk properties with large buildings similar to the subject the cost approach will be utilized to estimate the value of the subject property because of the subjects somewhat unusual features such as geo thermal heat and finished living area some reliance has been placed on the contracted prices
3723401 the subject improvements are a combination living area work shop and as such have a questionable market appeal because they are somewhat unusual
3723402 although there is no straight forward market data to indicate the precise amount of functional obsolescence depreciation due to these factors it is the appraisers conclusion that it should be substantial and that a charge of 50 of the building cost should be made

3723459 prince charles has got a way of getting things absolutely wrong
3723460 its an entirely luddite attitude to simply reject them out of hand
3723461 in some developing countries where for instance there is a problem with drought or salinity if you can develop salt or drought resistant crops there are great benefits
3723462 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand
3723463 gm crops will not solve the food crisis and forging ahead with an industrialised farming system will continue to fail people and the environment around the world
3723464 condemn millions of people to starvation in areas like sub saharan africa
3723465 the reality is that without the development of science in farming we would not be able to feed a tenth of the world population which will exceed nine billion by 2050
3723466 if we go down this path i think we will put this country at risk there could be a period of great difficulty in the next 10 or 20 years
3723467 no evidence has emerged from the first round of gm crops of any public benefits they have actually increased pesticide use in the farms that have used them
3723468 theres no evidence of any health problems to human being talk of that has disappeared there was a great deal of excitement in america a few years ago that some butterfly was going to disappear due to use of gm foods this butterfly i understand is still flapping around quite happily
3723469 prince charles should stick to his royal role rather than spout off about something which he has clearly got wrong scientists and others who have looked at the problem have found no solid evidence that gm crops affect peoples health
3723470 we have to move to a more sustainable agriculture and reduce emissions
3723471 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3723472 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through

3723683 even though the economy contracted in april june it would be more accurate to think that it wont last long
3723684 we cant expect export growth to accelerate any time soon
3723685 but we can probably avoid a full fledged recession as in several straight quarters of gdp contraction we still expect the bank of japans next policy move to be a rate hike but it wont come for the rest of this year
3723686 though prices are soaring our salaries dont rise our nation as a whole is demoralized
3723687 this study reports the first regional scale assessment of aerosol effects on plant productivity and surface energy fluxes over the eastern united states analysis is conducted using an established modeling framework which is composed of a regional land surface model regional daily aerosol optical depth aod estimates and meteorological forcings the sensitivity experiments were conducted from may to september in 2000 and 2001 over the eastern united states with and without the aerosol light scattering effect results show that the aerosol light scattering effect results in enhanced productivity for high lai and optimum temperature environments under cloudless sky conditions around noon while it results in least productive for low lai low temperature environments under cloud sky conditions in early morning or late afternoon as a result domain averaged plant productivities measured as net primarily production are changed by 0 71 g c m 2 0 09 in 2000 and 5 00 g c m 2 0 5 in 2001 these responses of plant productivity and photosynthesis to the aerosol light scattering effect uniquely modulate the surface flux as follows the aerosol light scattering effect reduces the surface downwelling solar radiation 14 9 w m 2 in 2000 and 16 0 w m 2 in 2001 and net radiation in vegetation canopy but simultaneously increases the photosynthesis and stomatal conductance consequently surface latent heat flux transpiration and evaporation is reduced by a small amount particularly over the forests while aerosol loading often results in larger reduction in the sensible heat flux for the whole domain latent heat flux is changed by 3 10 w m 2 2 1 in 2000 and 3 12 w m 2 2 1 in 2001 sensible heat flux is changed by 7 57 w m 2 12 9 in 2000 and 8 36 w m 2 11 3 in 2001 and surface skin temperature is changed by 0 25 k 0 1 in 2000 and 0 27 k 0 1 in 2001

3723715 for the mystic god was neither an unspeakable secret to be passed over in silence nor a dissipated secret that had been laid bare in revelation rather the mystic approached god as a secret which one was compelled to share yet which retained its secrecy the union can be articulated like this that which we cannot speak of is the one thing about whom and to whom we must never stop speaking
3723716 as a first step it is long past time for the senate to pass the broadband data improvement act s 1492 which would improve our nations broadband data collection and provide funding to states for public private partnerships to increase broadband deployment and adoption
3723717 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
3723718 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl cable modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country

3723727 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3723728 i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here
3723729 russia has much more to lose than the soviet union had to lose in 1968
3723730 russia has one foot in integration into the international economy and community of states and one foot that is not quite in
3723731 russia is going to have to assure its integration into the wto and the oecd and the g8 and institutions like that
3723732 to undermine our relations to curtail our relations we might as well let the united states deal on its own with some of the issues
3723733 it is hard to imagine that georgian president mikheil saakashvili embarked on this risky venture without some sort of approval from the side of the united states
3723734 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3723735 has a responsibility to follow through its promise to halt the attacks and remove russian troops from the country

3723740 they beat me like a dog political persecution of opposition activists and supporters in zimbabwe
3723741 describes ongoing abuses including killings beatings and arbitrary arrests by zanu pf and its allies against mdc members of parliament activists and supporters before and after the june 27 presidential run off election
3723742 the government has made little effort to dismantle the torture camps and bases established by zanu pf and its allies since the first round of elections on march 29
3723743 zanu pf and its allies are still committing violent abuses undermining the partys credibility as a political partner
3723744 instead of focusing on quick political fixes president thabo mbeki and other sadc leaders should look for a durable solution and that means first of all an immediate end to human rights violations
3723745 the presence of torture camps and of armed zanu pf supporters militias and war veterans highlights the precarious nature of the human rights situation in zimbabwe
3723746 the ongoing tragedy has been exacerbated by an increasingly dire humanitarian situation
3723747 severe government restrictions on the distribution of humanitarian assistance including food aid by local and international agencies have had a devastating impact on people in the rural areas of zimbabwe
3723748 according to the world food programme an estimated five million people are in need of food aid in the past four months zanu pf and its allies have been implicated in the killing of at least 163 people and the beating and torture of more than 5 000 others
3723749 thirty two of these people were killed after the june 27 run off and two since zanu pf and the mdc signed a memorandum of understanding that paved the way for negotiations
3723750 i am an old woman and they beat me like a dog no a wild animal
3723751 i regret being alive my life is ruined my home is destroyed and my sons life was taken in cold blood
3723752 police have taken little or no action to investigate abuses of the kind documented in this report with few investigations or prosecutions of serious crimes committed by zanu pf and its allies since the march elections and little legal redress or compensation for the victims
3723753 there can be no trade off between the political process and the need for justice and an end to human rights abuses said gagnon
3723754 the zimbabwean governments refusal to account for serious crimes will only damage the prospects for political stability in zimbabwe
3723755 sadc leaders can make a difference by insisting that abusers be held to account under any political deal
3723756 abuse of young girls and in some cases boys by at least 100 indian peacekeepers about a period of several years
3723757 reiterates in the strongest possible terms that such behaviour if substantiated is wholly unacceptable
3723758 should be taken as soon as possible against those found to be involved in such misconduct
3723759 that the allegations will be promptly and thoroughly investigated and if proven strict and exemplary action would be taken as per the law
3723760 highly values indias long standing and valuable support for united nations peacekeeping
3723761 his respect for all those peacekeepers from india and other troop contributing countries who serve with honor and commitment
3723762 the misconduct of a few should not diminish the enormous contribution and sacrifice of the large number of blue helmets who serve the cause of peace
3723763 the conditions for free and fair elections start long before election day
3723764 less than a month before elections its clear angolans arent able to campaign free from intimidation or pressure and unless things change now angolans wont be able to cast their votes freely
3723765 failing to fully ensure the right to free elections and other rights critical to a fair poll including the freedoms of expression and of assembly
3723766 major areas of concern include the governments obligations to safeguard freedom of assembly and expression and access to the media by all stakeholders and to establish an impartial national electoral body
3723767 the government has also failed to provide adequate security to political parties participating in elections and to ensure political tolerance and full participation of citizens
3723768 talks will never collapse as long as we have tongues
3723769 it is a result of the alert vigilant and patriotic manner they have conducted their day to day duties

3723777 enacting a property tax cap is a good starting point but it is only one piece of the puzzle
3723778 a tax cap is a gimmick that does nothing to lower property taxes for hard pressed new yorkers

3723825 we think we have a pretty good handle on the situation we thought we were relatively conservative but well see how it goes

3723827 why some of the application doesnt need whole target path

3723844 a very keenly intellectually engaged woman shes very insistent upon rigorous dialogue
3723845 i guess more than anything its a little bit annoying that weve been made the scapegoat when you consider how much money we receive relative to the budget for the entire program
3723846 i think our funding comes in at something less than 0 1 per cent of the whole program
3723847 so all of these other larger groups who need money more than we do to travel abroad like ballet and symphonies we become the scapegoat for the cutting in their funding

3723885 three goals in two games i think it shows one of the reasons why we brought him to the football club
3723886 hell be a tremendous asset from us and were delighted to have him
3723887 i always felt as a striker if you get in amongst the goals they always seem to follow you always get runs of goals
3723888 hes a great lad he knows where the goals are and his terrific
3723889 aside from his goals the thing i loved about him is his work rate and that was one of the biggest reasons for signing him
3723890 there will be times that it doesnt come off from him but you can never fault the work rate hes got and thats what i want to see in the burnley jersey and hopefully that rubs off on other players and we get the same passion and work rate from everybody in that top

3723907 ultimately aviation is a very very safe way to travel

3723909 whats driving this is that a lot of our customers try to support the application on their own
3723910 and its an application just like oracle apps are applications it needs to change and alter with the company their processes change and it also needs to keep up with salesforce com updates
3723911 if they have a lot of stuff going on from different parties itll get more expensive

3723913 customers have a mentality of wanting one throat to choke
3723914 they want to talk to one person for their support and maybe that person then has to go to many other people for the answer
3723915 the flexibility of these solutions whether its microsoft crm or salesforce com is that even an educated power user can really get a project in trouble
3723916 our consultants are in the trenches with the client and help with enhancements but also in terms of pure support we have the backup of microsoft
3723917 we started in license only sales and that has morphed into services and managed services and now we have a hosting business as well
3723918 whats driving this is that a lot of our customers try to support the application on their own
3723919 and its an application just like oracle apps are applications it needs to change and alter with the company their processes change and it also needs to keep up with salesforce com updates
3723920 if they have a lot of stuff going on from different parties itll get more expensive
3723921 we have to educate people on the support side because salesforce com is so easy to alter and play with that a lot of companies take it on themselves

3723928 our state government is in really bad shape right now it affects everything not just the immigrant initiative
3723929 at least theres a clear agenda that we can rally around
3723930 its important for everyone to be upfront that theres not likely to be any funding for these initiatives anytime soon
3723931 everybody now is hurting for money that doesnt mean that crafting recommendations and policy isnt productive
3723932 i dont see things magically happening but i think its laying a good solid foundation for the future
3723933 there are lots of services you dont know exist and you dont know how to take advantage of them
3723934 if i have tax dollars going anywhere its going to be for seniors and veterans who built this country
3723935 we are doing what other states are going to have to be doing one day

3723951 i think its an absolutely amazing institution with such vast historic resources that need to be stewarded as well as possible but it also is serving its community with 27 branches
3723952 the branches are the heart of any library system one of my goals would be to have the branch libraries as vibrant as possible
3723953 the community library system is something that im just passionate about
3723954 from the point of view of the library boston has it all
3723955 and then of course theres the city boston both my parents are from boston although ive never lived in boston its always been part of my heritage
3723956 ultimately that decision is made by the attorney general of the united states
3723957 the reason weve been appointed in this case is it carries a potential death sentence it doesnt mean its going to be a death penalty case one of our functions will be to try to marshal reasons to the government why the death penalty shouldnt become an issue
3723958 the reason im sure the federal defenders appointed attorneys with death penalty expertise is that they believe its likely that the feds will in fact seek the death penalty in the case when charges are ultimately filed
3723959 its really important that the criminal defendants have attorneys with competence in death penalty cases because they are very difficult they encompass a whole range of issues that are not present in cases in which the death penalty is not at issue
3723960 i know that its affected peoples lives and that the vast majority of people caught up in that process were good people
3723961 my impression truly is that they are trying to do the best that they can do
3723962 if theyre really interested in people becoming citizens they should make the process easier
3723963 the thought of taking part in this adventure has kept me hopeful the stories of the other women who have taken part have made me feel less alone
3723964 all the medical procedures and treatments are wonderful but they have saved my life but cancer has attacked my confidence and left me frightened
3723965 i need to shake my fist at the sky and show breast cancer that it cannot stop me
3723966 i need my adventure because i havent felt brave or in control of anything for so long
3723967 this disease can cripple women by making them live scared the work of amazon heart will help me keep the cancer in its place and not let it ruin the life that medicine has saved for me
3723968 as terrifying as the diagnosis and treatments were i have been really impressed by the spirit of fellow survivors
3723969 this disease can happen to young women at a time when they have careers that are important to them mortgages to pay and young children to support
3723970 so far my treatments have been successful and my health is good i know i have been very lucky

3723999 the research shows that lung cancer related media coverage in ireland is seriously disproportionate to the incidence of and mortality from the disease and supports the long held theory evident in other countries that there is a lack of interest in the media in lung cancer
3724000 lung cancer does not receive the attention afforded to other major cancers
3724001 driving awareness of the devastating impact of lung cancer has to be a top priority
3724002 lung cancer has been the poor relation for too long and we need to work with the media to bring attention to advances in research treatment and services for people with lung cancer
3724003 while lung cancer appears to receive more attention than prostate cancer on the surface coverage is scant when references to lung cancer in the context of smoking issues are removed
3724004 the vast majority of lung cancer coverage in the print media is overshadowed and defined by tobacco related issues and does not focus on explaining signs and symptoms of lung cancer to promote early detection highlighting advances in research and treatment and presenting stories of hope and survival
3724005 as a very conservative estimate we calculate that approximately one third of lung cancer coverage analysed in our research was primarily about smoking matters
3724006 our team keeps a very tight schedule and the athletic and academic success of this group has been remarkable we also improved our overall team gpa to a 3 3 and have set a goal to reach a team gpa of 3 5 after the 2009 season
3724007 i know i speak for every american when i said to him today we are all georgians
3724008 the clintons know that a lot of democrats are muttering that their solipsistic behavior is disgusting but theyre too filled with delicious schadenfreude at the wave of buyers remorse that has swept the democratic party many democrats are questioning whether obama is fighting back hard enough against mccain and many are wondering given his inability to open up a lead in a country fed up with republicans if race will be an insurmountable factor
3724009 the sight of russian tanks rolling into parts of a sovereign country on its neighbouring borders will have brought a chill down the spine of many people rightly
3724010 that is a reversion to not just cold war politics it is a nineteenth century way of doing politics i think it is very very important at a european level but also at the un that we assert that that is simply not the way in which international relations can be run in the 21st century
3724011 there are any number of opportunities for russia to reverse course and to demonstrate that it is trying to behave according to 21st century principles
3724012 they have destroyed buildings there has been looting by russian troops they were shooting people
3724013 neither russian peacekeepers nor any units subordinate to them are present in gori
3724014 georgian forces have begun their pull back toward tbilisi but no active withdrawal has yet been observed
3724015 in the wake of this conflict there is no way that we can proceed with this joint exercise at this time
3724016 i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here
3724017 the aggressive russian force beyond south ossetian borders has been something that really shocked many people
3724018 the sight of russian tanks in gori russian tanks in senaki russian blockade of poti the georgian port are a chilling reminder of times that i think we had hoped had gone by
3724019 it immediately became clear that in fact the confrontation was hardly finished
3724020 it is too early to reach unequivocal conclusions about whether the agreement reached by president dmitry medvedev and sarkozy will really put an end to military actions in south ossetia
3724021 saakashvili is characterised by his unpredictability and a lack of willingness to respect agreements
3724022 while tibetan song and dance is on display in beijing in tibet our culture is under siege and our people are being forcibly kept from speaking out about their repression at the hands of the chinese authorities
3724023 the ioc has learned through media reports that a british journalist was allegedly assaulted today while covering a demonstration near an olympic venue in beijing
3724024 the iocs position is clear the media must be free to report on the olympic games
3724025 the tank crew was unable to determine the nature of the object mounted on the tripod and positively identify it as an anti tank missile a mortar or a television camera
3724026 in light of the reasonable conclusion reached by the tank crew and its superiors that the characters were hostile and were carrying an object most likely to be a weapon the decision to fire at the targets was sound
3724027 there is no doubt that fadel shanas death is a tragedy
3724028 a journalist in action was killed by idf fire along with others not involved in the hostilities
3724029 however the available evidence does not suggest misconduct or criminal misbehaviour i have therefore decided that no further legal measures will be taken
3724030 im extremely disappointed that this report condones a disproportionate use of deadly force in a situation the army itself admitted had not been analysed clearly
3724031 they would appear to take the view that any raising of a camera into position could garner a deadly response
3724032 these findings mean that a journalist with a camera is at risk of coming under fire and theres not that much that can be done
3724033 i just want to sit down and have some hennessy
3724034 if two years ago i came there the people shout at me

3724040 below the sanctuary in the fellowship hall a banner for slavery reparations proclaimed they owe us fliers recounted herbert daughtrys arrest a few weeks earlier as he led marchers protesting the not guilty verdict in the police killing of sean bell an unarmed black man his ministry has always combined consuming spirituality with black liberation theology the theology jeremiah wright invoked this spring to defend his controversial sermons and zealous political activism leah holds these forces within her
3724041 while the media hounded wright for his anti american rants and while presidential hopeful sen barack hussein obama divorced him as his personal pastor obamas head will be crowned by leah daughtry who ardently believes in the same marxist black liberation theology preached by wright
3724042 there is something incongruous about the stretch of beach just under the hilton hotels high perch for there below the bluff are two so called specialty beaches the hassidic beach surrounded by an eight foot concrete wall features a polite sign at its entrance sundays tuesdays and thursdays are womens bathing days it announces mondays wednesdays and fridays belong to men its the municipalitys solution to the ultra orthodox dilemma of how to body surf without breaking the halachic jewish law prohibition on unmarried members of the opposite sex seeing one another in immodest dress at the beach directly adjacent to the walled compound every day is mens bathing day this is the unofficial gay beach
3724043 when the war on drugs succeeds and cocaine prices rise you dont see the drug czar proposing government subsidies for addicts i dont like his mission but at least hes honest on this point hes not out there disrupting supplies one day and then helping addicts pay for their fixes the next the same cant be said however of warriors on oil addiction consider green businessman joseph p kennedy ii his nonprofit citizens energy corporation pushes an environmentalist agenda of reduced energy use wind power and carbon offsets but it also has a campaign of giving discount heating oil to the poor and elderly you might have seen its ads on tv such as the one where a poverty stricken mother and child freezing in their unheated home is saved by joe and his delivery truck bringing them oil at 40 percent off but why is joe bringing them oil at all let alone cheap oil shouldnt he be bringing them solar panels or manuals on energy conservation or perhaps a gold star for this familys low carbon footprint
3724044 some of our parliamentarians have been getting a bit too much sun during their summer holidays thats the only explanation for the discussion by some opposition mps about the possible introduction of a knife registry following the gruesome fatal attack on a greyhound bus passenger late last month a knife registry really what would i have to declare paring knives a bread knife the plastic knife i used to put tuna on crackers while i was having lunch at work the other day most knives are sharp that helps them serve their purpose you know to cut things there would be no way to single out knives that are used for hunting and ones used to cut chicken for that stir fry youre making for dinner or ones used to say kill people im not going to say the gun registry has turned out well but i think theres a need to register firearms
3724045 why should the german be interested in the liberation of the jew if the jew is not interested in the liberation of the german we recognize in judaism therefore a general anti social element of the present time in the final analysis the emancipation of the jews is the emancipation of mankind from judaism indeed in north america the practical domination of judaism over the christian world has achieved as its unambiguous and normal expression that the preaching of the gospel itself and the christian ministry have become articles of trade money is the jealous god of israel in face of which no other god may exist

3724048 there is nothing more painful to me at this stage in my life than to walk down the street and hear footsteps and start thinking about robbery then look around and see somebody white and feel relieved

3724065 in their principles from which they proceed gospel mortification is from gospel principles viz the spirit of god rom 8 13 if ye through the spirit mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live faith in christ acts 15 9 purifying their hearts by faith the love of christ constraining 2 cor 5 14 the love of christ constraineth us but legal mortification is from legal principles such as from the applause and praise of men as in the pharisees from pride of self righteousness as in paul before his conversion from the fear of hell from a natural conscience from the example of others from some common motions of the spirit and many times from the power of sin itself while one sin is set up to wrestle with another as when sensuality and self righteousness wrestle with one another the man perhaps will not drink and swear why because he is setting up and establishing a righteousness of his own whereby to obtain the favour of god here is but one sin wrestling with another

3724088 it is past time for the russian government to immediately sign and implement a cease fire russia must halt its violation of georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia with international monitors to verify that these obligations are met

3724100 now if somebody wants to sue us they have an option to sue but im fairly certain that a judge will see it the way the way the citizens see it here
3724101 the citizens deserve peace that some infringement on constitutional rights is ok and we have not violated anything as far as the sits among abandoned homes and occupied residences in disrepair

3724120 even the airport security guy in canada asked me so is it true
3724121 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3724122 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3724123 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3724124 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3724125 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3724126 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3724127 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3724128 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3724129 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3724130 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3724131 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3724132 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3724133 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3724134 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3724135 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3724136 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3724137 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3724138 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3724139 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3724140 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3724141 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3724142 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3724143 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3724144 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3724145 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3724146 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3724147 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3724148 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3724149 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3724150 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3724151 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3724152 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3724153 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base

3724158 by better understanding audiences kidcare tv will be better able to compete with traditional media developing metrics on engagement and consumer experience will provide advertisers with audience delivery validation for improved return on investment
3724159 in my experience when a player had the option of choosing an ointment on the shelf in the training room they would always choose sro the neosporin and triple antibiotic ointment would be still on the shelf virtually unused at the end of the season
3724160 sro is the only topical ointment that not only heals the sores i get from my prosthesis faster but the pain is diminished
3724161 in three to five years the otto bock business in romania could amount to 4 5 million given the market potential and the evolution on other eastern european markets where the company has opened branches
3724162 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3724163 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3724164 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3724165 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3724166 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3724167 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3724168 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3724169 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3724170 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3724171 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3724172 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3724173 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3724174 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3724175 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3724176 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3724177 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3724178 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

3724182 i wish i had the luxury of focusing on the tastier bits of my career but theres not much you can turn down as long as you can do it and it pays well
3724183 its why i keep branching out getting more work and that leverages into more work it doesnt matter where you live except for making personal connections but i can get to new york and toronto and those places the cost of living here is so much more reasonable and i have the luxury of the opportunity to invest in my own keys to success
3724184 everything is an outgrowth of my career each part tends to reinforce the other one informs the other i end up with a greater skill set than if id specialized

3724191 well shop it first to the travel channel then to bourdains production company well work our way down to public access
3724192 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3724193 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3724194 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3724195 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3724196 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3724197 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3724198 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3724199 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3724200 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3724201 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3724202 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3724203 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3724204 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3724205 who are open to doing something on the production side
3724206 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3724207 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3724208 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3724209 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3724210 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3724211 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3724212 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3724213 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3724214 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3724215 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3724216 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3724217 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3724218 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3724219 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3724220 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3724221 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3724222 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3724223 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3724224 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3724225 jika keinginanku tercapai tentulah aku bahagia dan senang selamanya dan jika tidak tercapai tentulah aku celaka dan susah selamanya
3724226 jika usahaku untuk mencari pinjaman ini tidak berhasil pastilah aku celaka dan merasa malu selamanya
3724227 bila aku dapat membeli sarung baru pasti aku akan bahagia yakni tetap senang pada hari besar nanti aku dapat melancong ke mana mana
3724228 memang meskipun sarungnya sudah baru ikat kepalanya pun harus baru
3724229 sekarang sarung dan ikat kepalanya sudah baru dan bagaimanakah bajunya tidakkah harus baru pula
3724230 sekarang semua barang sudah baru mengapa isterinya masih yang lama saja agar tidak dikatakan aneh maka ia mencari isteri baru
3724231 anaknya pun harus ada yang baru karena mengapa yang ada hanya anak dari isteri lama saja
3724232 jika aku berpenghasilan tiap bulan sepuluh rupiah saja aku tentu bahagia tidak seperti sekarang ini kadang kadang hanya tiga rupiah bahkan kadang kadang juga rugi
3724233 ternyata penghasilan sepuluh rupiah ini tidak membuat aku bahagia jika berpenghasilan dua puluh ima rupiah barulah aku akan benar benar bahagia
3724234 kalau aku hanya menerima dua puluh lima rupiah saja terang tidak mungkin aku bahagia bahkan hal itu akan menambah banyak hutangnya karena dipercaya untuk membeli dengan bon hingga ke sana ke sini aku membuat bon hanya jika aku berpenghasilan seratus rupiah baru aku benar benar bahagia
3724235 ternyata menjadi raja dari semua raja itu tidak membuat aku bahagia karena memerintah manusia itu ternyata bukan main banyak kesulitannya
3724236 mungkin kalau menjadi raja jin barulah aku benar benar bahagia
3724237 kalau hanya dapat menyembuhkan orang lumpuh dengan meniupnya saja aku tidak berbahagia akan tetapi kalau dapat menghidupkan orang mati aku tentu bahagia karena siapapun akan percaya segan takut kepadaku dan akan memujaku
3724238 celakalah aku nanti jika setiap orang mati kuhidupkan kembali mayat mayat dari mana mana pasti akan dibawa kemari semua dan aku disuruh menghidupkannya halaman rumahku pasti akan penuh dengan bangkai anjing babi hutan dan lain lain mungkin kalau aku dapat mengeluarkan sukma dari badan aku baru benar benar bahagia aku akan dapat melayang layang mengelilingi dunia melihat negeri belanda negeri cina tanpa melakukan perjalanan tanpa susah payah lagi pula tidak kehilangan uang untuk bekalnya
3724239 susahlah aku bila sukma yang acapkali dilepas itu sampai tidak dapat kembali lagi ke tempat asalnya namun manakala aku bisa menghilang pastilah aku betul betul bahagia aku akan dapat menggaruk uang di pasar pasar tanpa diketahui pemiliknya dan tiap kata ada orang sedang menghitung uang uang itu kuambil dengan tidak usah bekerja aku dapat memiliki banyak uang dan apa pun kuhendaki pastilah tercapai
3724240 walaupun syarat pilihanku tidak terpenuhi semua asal saja cantik wajahnya bolehlah
3724241 sebaiknya kucari uang sebanyak banyaknya agar menjadi kaya seperti orang itu dan jangan sampai miskin seperti orang ini agar bisa mengejek orang ini dan jangan sampai diejek orang itu dan kuharus memperoleh derajat yang luhur supaya mulia seperti orang itu dan jangan sampai hina seperti orang ini sehingga terhormat seperti orang itu dan tidak diremehkan seperti orang ini harus kucari kramat kekuasaan yang besar supaya berkuasa dan dapat menaklukkan orang itu jangan sampai lemah dan ditaklukkan orang ini
3724242 bagaimana kyai hidupku ini mengapa senantiasa susah apakah memang nasibku harus dibenci orang bagaimana baiknya
3724243 sanggupkah anda bertapa secara ditanam selama empat puluh hari itu memang berat tetapi bila dikurniakan tentu nasibmu akan lebih baik
3724244 baiklah saya bersedia ditanam asal dapat kurnia andaikata aku gagal dan mati itu pun justru lebih baik dari pada hidup sekali saja menjadi buah ejekan tetangga tetangga kesana diejek kesini diejek
3724245 kyai jika penguburan diriku ditangguhkan saja sampai setelah tanggal dua saja bagaimana
3724246 baik sekalipun aku kalah asal saja tetanggaku itu hidupnya merana maka senanglah hatiku
3724247 sesungguhnya si anu itu kan sudah payah betul lihat saja surat gadainya sudah daluwarsa pohon pohon kelapanya sudah digadaikan dan ia hanya kebagian yang hanya cukup untuk dimakannya sendiri
3724248 lihat si anu itu akhirnya celaka karena tidak mau percaya padaku tidak mau meniru jejakku tentu saja celaka
3724249 tidak heran si anu itu kaya karena bukan main kikirnya bila ia buang air kedapatan kacang kedele dalam kotorannya maka kedele itu dikorekinya dari kotorannya
3724250 benar benar aku menderita bila tidak memiliki sepeda kalau barang barang lainnya tidak kuhiraukan
3724251 tidak heran si anu itu memiliki sepeda karena hidupnya tidak lumrah lazim bermuka tebal lain dengan aku ini yang tidak tega hati menyikut orang
3724252 kalau si anu itu memang senang hidupnya makannya terjamin tiga kali sehari sepiring penuh lauk pauknya enak enak berganti ganti telur daging lain dengan diriku ini serba celaka makannya tidak menentu lauk pauknya tidak lain tidak hanya garam sambel paling mujur tempe bila ingin daging ayam hanya mendapat pekerjaan membubuti mencabuti bulunya dan membersihkan isi perutnya
3724253 lho bagaimana ini orang mau makan kok menggerutu makannya enak atau tidak jika enak teruskanlah jika tidak enak hentikanlah
3724254 si anu itu hidupnya memang enak lantaran mempunyai suami isteri yang menyenangkan perhatiannya besar lagi setia lain dengan diriku ini serba celaka mempunyai suami isteri rewel sekali sedikit dikit marah sedikit dikit marah
3724255 o bagaimana ini orang bersuami isteri kok mengomel sesungguhnya perkawinannya enak atau tidak jika enak diteruskan jika tidak enak ya diceraikan saja
3724256 orang hidup itu harus begini makannya harus begini pakaiannya harus begini rumahnya harus begini tindak tanduk terhadap tetangga suami isteri serta anak anaknya harus begini
3724257 lho bagaimana langkahku ini mau datang takut mau tidak datang pun takut apakah harus setengah datang dan setengah tidak datang lalu bagaimana wujud tindakan setengah datang dan setengah tidak datang itu apakah melongok longok di depan pagar saja ataukah terus menerobos masuk ke dapur membantu cuci piring
3724258 sudahlah jika mau datang ya datang saja jika tidak mau datang ya tidak usah datang biia tidak punya pakaian baru pakailah pakaian lama hal itu sudah sebenarnya bila tidak punya uang maka tidak dapat menyumbang dan main domino pun sudah selayaknya
3724259 andaikata dulu aku bertindak demikian bahagialah sudah aku ini tidaklah celaka begini
3724260 walaupun dulu bagaimana saja pasti rasanya sebentar senang sebentar susah
3724261 dulu andaikata aku tidak terkutuk oleh si anu tidak durhaka tentu aku sudah bahagia dan tidak celaka
3724262 walaupun dulu terkutuk durhaka atau tidak durhaka rasanya tentu sebentar senang sebentar susah
3724263 andaikata dulu tidak menjadi anak ibu dan ayah ini pasti aku bahagia dan tidak celaka seperti ini
3724264 walaupun dulu menjadi anak ibu ayah ini atau tidak tentu rasanya sebentar senang sebentar susah
3724265 andaikata dulu aku tidak salah memperoleh suami isteri dan anak si kunyuk si dogol itu pastilah aku bahagia dan tidaklah celaka
3724266 walaupun dulu aku mempunyai suami isteri dan anak seperti kunyuk kunyuk itu atau tidak rasaku tentu sebentar senang sebentar susah
3724267 bagaimanakah nanti akhirnya bila aku tidak mencapai kebahagiaan yang kucita citakan tetapi tetap celaka seperti sekarang ini
3724268 walaupun kelak akan terjadi apa saja misalkan bumi dan langit merapat rasanya pasti sebentar senang sebentar susah
3724269 mana ada orang kuwalat atau durhaka kalau toh ada rasanya pasti hanya sebentar senang sebentar susah katanya orang kuwalat itu kepalanya di bawah dan kakinya di atas kalau begitu malah bisa merasakannya sebab yang sudah dialami berpuluh puluh tahun hidup dengan kepala di atas dan kaki di bawah ternyata tidak enak seperti pada waktu cekcok dengan suami isterinya atau tetangganya lihatlah orang orang dengan kepala di atas kaki di bawah itu
3724270 bagaimana mungkin orang mati itu tersesat kalau tersesat tentu ke arah hidup yang pernah dialami ini lagi pula jika ada mati tersesat tentu ada pula hidup tersesat padahal ketika hendak hidup tanpa bertanya kepada siapa pun tanpa bekal apa apa ia menjelma tepat dengan hidung di atas mulut kuping di kedua sisi kepala di atas kaki di bawah dan sebagainya melalui jalan yang benar
3724271 bagaimanakah orang mati dapat menjelma menjadi babi hutan andaikatapun benar maka orang justru dapat merasakan bagaimana hidup sebagai babi hutan pasti hanya berdengus dengus mencari ubi dan pastilah tidak takut dihentikan dari pekerjaan melainkan takut di semak semak hutan sedangkan yang dialami berpuluh puluh tahun hidup sebagai manusia pun tidak enak misalnya ketika mencari pinjaman tidak berhasil atau ditagih hutangnya tidak sanggup membayarnya enakkah hidup sebagai orang
3724272 kesialan ini tentu lantaran aku tidak membakar kemenyan dan tidak bersembahyang pada malam menjelang hari jumat yang lalu sehingga daganganku tidak laku
3724273 anak itu pasti dijegal oleh syaitan penunggu jalan perempatan itu oleh karena itu kejang kejang badannya
3724274 peristiwa itu adalah pernyataan kanjeng ratu kidul ratu laut selatan yang marah lantaran gagal dalam mencari korban untuk pesta perkawinan putra putrinya sehingga diletuskannya gunung merapi beledar beledur beledar beledur
3724275 jika setiap malam merendam diri sambil mengucapkan mantera mantera ini daiam waktu empat puluh hari pasti aku akan memperoleh karunia dan senangiah aku selama lamanya
3724276 orang sudah dipesan sedemikian rupa orang sedang prihatin bertapa supaya memperoleh kurnia mengapa kamu pun masih mau saja dan kini semua usahaku batal dan untuk mulai lagi aku tidak sanggup
3724277 rasa malu kali ini benar benar melukai hatiku aku tidak kuat menanggungnya itu lain dengan pengalaman pengalaman yang lampau
3724278 malu yang mana yang kau tidak kuat menanggungnya kenyataan yang tengah dialami ini benar menimbulkan rasa malu benar benar menyebabkan kau meringis sehingga kau benar benar tidak berani keluar rumah menemui orang namun meskipun demikian kau tetap kuat menanggungnya juga
3724279 sakitku kali ini benar benar berat benar benar aku tidak kuat menanggungnya lain dengan sakit yang lampau
3724280 sakit yang manakah yang kau tidak kuat menderitanya kenyataan yang sedang dialami ini benar benar sakit berat sehingga kau benar benar merintih namun meskipun demikian tetap kuat menanggungnya padahal betapapun hebatnya orang menderita sakit ia hanya berakhir dengan mati sedangkan kalau cuma mati saja ia mesti kuat menjalaninya dan itu telah dialami oleh beribu ribu orang yang mati kalau aku mati pasti perjalananku sama dengan orang osang yang telah mati itu
3724281 keinginan itu jika tercapai tidak menimbulkan bahagia melainkan senang sebentar yang kemudian akan susah lagi dan bila tidak tercapai pun tidak menyebabkan celaka hanyalah susah sebentar yang kemudian akan senang lagi
3724282 silakan keinginan berusahalah mati matian mencari senang senang abadi dan berdayalah mati matian menolak susah abadi pastilah tidak berhasil kamu keinginan tidak mengkhawatirkan lagi
3724283 aku ini tergesa gesa menuju ke kakus pastilah ingin buang air
3724284 aku ini pasti mendapat malu karena meringis ringis dan tidak berani keluar rumah
3724285 akulah berkeinginan yang senang yang susah yang malu yang kepedasan yang ingin buang air adalah aku
3724286 if he resigns ahead of the impeachment motion being moved in parliament the ppp led ruling coalition will give him safe passage
3724287 owe no man any thing but to love one another
3724288 just as the rich rule over the poor so the borrower is servant to the lender
3724289 the wicked borrow and do not repay but the righteous give generously
3724290 the artistic directors made that decision after consultation with the broadcasters
3724291 the artistic directors just picked the best voice and the best performer
3724292 elevation of the state total authoritarianism and mass performance without a single individual person it was stunning on the visual level barren on the human level
3724293 this sense that the world was coming to pay obeisance of course it was all harmonious only chinese civilization was visible and nothing about world civilization
3724294 this kind of opening ceremony is possible only in china because nobody else has that many people
3724295 to achieve these kinds of effects is possible only in china which has a state system that can attain perfection at all costs
3724296 the dancers had no individual faces because they only mean something in the context of the group it was like an army moving in formation

3724454 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3724455 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3724456 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3724457 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3724458 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3724459 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3724460 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3724461 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3724462 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3724463 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3724464 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3724465 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3724466 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3724467 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3724468 im on my way home and i hear a boom boom boom its not a common thing but were used to being careful

3724471 we had been reluctant to talk about this before now but definitely in view now for phelps mark spitzs record of seven olympic golds
3724472 im almost at a loss for words the people that came before us that competed in the olympic games are some of the greatest athletes that ever lived to win the most gold medals is unbelievable i have no idea what to say

3724492 the point i made and ill make it again is that al qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will thats their fundamental underlying strategy that if they can kill enough americans or cause enough havoc create enough chaos in iraq then well quit and go home and my statement was that if we adopt the pelosi policy that then we will validate the strategy of al qaeda i said it and i meant it
3724493 a political party cannot be all things to all people it must represent certain fundamental beliefs which must not be compromised to political expediency or simply to swell its numbers
3724494 oh no first of all if i took one vote away from a serious candidate it would be a sin
3724495 at the same time that the american taxpayer was being asked to bail these companies out barney frank the chairman of the financial services committee instituted a sort of tax on freddie and fannie and that tax goes into whats called an affordable housing trust fund

3724497 youre just petty politicians whod sooner sign onto the wisdom of a tyrant in another country than the demands of ticked off voters in your own
3724498 the point i made and ill make it again is that al qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will thats their fundamental underlying strategy that if they can kill enough americans or cause enough havoc create enough chaos in iraq then well quit and go home and my statement was that if we adopt the pelosi policy that then we will validate the strategy of al qaeda i said it and i meant it
3724499 a political party cannot be all things to all people it must represent certain fundamental beliefs which must not be compromised to political expediency or simply to swell its numbers
3724500 oh no first of all if i took one vote away from a serious candidate it would be a sin

3724532 it was very gradual hindi siya biglaang lumabas it didnt manifest right away we dont want to use the word curable but the doctors say its treatable
3724533 alam mo sa totoo lang ayoko talagang mag expect hindi ako yung taong eto ang gusto kong gawin tapos hindi nangyari madi disappoint hindi naman ako yung klase ng tao na pag merong bagay na hindi nangyari sa akin e madi depress na ako kung may mangyari why not
3724534 ito muna talaga yung tema namin just like the first one that we did puro mga cover songs lang din ang ginamit namin secondly eto rin yung madali nang gawin e kapag existing na yung mga songs youll just have to sing it your own way your own version at saka yun na nga convenient sa akin lahat ng mga ito somehow familiar songs so it would be easier for me to record it
3724535 nagsimula kami actually nung late last year then we finished when i got back here lahat ng recording dun ginawa tapos meron lang little curing na ginawa namin dito
3724536 since it did good why not do another one ano rin naman e wala rin naman akong bagong album so might as well do it you know tsaka hindi naman talaga ako laging nandirito hindi ako permanente rito it would be nice if theres something they her fans can listen to while im not around
3724537 it will come soon hopefully next year you know when im not that busy
3724538 hopefully babalik kami ng october with another casino we just cant tell kung ano yon
3724539 naka break kami nung natapos kami sa flamingo nag tour na lang muna kami ng society of 7 umikot ikot muna kami hanggang sa mahilo kami
3724540 umikot ikot kami sa u s nagpunta kami ng atlantic canada marami kaming shows sa west coast so pagkatapos nun eto na nandito na ako para magpatuloy yung utak ko na nagtatrabaho
3724541 if not okay lang yun lang its not something na talagang pinagpupursigihan ko good reviews doesnt really sometimes it really takes a lot of luck just like what happened to charice and arnel pineda of the journey you know theyre like youtube wonders you know sometimes maispatan ka lang ng ganung tema youre on your way hindi pa nangyayari sa akin e
3724542 alam mo sa totoo lang ayoko talagang mag expect hindi ako yung taong eto ang gusto kong gawin tapos hindi nangyari madi disappoint hindi naman ako yung klase ng tao na pag merong bagay na hindi nangyari sa akin e madi depress na ako kung may mangyari why not
3724543 kung hindi man mangyari meron pang ibang magagandang bagay na dapat kong tuunan may iba pang mga bagay na puwede ko pang gawin
3724544 sa ngayon tinutuunan ko talaga tong album na to hanggat nandirito ako pero ganun pa man e kasi dun las vegas ako nakatira e dun kami nabubuhay ngayon e hindi ko maaaring iwan kung ano yung ginagawa ko dun
3724545 isa pa lang yung anak namin ng husband ko noon pa man nag usap na kaming mag asawa kasi actually ako yung laging nagsasabi kay noli her husband noon na ako yung nagpu push ng idea na nakikita mo ba yung sarili natin na magpatuloy ang buhay natin sa ibang lugar
3724546 sabi ng husband ko bakit mo sinabi yang idea na yan wherein mahusay ang buhay natin dito sa pilipinas maayos naman tayong pamilya meron naman tayong bubong sa ibabaw ng ulo natin
3724547 hanggang sa malaki na yung dalawa naming anak it was actually middle of 2002 na nagbabalak na talaga kami kumbaga nag give in na siya sa idea ko na manirahan na sa ibang bansa and we were looking at canada as a place to migrate to
3724548 ako yung time na yon sabi ko okay na na experience ko na yung ganitong klaseng career nalaman ko na kung anong klase yung ganitong buhay na naging isang singer naging isang recording artist naging isang concert performer sabi ko i guess this is enough
3724549 kasi lumabas lang naman ako sa music industry dito sa philippines ng 1997 really really late
3724550 and then nag ano na nga kami ng mga papers ready na talaga kami we were already ready hanggang sa we had this phone call na late 2003 there was an invitation for us to go the u s and see a show sa las vegas there was an offer sa aming mag asawa for a business sa u s magmula noon parang unti unti nang nag iiba yung course nung tina travel naming mag asawa hanggang finally we found ourselves in america instead of canada
3724551 ano pa lang kami doon magpa five years pa lang kami e di ba doon kailangan mong mag ano ng five years bago ka mag apply ng citizenship e wala pa naman kami limang taon magli limang taon pa lang although resident kami doon
3724552 so hindi ko talaga masabi na babalik ba ako dito in a matter of two years or three years hindi ko masabi but kung babalik ako dito malamang yun yung time na mga retiring age na kaming mag asawa ang sama ano
3724553 you know what bakit ka naman hindi mag iisap ng retirement kung may sapat ka nang pera para masuportahan mo yung ano kasi alam mo sa amerika lahat dun kailangan mong i prepare yung sarili mo for your retirement e
3724554 so youll never know malay mo pumalpak yung economy ng amerika wala rin naman akong pupuntahan kundi dito but then again sa ngayon okay ang buhay namin dun
3724555 dapat to nangyari na to nung 2003 i think siguro we were busy actually siya yung talagang matinding busy ako rin naman although what makes me busy naman kasi hindi lang naman career ang inaasikaso ko i still have my personal life to attend to
3724556 this is really something im very excited ano to ito yung im pretty sure hindi naman sa nagbubuhat ako ng bangko pero ito yung something na alam kong inaabangan ng mga tao
3724557 isa yun sa magandang part na somehow pasasabikin namin yung mga tao dun sa u s muna mauna bago dito sa pilipinas

3724590 mccain is ready to be commander in chief on day one tested in war and peace he has passed both tests with honor that shows not only his ability but his character
3724591 georgia s territorial integrity must be respected all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia and the united states the united nations security council and the international community should fully support a peaceful resolution to this crisis
3724592 we urge restraint on all sides that violence would be curtailed and that direct dialogue could ensue in order to help resolve their differences
3724593 and i believe that its important that we act in a bipartisan fashion now theres no room for partisanship now
3724594 there is a huge bottom line difference on what the nature of the u s relationship should be with russia
3724595 senator mccain has talked about that literally for years i think the first major speech he gave expressing concerns about russian policies in former warsaw pact or former soviet countries was in 1993 i don t know when was the first statement senator obama might have given about russia
3724596 second if you look at senator obama s statements about russia they principally talked about the need to engage in a cooperative relationship to address proliferation threats and securing loose nuclear materials he has talked relatively little about the issues i just spoke about now he has made a couple statements of support for a nato membership action plan for georgia and ukraine but again you cant compare a 15 year historical record with three or four statements over the course of 15 months
3724597 we can not act on the basis of ideology or preconceived notions
3724598 when this crisis began barack obama the administration indeed and all of our nato allies took a very measured and reasoned appraoch because we were dealing with the facts as we knew them john mccain shot from the hip very aggressive very belligerent statement and he may or may not have complicated the situation

3724615 were unhappy with what happens when you come home and thats a much larger problem
3724616 it has to do with the uneven nature of medicare in canada and how some provinces seem to excel at it and other provinces dont provide the same quality of it
3724617 but its fundamentally unfair to push the wounded soldiers and already over stressed families onto an already overburdened civilian health care system
3724618 there has to be some sort of inclusion for the long term care costs of rehabilitation and psychological care for the soldiers when theyre in uniform and when they come out of uniform
3724619 the federal government should ensure there are regional centers at a minimum that would provide for the care and the rehabilitiation

3724628 when i used the term making tea i was not talking about any gender specific activity but it was a figurative thing meaning doing brian mulroneys bidding we know she was appointed to the senate by brian mulroney and is widely regarded as being his proxy in cabinet and those are the matters that i was referring to
3724629 stephane dion must show that these comments are not acceptable in the political process and immediately reprimand his caucus members
3724630 if liberal mps are allowed to publicly use offensive language like thibaults without consequence it shows that stephane dions commitment to women in politics rings hollow
3724631 many of them are worried about the kind of tone thats set where women are stereotyped

3724674 once again well be shooting for some season tickets to donate to the local charities we were able to raise enough funds to get 6 tickets last year 2 adults 4 children wed of course like to meet or beat that amount so anyone who wants to donate a few quid is more than welcome i want to stress that this is a drive that is collecting any sum you wish to donate this isnt a season ticket or nothing kind of initiative if someone wants to donate a fiver that is fine a few donations like that and we have enough for a childs ticket for example last year we had donations of anywhere between 10 pound to 360 pound with this wide range of donation amounts we were able to get the 6 tickets mentioned before wendy our charity liaison from last season has signed up once again to help us out which is massive but there might be a time where we need to call on some other intrepid blackburn resident fan to help with the pick up distribution of the tickets but well cross that bridge when we come to it the procedure for donating will be the same as before donating via paypal to dtbranam yahoo com is still the preferred option but if anyone doesnt want to fiddle with paypal they can contact me directly and we can work something else out again i will be publishing the amount donated amongst the donors in order to keep everything as transparent as possible so if you want your donation to be anonymous please let me know if you need any assistance setting up a paypal account let me know as well if anyone is not clear about what exactly this charity drive does or is intended to do or any details from last years drive you can always contact me and ill answer any questions messaging me through the message board is fine as well as e mailing me at dtbranam yahoo com is fine as well

3724694 this was a last minute question a choice we had to make
3724695 our rehearsals had already been vetted several times they were all very strict when we had the dress rehearsals there were spectators from various divisions including above all a member of the politburo who gave us his verdict we had to make the swap

3724697 i dove in and they goggles just filled right up with water it got worse and worse through the race and the last 75 meters going into the 150 wall and the finish i couldnt see the wall i was just hoping i was winning and hoping i could get my hand on the wall first thats sort of why i ripped my goggles off real quick because i was kind of upset that it happened but i saw that i did a best time and was happy
3724698 when i was on the stand for the award ceremony for the 200 fly i started thinking about it and thats when i started tearing up to be at the top with so many great athletes whove walked in these olympic games its a pretty amazing feeling

3724703 it was good but its over with and i have to move on to the next race i wasnt thinking about that at all

3724706 it kind of inspired me to work a lot harder so i can get as much attention for the team as she got for her team
3724707 personally i like the schedule because it strengthens our team
3724708 even if we dont win those games those games prepare us for the playoffs because strong teams help you out in the playoffs
3724709 these guys always get my back especially my linemen they dont get a bunch of credit but they do an amazing job
3724710 we like the formation it tends to balance out defenses and forces them to eliminate some of the things they do not everything obviously but we like the formation
3724711 whether or not we can play it as much as we have in the past is just going to depend on stuff as it happens
3724712 my role is to catch whatever is thrown at me if they want me to go deep ill catch it and if they want me to stay short ill catch it i like the role of being the guy that they want in on goal line situations

3724722 lenders have been lambasted from all sides the financial services authority has accused them of treating customers unfairly and not helping people through their difficulties and the citizens advice bureau accused them of aggressive behaviour and using court action as a first rather than last resort
3724723 if lenders had provided more affordable mortgage ppi policies that match my prices i suspect more people would be able to keep their homes although not all those struggling to make repayments have lost an income due to redundancy it is a key factor homeowners who lose their wage could wait up to nine months for any government help in meeting their mortgage payments as support has been delayed from six months if they had ppi they would receive back to day one payments and have their mortgage repayments met for up to a year
3724724 i worry far more families than this will be affected which is why lenders must act now and stop offering cover that is at least four times more expensive than mine
3724725 this cover wont solve everyones financial problems but it will at least help those who do face the threat of redundancy lenders have a duty of care to make this insurance affordable and easily accessible

3725011 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
3725012 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
3725013 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
3725014 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
3725015 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
3725016 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
3725017 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
3725018 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
3725019 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
3725020 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
3725021 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
3725022 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
3725023 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
3725024 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
3725025 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
3725026 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
3725027 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
3725028 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
3725029 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
3725030 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
3725031 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
3725032 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
3725033 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
3725034 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
3725035 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
3725036 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
3725037 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
3725038 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
3725039 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
3725040 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
3725041 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
3725042 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country
3725043 no its too long as it is just leave the length thing alone
3725044 oh yeah youll have people tripping over it and suing us
3725045 having gotten drilled by a scorching line drive off the bat of brad ausmus

3725048 any information transmitted by wire radio optical cable electromagnetic or other similar means
3725049 the growth in the use of technology and social networking sites by younger americans has fueled a fear among professionals that cyber bullying will become the means most often utilized to harass
3725050 while certainly more prevalent in the elementary and secondary school setting issues related to bullying or intimidation are increasingly relevant in other nontraditional settings
3725051 i should be there by now did i make the wrong turn
3725052 we all possess some intuitive sense we know our convictions from our mere hunches
3725053 this sense of confidence or lack thereof is critical to our success but how it arises in the brain has long been a mystery
3725054 these neurons seem to have been registering after the rat made its decision how uncertain the animal was that it was about to receive its desired reward
3725055 we tested several alternative explanations but the best explanation for the neural activity we observed was that these neurons were signaling the confidence of the animal about its decisions
3725056 although previous work had suggested that confidence estimates might be a complex process restricted to humans and perhaps other primates
3725057 our results to the contrary show that for the brain to estimate confidence in a choice is no more complex than calculating the choice itself
3725058 we are what we think all that we are arises with our thought with our thoughts we make our world
3725059 the subsidiaries here failed to take appropriate steps to control the potentially high risk combination in the structured credit groups holdings of exotic products opaque valuations and high leverage

3725102 leigh jones is a pleasure to work with a delight to listen to and a joy to behold
3725103 i had a concept for an idea unique to the marketplace
3725104 i told my staff to find me a beautiful young girl who had soul at the very core of her being they brought me over a 100 girls to audition but when leigh sat next to me before she even opened her mouth i knew she was the girl and when i got her in the studio she was even better than i could have imagined
3725105 ive always known that i wanted to be a singer
3725106 i loved r amp b from the very beginning my family had a lot of jazz around the house and my father worked closely with the great clare fischer so we had lots of great musicians coming through our home id accompany my dad to sessions soaking up the vibe and even got to sing on a power rangers clip
3725107 leigh jones vocal instrument is fantastic her style is fluid sexy and refreshing unlike many of the generic songstresses of today this young woman is a star
3725108 leigh jones has that it factor shes cool shes gorgeous and shes real leigh is incredibly talented a singers singer a good songwriter and a producers dream i am privileged and proud that we are partners
3725109 leigh jones is an extremely talented and rare young singer who is uniquely gifted musically she blends all of the elements of pop r amp b jazz and blues and brings them all masterfully into the now throughout my career i have never seen or heard of anyone like leigh jones shes authentic and she can do it all
3725110 throughout my career i have been blessed to discover many great musical talents i feel leigh jones is destined to be one of the next great stars she can do it all pop r amp b jazz and blues shes awesome
3725111 now that were vibing right i feel its o k for me to open up myself for everyone to see tell my story in three part harmony every chord reflecting the heart of me so many things are going on i find the answers in my song so sing until the daybreak comes so yall can understand where im coming from
3725112 you cant place these songs with anybody else we made every effort for me to not come across as a cookie cutter singer trying to sound like whoever is all over the radio at the moment im recording music thats very me and totally different when we came to andi howard at peak without any solicitation from kerry or i she picked every song that we preferred she truly understood the best part of my artistry that ive been shooting for my jazzier r amp b oriented stuff
3725113 my first producer had me cut three songs in more of an alternative rock vein
3725114 but it just didnt feel right when he shopped them but nothing happened i was actually relieved but this was also the time when britney spears and christina aguilera were just coming out so every other producer i met wanted to turn me into one of them showing my mid drift and dancing i knew i had to work on myself to show who i really am that involved me doing more of my own writing finding the strongest part of my vocal register as well as figuring out what i was going to wear its hard for people to look beyond those kinds of things
3725115 when i met with kerry i had no idea i was going for some kind of audition
3725116 i actually thought that might be too jazzy for me when i first heard it
3725117 kerry listened to my complaint then told me to do it anyway as i got into it i found that the lyrics were so dead on i dont think women say this as often as they should look im not gonna sit here and cry you can creep on me if you want to but ill be doing it too im not as meek as you think i am i thought it was refreshing to sing a song like this with that attitude
3725118 having gone through so much here myself i grew up in l a so i really understood it i dont think there has been a song thats pinpointed and told that story so well
3725119 at first he was directing kerry from the outside but every time we thought wed gotten it right he kept saying youve almost got it finally kerry just said please come to the studio for just a couple of hours because something was being lost in the translation it turns out there was this one note he needed me to nail kerry had asked me about it before and i told him i couldnt do it but when mr berry gordy asked me to do it i got in that vocal booth and he scared it out of me on the first take actually it was just his presence that scared me because for all the warnings i got from people he really was the sweetest man ive ever met
3725120 throughout my career i have been blessed to discover many great musical talents i feel leigh jones is destined to be on of the next big stars shes awesome
3725121 leigh jones has that it factor shes cool shes gorgeous and shes real leigh is incredibly talented a singers singer a good songwriter and a producers dream i am privileged and proud that we are partners
3725122 its so flattering to have all these people behind me but its also a little embarrassing these are men who have worked with the very best not to take anything away from me but sometimes it surprises me it makes me want to work even harder
3725123 going through the hard times really kept me in check
3725124 made me hungry now all i want to do is gig every night for two shows a night im willing to give this all ive got because its all ive wanted to do
3725125 the two most important things i look for in an artist is that they be unique and that they have genuine god given talent leigh can deal with r amp b pop jazz and blues and quite frankly you would not expect that from a white female artist very few have been able to pull that off except maybe bonnie raitt and even she could take it just so far i really feel leigh jones shes got my undivided attention and the best is yet to come
3725126 we call upon the nation to observe three days of mourning and hold peaceful demonstrations
3725127 i was talking out of context i dont know their church never been to their church
3725128 i looked in her eyes and realized she was looking at the cockpit i positioned myself in front of the cockpit
3725129 i still was trying to understand what was going on because it happened so quick my main concern was i wasnt going to let this lady in the cockpit
3725130 can you look into my eyes and tell me where i am going to go
3725131 how is it you were totally incapacitated for those five days
3725132 can you explain how passengers or the captain were not aware of that
3725133 so the roller coaster ride in bostons always fun luckily we got the cheers at the end
3725134 after that first inning when they had us down 10 0 i think everybody in the ballpark and everybody in all of massachusetts thought that the game was over
3725135 nobody should ever score 10 runs in the first inning its embarrassing
3725136 but we know our team is capable of fighting back
3725137 this was a game that i think potentially could have been a major downer for us
3725138 and we actually turned around and made it actually a great win
3725139 if they didnt quit tonight i dont think theyre ever going to quit
3725140 we had a lot of work to do obviously to get in a position where apple and at amp t would feel good about best buy mobile carrying it and thats what weve done in the last 18 months

3725148 we have been hearing from russia we dont want to stay
3725149 the idea is to show the russians that it is no longer business as usual
3725150 one of my goals was to have an up sounding bunch of music
3725151 i wanted the music to be sophisticated yet accessible i also wanted the lyrics to be personally meaningful to make sure i was getting out what was in my heart
3725152 but then it got to be an exciting time soon after because i learned that choosing a particular door opens up all these other doorways thats what the song is about
3725153 all these people were calling me up to play bass
3725154 but i decided to work on songwriting and hire myself as bass player
3725155 i was like now im going to take the ball and run with it lyrically i wanted this excited feeling of flying through the air to come through
3725156 she leapt like a frog but got caught by the green sparrow
3725157 i lived in a tucked away rural neighborhood that was like a fairyland
3725158 for years id been wanting to do stream of consciousness improvising and use the resulting jams to write songs and music
3725159 interesting patterns come out when youre not thinking about it
3725160 if im willing to make unplanned left and right turns as a runner then ill be more likely to take adventurous left and right turns while im playing music too
3725161 if inside in was a headphones album then the green sparrow is one that id like people to crank at a party
3725162 then i let go of the idea of playing with other people because i wanted to work alone for a year then i came up with all these great songs but let go of some of them for the sake of the album
3725163 some people might see me as introspective but this time i wanted to put out something fun the green sparrow has cheerfulness and a certain amount of smile to it if thats what people get from the album then ill be happy

3725193 economic growth is expected to ease back in the coming quarters and years
3725194 the economy has been slowing since the middle of 2007 08 and growth will continue to ease as the recent rounds of policy tightening and the impact of recent currency appreciation continues to feed through
3725195 domestic demand will continue to drive growth in the short term supported by strengthening exports as this sector continues to gain competitiveness although short term gains may be more moderate owing to the weaker global economy

3725527 even if cios face no current shortage of mainframe resources realize that the laws of supply and demand cut both ways increased competition for talented mainframe resources is likely to become a catalyst for staff attrition in the coming years

3725570 by using more complete climate data in this case 19 variables measuring climatic extremes averages and seasonal variation we can make more accurate predictions of species distributions
3725571 combining this climatic data with localities for the burmese python allows us to create powerful models for predicting suitable habitat for the snakes
3725572 when modeling species distributions it is important to consider a large amount of climatic data and evaluate the methods used especially when dealing with important issues such as invasive species whose ecological limitations may not be immediately obvious
3725573 but wait we offer a strong segmentation tool were rolling out this or that weve always had this and he just doesnt get it
3725574 start giving me test design tools so i can measure the change on my site
3725575 note your visits per uu is going up but pvs per uu per month is declining which means users are coming back more but visiting fewer pages in general this change happened around may 3 2008 did something change on the site

3725583 phbs in india are less optimistic about their revenue prospects in 2008 84 per cent compared to 2007 92 per cent however their levels of optimism regarding revenue performance are well above the global average of 63 per cent
3725584 economic growth is expected to ease back in the coming quarters and years
3725585 the economy has been slowing since the middle of 2007 08 and growth will continue to ease as the recent rounds of policy tightening and the impact of recent currency appreciation continues to feed through
3725586 domestic demand will continue to drive growth in the short term supported by strengthening exports as this sector continues to gain competitiveness although short term gains may be more moderate owing to the weaker global economy
3725587 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race

3725593 agitations of this nature discourage investors and therefore peace and tranquillity must prevail in the state to ensure that its industrial prospects are not derailed
3725594 who are you how many hit records do you have

3725598 how many lives were lost during your tragic vote or die campaign in 2004 when will your savage thirst for blood be slaked
3725599 what have i ever done what have you ever done aside from you know launching a multimillion dollar media empire lording over a hugely successful clothing line shaping the career of perhaps the greatest mc of all time scoring a series of hits as both a producer and a solo artist and running in the new york city marathon on a whim actually wait never mind
3725600 your skin is way smoother than i wouldve imagined given the amount of times i have seen your proactiv commercial
3725601 in tons how many magick talismans ancient tomes aleister crowley artifacts did it take to convince jimmy page to appear in the video for that god awful song you did on the godzilla soundtrack
3725602 did you know that the average american is blessed with a blissfully short memory and yet a seemingly endless appetite for nostalgia so much so that he or she is willing to forgive most transgressions and forego all pretenses of taste in exchange for a song that will sound excellent in very large speakers or at the beach are you aware that most of us are doddering sods brainless infants who prefer things big and loud and shiny and equate aesthetic excess with true happiness do you realize theres a sucker born every minute did i just let the cat out of the bag
3725603 thank you for not beating me with a champagne bottle or a telephone receiver
3725604 he is a dreamboat if i were that age and single id be in so much trouble
3725605 i said youd be exactly my type he liked it he was like that would be great i was of course teasing but of course not teasing
3725606 hes so nice and grounded and sweet as can be hes the real deal hes a teen idol
3725607 she was great shes a very normal 15 year old girl and i guess that makes her extraordinary considering the circumstances
3725608 she works hard and shes got a good attitude i think with the right direction and the right choices she can do some great things
3725609 hes a very nice guy and we had a real good time together
3725610 shes such a different character than jan shes earthy with no ulterior motives
3725611 you know shell either be a great mother or be the greatest example of what not to be as a mother
3725612 itll be interesting to see michael and jan now they always have a power struggle he had it all last season and now shes got it back again and it keeps them an interesting couple
3725613 for some more time inflation can increase it could touch 13 percent but by december it will start declining and is likely to moderate to 8 9 percent by march 2009
3725614 there is a slowdown in agriculture industry and services and the global environment is not very conducive to growth this will affect indian economy as well
3725615 but im already starting to get the ideas and the aesthetics and everything and its very different from 2006s the black parade
3725616 its hard to say at this point but musically how black parade tapped into the glam classic rock of queen and ziggy stardust this taps into something different not punk but maybe in its proto sense the aesthetic it is extremely different and it is more stripped down too when we get a chance were going to get together and do some demos and start rolling but were going to take it slow i feel like we needed to be away for a while people need to kind of miss us because there was a point in the last two and a half years where you could have seen us at least once a month if you wanted
3725617 its weird sometimes you give interviews and they catch you in a weird mood on the road and youre like nah i didnt say it was going to be a more punk rock record i just thought it would be more stripped of the bells and whistles
3725618 i started remembering my dad did this movie called putney swope i was in new york at that time and the character was supposed to be a vietnam soldier so i was remembering some of the folks who were hanging out in the west village back then
3725619 without it being too specific i just started this gravelly cool very world weary voice and i said oh my god im going to have a ball with this
3725620 i laid the voice on stiller and he laughed and i thought you know hes just laughing to make me feel ok and then hes going to change it all when we get there
3725621 he was really improvising a lot of the time and there was a little bit of a question like is that intelligible
3725622 we did some looping too but it really was who the character was and what he was playing the idea of this australian guy playing this black guy and his interpretation of that that was always what we were satirizing the idea of to try to be taken seriously
3725623 i think this is going to be a big coming out party for him as a comedian
3725624 you knew he was a great actor with chaplin but all of the films hes made were great dramatic films this is the first one where its been full blown comedy and his skills are sharp
3725625 life is too goddamn serious things are scary i got to laugh my ass off in this movie ill take that over rocket science any day and ill certainly take that over self important dramatist
3725626 at the heart of public diplomacy in our view and essential to the success of the rest of it is the critical task of building conducting and sustaining the long term relationships through which the world most fundamentally knows americans and forms its core assumptions about what america is

3725628 hes just a loser who sweeps up in a recording studio
3725629 you wont give anybody any credit unless its yourself kevins a studio producer and a musical whiz kid
3725630 well just because you met the guy at a bus stop doesnt mean that youre a musical genius too
3725631 yeah but ive got contacts besides kev said ive got a great voice
3725632 yeah but kev says that to all the girls besides what this band needs is somebody to call the right shots and make the right decisions
3725633 because i know more about the music business than you do
3725634 hey whiz kid got time yet to give three gals a helping hand
3725635 he just presses some buttons on his recording desk and pulls some levers hes a genius at that sort of thing he even made the diamond girls sound half decent
3725636 sure girls heres a number one hit single that i just wrote yesterday especially for you
3725637 besides not everyones got star quality like the chix after school on tuesday evening the girls took the train up to london gladys came too because although she wasnt in the band somebody had to look after her as she was still too young to be on her own at home in fact gladys knew that she could look after herself better than the sisters but that was how things were when they got to london they took the underground train to the station called goodge street which laura said was in the swanky part of town in fact when they got out it looked pretty grotty to gladys kevens studio was on the fifth floor of a tall office building it was about the size of the their bathroom at home gladys watched how he kissed all three of her older sisters on both cheeks he didnt seem to notice her at all well what have you got girls
3725638 we were kind of hoping that youd help us out with that bit see as youre such a whiz kid
3725639 right girls go behind the sound proof glass and put some headphones on ill play you some loops and well see if we can build up a sound just for you
3725640 the chix are kind of a bit funkier than that
3725641 the chix are kind of a mix of different musical styles and influences if you see what i mean
3725642 yikes are you sure your mate knows what hes doing
3725643 ah hum kevin the girls were just shy about saying theyve got some music i brought it here on this disk

3725653 but i wouldnt want a framed picture of one on my desk
3725654 many women find the idea of looking at it in great detail to be yucky
3725655 they may not view that part of the body to be visually arousing like for example the buttocks
3725656 i dont like looking at them either i mean who wants to look at two balls and a stick
3725657 it makes me think i never want to have sex with a man again i like the feel of penises not the looks of em
3725658 looking at that penis makes me want to be a lesbian
3725659 its like looking at ice cream its something you want to eat but its not necessarily beautiful
3725660 men looked at the female face much more than women looked at mens and both looked at the genitals comparably
3725661 if you give them hope that they have a hope in their education then that should take care of any discipline issues

3725941 russian occupying forces are continuing movements across georgia despite the ceasefire
3725942 upon the withdrawal of georgian troops to their barracks russian troops will return to the territory of the russian federation
3725943 fifty russian tanks and apcs are in gori they russian soldiers are not entering buildings
3725944 neither russian peacekeepers nor any units subordinate to them are present in gori
3725945 there were no other movements of russian forces overnight and no additional bombing
3725946 there is a text it has been accepted in moscow it was accepted here in georgia i have the agreement of all the protagonists
3725947 it immediately became clear that in fact the confrontation was hardly finished
3725948 it is too early to reach unequivocal conclusions about whether the agreement reached by medvedev and sarkozy will really put an end to military actions in south ossetia
3725949 saakashvili is characterised by his unpredictability and a lack of willingness to respect agreements
3725950 those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3725951 we dont worry about coming back to be no 1 but we want to be driven by outstanding cars and trucks the latest technology and participating in the world market overall

3725956 if you had one last lecture to give before you died what would it be
3725957 if you were more discerning you d probably buy this book if you do read this book you will be this book on discernment is simple clear well written and well illustrated
3725958 we have been invited by the palestinian red crescent society of gaza to go to gaza the people of gaza expect us and will come out in their boats to meet us we will fish together
3725959 we are going through international waters we are not going through israel israel claims gaza is unoccupied and so we are going to unoccupied territory we will embark in cyprus and disembark in gaza this can play out in many ways we may get blown out of the water we may get towed away but we will remain nonviolent and exercise the sovereignty of international waters for we are not going through israel we will not allow the coast guard to enter onto our boats we will demonstrate nonviolently our solidarity with the residents of gaza who invited us we are taking food water medicine but the issue is solidarity with the people of gaza if our rights are denied we will remain nonviolent
3725960 israel is not a democracy but is an ethnocracy meaning a country run and controlled by a national group with some democratic elements but set up with jews in control and structured to keep them in control missing from israels security framing is the very fact of occupation which israel both denies exists and that security requires israel control over the entire country rendering impossible a just peace based on human rights international law reconciliation
3725961 dont worry we know you are coming and we are waiting
3725962 you see in the andean cosmovision the past is in front of us and the future is behind us
3725963 everyone that is but an old man they all went to him hear why he disagreed and he told them that in one direction was a well ojo de agua and if they made a road over it there would be no water for future generations
3725964 so the indigenous way is not majority rule because that isnt democracy democracy is consensus
3725965 for the past thirty years in ecuador weve seen the consolidation of political parties linked to powerful economic interests
3725966 each powerful economic group has had two modes of expression a political party and the media and so the social movements have had alternatives because the political parties and the media were completely controlled by those powerful economic interests the only means of expression for social movements was the power of revocation by means of demonstrations demonstrations aimed at the overthrow of presidents
3725967 pro abortion pro homosexual and has taken the name of god in vain so as to get more votes
3725968 conflicts between correa and the social movement left the indigenous movement environmentalists and unions among others have become increasingly heated
3725969 ecuador is a territory of peace the establishment of foreign military bases nor foreign installations with military objectives will not be allowed

3725975 if we can show that we can burn helium 3 it is a much cleaner and safer energy source than other nuclear fuels
3725976 i dont think that the main motivation to go back to the moon is helium 3
3725977 but over the long term we do face an energy problem
3725978 this reduces radiation issues and also greatly simplifies the engineering
3725979 helium 3 is present on the moon but in very small concentration levels meaning that many hundreds of millions of tons of soil must be processed to extract a ton of helium 3
3725980 our real challenge is not obtaining the helium 3 it is demonstrating that we can burn it
3725981 in colombia its easier to organize a guerrilla movement than a trade union anyone who doubts that should try to organize one at their workplace
3725982 the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america in essence the americans have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals
3725983 a new model of cooperation in the energy sector that would allow foreign partners to share in the economic benefits of the project share the management and take on a share of the industrial commercial and financial risks
3725984 much of the city tskhinvali was reportedly in flames friday the regional parliament building had burned down the university was on fire and the towns main hospital had been rendered inoperative by the bombardment

3725991 the center for medicine in the public interest the public policy home of drugwonks
3725992 suggesting that sidney have his eyes examined would only be a partial diagnosis
3725993 has once again failed in this responsibility these drugs need much stronger warnings especially a black box warning such as the one we have proposed
3725994 heres usa today crawling through the mud past janet woodcock who officially speaks for the fda to talk to david graham about avandia
3725995 perhaps most importantly they want the next president to appoint a tough fda commissioner completely independent from the industry
3725996 messrs dingell and grassley and their allies have ordered about 20 investigations of drugs and issues involving the fda
3725997 mr grassley began his campaign to overhaul the fda in 2004 during an uproar about the agencys slow reaction to potential links between popular antidepressants and teen suicides
3725998 now he has four staffers and a parade of fda whistleblowers helping him investigate a plethora of fda controversies such as its approval of the antibiotic ketek
3725999 some current and former fda safety reviewers have opened a whistleblower website to air their concerns that fda leaders are pushing them to approve some drugs
3726000 a website launched and operated by current and former us food and drug administration staff who believe public health is being put at unnecessary risk these concerned civil servants and ex civil servants have either experienced or are aware of wrongful directives by us fda upper management directives that put public health at avoidable risk
3726001 interesting omnibus piece from by warren ross of medical marketing amp media on the various slings and arrows being tossed at the worlds premier medical regulatory agency
3726002 weep and whine and try to get decisions made that are based on politics rather than on science
3726003 the motive may be either to get drugs approved or not approved it cuts both ways
3726004 good thing she didnt include this stirring stupak statement from an la times article about why andy von eschenbach sandy kweder janet woodcock and the fdas cafeteria guy should resign
3726005 heparin hypocrisy hyped up safety fears on adhd drugs does medicaid kill poor people
3726006 yet another show trial held by another congressional committee on the fda there have been four or five over the last two months on heparin alone
3726007 if we dont make some rapid progress on fixing the foreign drug inspection program the next melamine or heparin tragedy will soon be upon us
3726008 coming from a guy who helped push up the suicide rates by scaring parents away from antidepressants and who is pushing for drug importation at a time when al qaeda and hezbollah are involved in drug counterfeiting
3726009 andy must have to shower after sitting through such a show trial
3726010 meanwhile the steve nissen fear factory spews out another piece of tabloid medicine ekg monitoring of all kids getting stimulants for adhd
3726011 now theres a way to achieve nissen who has never studied adhd goal of making a physicians hand quiver before writing a scrip for the drug
3726012 if people dont agree with his policy positions they should dispute them firmly strongly logically and respectfully
3726013 that they have chosen character assassination only shows the weakness of their intellectual arguments as well as their disappointing lack of character
3726014 new and better way to establish drug safety that solves a one of the more serious problems in drug development namely that animal studies are often a poor and inaccurate substitute for what happens in human
3726015 sid wolfe has opposed every effort to speed drugs to dying patients since he has been on his anti patient jihad starting in 1970
3726016 since his organization makes money by hawking a book worst pills best pills that argues the most drugs are dangerous
3726017 is partially responsible for the decline in ssri prescription use and the corresponding increase in adolescent suicide
3726018 and this guy is head of the health subcommittee why is he being taken seriously why isnt he being held accountable
3726019 there should be a black box warning around everything stupak says regarding medicines
3726020 particularly ssris which have been shown to benefit patients and are associated with a decline in suicides
3726021 when i served as associate commissioner at the fda dr healy visited with me but he never mentioned that he worked for the tort bar
3726022 because in my experience republicans such as senator grassley and staffers working for them such as emilia desanto have appeared more concerned about and more effective on the issue than anyone else and as a republican appointee i thought peter pitts heart might be in the right place
3726023 what was not well known at the time was that peter pitts was transiting between working for pharmaceutical companies or perhaps not even transiting
3726024 im not sure how many of us would have felt it worth going if we had known his background
3726025 it seems astonishing to me now that with people like peter pitts in fda that it was ever possible to bring the suicidality issues to light
3726026 and again there is no link to ssris and in increase in suicides rather some unclear evidence based on an unvalidated measure called suicidality that includes just talking about self harm in general
3726027 whose flawed study about ssris and suicide triggered a series of events which lead to less ssri use and more suicide
3726028 the increase amounted to roughly 10 percent and that occurred in a year in which new and controversial black box warnings were added to the labeling on the medications
3726029 for his persistence zeal and determination to damage not only the fda but the public health for his effectiveness in fear mongering and willingness to subordinate medical progress to his ascetic view of safety
3726030 but he seems to spend a lot of time in the halls of congress advising members and staff about which fda medical reviewers should be hauled in for polite conversations
3726031 setting aside dr grahams contribution to the vioxx populi literature which an fda advisory committee considered to be a rather shoddy piece of research he also helped push through the statistical analysis and organize the public outcry over ssris that resulted in a decline in antidepressant use and a corresponding increase in teen suicides
3726032 his assertion that avandia should be taken off the market
3726033 is best remembered in 2007 as the conduit for steve nissens half baked meta analysis of avandia
3726034 helped blow out of all appropriate proportion fear about drug safety in general and avandia in particular
3726035 persistent undermining of the fda came close to winning him clipboard top honors for 2007
3726036 the food and drug administration was also negligent in the vioxx case those running the nations public safety agency repeatedly dismissed the concerns of their own scientists and seemed to do everything possible to keep the public in the dark about emerging problems with vioxx
3726037 i wonder how much more money the senator will get from the trial lawyer lizards as a reward for such vituperative rants

3726040 la eventual disminuci n al final se va a transformar en llevar las tarifas al precio que estaban hace algunas semanas atr s y la disminuci n no va ser tal entonces yo creo que todo esto se ha manejado muy medi ticamente y que el ministro se pasee por regiones ech ndonos la culpa a nosotros era lo nico que faltaba
3726041 el tema de fondo es que aqu no podemos beneficiar s lo a algunos chilo tambi n es parte de chile y este proyecto no considera ning n apoyo para nuestra zona no es posible adem s que sigamos pagando el kil metro m s caro en el pa s
3726042 la verdad que la bancada tiene una decisi n de votarlo a favor creo que claramente a la derecha no piensa en las regiones no han hecho una propuesta para regiones y dicen que esto es un chantaje que no pueden chantajearlos por el financiamiento a regiones pero sin embargo no hacen ni una propuesta ni siquiera para el transantiago y menos lo he visto en el caso de las regiones
3726043 no es efectivo que nosotros hayamos obstaculizado el problema de regiones que son dos temas totalmente distintos ya que en santiago el problema es por el transantiago y en regiones es por el alza de los combustibles nosotros hemos intentando por todos los medios de buscar una soluci n y vemos que el gobierno ha politizado el tema y el ministro ren cortazar es parte del problema no de las soluciones
3726044 evidentemente es incierta y si tuvi ramos los votos estar amos cantando victoria y creo que estar an muy contentos todos los chilenos porque quienes ocupan el transporte p blico es la gente de m s bajos recursos y la clase media
3726045 dado que hay un beneficio social para 15 millones de chilenos que importante es anteponer ese objetivo social a las consideraciones pol ticas que cada bloque pol tico leg timamente pueda tener

3726051 on the other hand we should make the us public to be aware of right information on the occasion and american journalists are over here with this goal the azerbaijani journalism has not such large history of its development as the american one has journalists should work closer with one another to inform the population in an accessible form
3726052 after arrival in baku i came to conclusion that american journalists should be sent here to familiarize themselves with the situation closer

3726060 my whole reason why im so mad about it is because democrats need to act like democrats
3726061 democrats work for a living and they have to work and take care of their families and they say these are open to those in the community so they shouldnt ask people to drop everything in their lives for this

3726108 het is een kwestie van network tipping microsoft is de gevestigde orde en beheerst ruim negentig procent van de wereldwijde werkplekken afgezien van de kwaliteit van het product dat ibm levert zijn het de kosten voor het overstappen die de doorslag geven denk hierbij aan training beheer downtime etcetera
3726109 contextuele invloeden spelen hierbij een rol de introductie van de asus eee laptops bijvoorbeeld een deel van deze nieuwe lichting minilaptops draait linux met openoffice daar bovenop wanneer meerdere initiatieven tegelijk de echte consumentenmarkt bereiken dus niet alleen de hardcore linux adepten bestaat de kans dat de markt daadwerkelijk verschuift
3726110 apple wint ook aan marktaandeel voor zijn mac computers door de populariteit van de ipod en iphone een eerste kennismaking met de mobiele devices zorgt hierbij ook voor een toenemende populariteit van the real thing wellicht lift ibm ook mee in de slipstream van de eee laptops en soortgelijke producten
3726111 mijn overtuiging is wel dat het een goede zet is in een onomkeerbare richting die de komende jaren zijn beslag zal krijgen
3726112 wat ik mis in dit artikel is de nadruk op open een van de grote voordelen is dat de broncode van deze systemen is door iedereen die dat wil aan te passen
3726113 dat is mijns inziens geen sterk argument het haalt de kwaliteitsbeleving van de genoemde omgevingen naar beneden en trekt het verkeerde afnemerspubliek in een zakelijke omgeving
3726114 dat wordt ook tijd zelf werk ik al enkele jaren met een microsoft loze pc en eerlijk gezegd mis ik microsoft niet het is een verademing dat je niet continu antivirus en nodig hebt
3726115 het verhaal is dat van kip en ei als er een kleine installed base is wordt software niet geport en als software niet wordt overgezet blijft de installed base klein het is helaas ook niet mogelijk betrouwbaar aan te geven hoeveel systemen linux draaien omdat het gratis is er zijn dus geen verkoopresultaten
3726116 meer concurrentie in werkplekoplossingen is altijd goed het biedt ruimte voor een meer zakelijke omgang met dienstverleners al was het maar omdat die in een opensource context minder gemangeld worden tussen eindgebruiker en pakketleverancier
3726117 in de praktijk valt op dat de acceptatie van linux als besturingssysteem op servers veel groter is dan publiekelijk bekend lijkt te zijn ook bij bedrijfskritische systemen linux werkplekken zie ik nog niet vaak voorbijkomen bij transacties die door ons begeleid worden en hier lijken interoperabiliteitsproblemen mede debet aan te zijn de markt lijkt er intussen wel rijp voor
3726118 de dominante positie van microsoft op de desktop markt is enorm ik ken geen winkels die een pc niet standaard leveren met windows behalve de apple stores natuurlijk
3726119 de meeste eindgebruikers hebben geen weet van andere mogelijkheden en vinden dat een pc gewoon moet werken zonder moeilijk gedoe gelukkig voldoet linux de laatste jaren steeds meer aan dat laatste punt het werkt gewoon zonder dat je allerlei moeilijke dingen moet doen en moet weten

3726140 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3726141 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3726142 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3726143 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3726144 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3726145 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3726146 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3726147 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3726148 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3726149 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3726150 we believe some animals were left behind that were not fed and some of the puppies got to him not intentionally attacked him but used him as a food source
3726151 mommy when i grow up i wanna be a passenger
3726152 you know the man who stands up in front of the church and talks about god
3726153 so do you have any one time at god camp stories
3726154 how am i supposed to tell him to stop when i got caught doing the same thing
3726155 oh man why didnt i think of that of course the side stairs are better for sneaking out
3726156 a lawyer at the european university institute in florence has reported swedens new surveillance law to the european commission
3726157 phantom flashbulbs false recollections of hearing the news about challenger
3726158 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3726159 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3726160 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3726161 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3726162 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3726163 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3726164 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3726165 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3726166 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3726167 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3726168 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3726169 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3726170 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3726171 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3726172 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3726173 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3726174 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3726175 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3726176 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3726177 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3726178 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3726179 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3726180 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3726181 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3726182 on a positive note nvidia announced a 1 billion increase to its stock buyback program
3726183 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3726184 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3726185 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3726186 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3726187 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3726188 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3726189 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3726190 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3726191 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3726192 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3726193 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3726194 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3726195 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3726196 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3726197 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3726198 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3726199 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3726200 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3726201 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3726202 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3726203 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3726204 and its an amazing country where an arizona multimillionaire can attack a chicago south sider as an elitist and hope to make it stick the chicagoan was brought up by a single mom who had big ambitions for him and he got scholarshipped into harvard law and was made president of the law review all of it on his own hook whereas the arizonan is the son of an admiral and was ushered into annapolis though an indifferent student much like the current occupant both of them men who are very lucky that their fathers were born before they were the chicagoan who grew up without a father wrote a book on his own using a computer the arizonan hired people to write his for him but because the chicagoan can say what he thinks and make sense and the arizonan cannot do that for more than 30 seconds at a time the old guy is hoping to portray the skinny guy as arrogant good luck with that sir
3726205 the hand still hurts but the wrist has good mobility and the fingers are no longer swollen the foot is still taped just to avoid rough movements i started training last week mostly on my bicycle i hope i can have a good race at brno to start the second part of the championship in the best possible way brno is a good circuit with some interesting uphill and downhill sections very much in the style of the classic circuits the atmosphere is always great with a big and enthusiastic crowd on race day getting the set up right for this track is always a delicate operation aiming to get the best compromise between cornering ability and braking stability
3726206 my doctor and other specialists say that if i rode this week i might have to fight the injury for the rest of the year as hard a decision as it is and as bad as i feel about it i think im better off staying home doing rehab and physio then come back fit at misano and try to finish the season strong theres been a lot of guys this year trying to ride less than a hundred per cent and actually making their problems worse i certainly feel bad about it for my team and i apologise i had the permission of hrc to do the supermoto thing i just wanted to do some riding during the break have some fun and i thought that maybe itd give me a little spark for the rest of the season but it backfired on me
3726207 this year on the brno circuit we will have another unknown factor as the tarmac on the circuit has been re laid so we will have to see how it affects the degradation of our tyres it is a technical circuit with a wide variety of curves and turns the circuit is challenging to go fast on but its enjoyable over the past two years with the 250cc machine ive got two second places but with the motogp bike it is difficult to make a prediction i enjoy the track but it is not one of my favourites
3726208 my crew and myself have been given a great challenge this weekend taking a completely new bike to the track at the start of the season you have all the time you need to set a bike up and adapt it to your riding style whereas now well have to do it against the clock from the first free practice well have to work flat out and hope the weather is on our side because well need all four sessions to fully understand the bike in any case the chance to ride it at brno makes me optimistic on paper the new bike is more powerful than the one weve been using so far which is an important factor at this track
3726209 brno is a track i like a lot because its so varied with some fast and winding sections i stayed at home over the break training hard to get over the various problems i picked up in the race at laguna seca paying particular attention to the fractured left thumb and sore back i dont think theyll cause me any problems at brno and ill be 100 fit im not worried about the new surface because im sure bridgestone will have worked hard to find the right solution for the tyres
3726210 brno is one of my favourites and in 2003 i won the 250 race after the race in laguna i feel very confident for the rest of the season i think we found the right set up to develop the bike on each racetrack the good place we gained in the us gave us more incentives to be more competitive in the last weeks i enojoyed my vacation but i also trained a lot to be physically fit for the heat at brno and at misano after the race we will also have two days of testing
3726211 at the brno circuit we have done well in testing but weve not got the race results weve wanted this year i want a good race to earn points to put me back up in the championship standings i enjoy the track its technical with many turns both uphill and downhill overtaking isnt a problem as its a wide circuit we may find that the new track surface may affect the level of grip but we are determined to put in a good performance
3726212 i know brno is a technical and challenging track but this weekend i want to bounce back after a disappointing german gp where i didnt have a good race having a few weeks rest back home was great i spent some time with my relatives did some media commitments in my country and attended class at my university now im back to full fitness and eager to ride my honda rsw again for the second part of the season ill do my best
3726213 geoff was the top privateer and non superbike finisher in both races
3726214 it is older than some of the tracks we compete on and it is somewhat different it is almost like running on three different sections and there are lots of elevation changes in the back you have to link the corners to make it all work my game plan is pretty much the same as always and that is to qualify well and get out in front as soon as possible our hondas are really spot on so we should only have to make minimal changes and we will be good to go
3726215 there are only three races left in each series and being able to win them all would be awesome
3726216 i was fast in practice all weekend and i felt i rode well if you know you rode your best it really helps give you that extra shot in the arm and bolsters your confidence i took the win in both classes at vir in 2007 and we should be able to do it again it is a very physical track and the weather can be extremely hot and sticky the weather in my hometown is definitely hot and humid and i train outside every day i either ride my bicycle or go motocrossing i like being outside and daily training makes me feel ready to race my best
3726217 but hopefully the last race was a start of things turning around and luck will be in my side for the rest of the year
3726218 this is a good example of symantecs policy of taking robust action against people who deal in counterfeit software
3726219 while the amount of damages is certainly significant more importantly our goal was to put a stop to this operations dealings in counterfeit symantec software and to protect any unsuspecting users from using fraudulent security software

3726223 if a developer is not careful he may find that its simply not worth his time building and supporting his product if consumers continue to expect low low prices without limit
3726224 no secret there are just 2 simple steps first you recruit people around the world in proportion to your business if 10 of your business is in nigeria 10 of your managers should be nigerian you mix them up if they never leave their homes they never become international managers send them on visits expatriate assignment put them in international teams and projects so they mix with their colleagues and learn
3726225 if you do these 2 things in no more than 50 years you will have an international management group

3726234 i think the fear is that somehow large corporations will censor their content their points of view right
3726235 i think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy which by the way would have a big first amendment problem
3726236 then whoever is in charge of government is going to determine what is fair under a so called fairness doctrine which wont be called that itll be called something else
3726237 so will web sites will bloggers have to give equal time or equal space on their web site to opposing views rather than letting the marketplace of ideas determine that

3726242 by seizing the opportunity to pound georgia with air strikes and military incursions vladimir putin russias prime minister is sending an emphatic message with global consequences the curtain has fallen on the era when nato steadily expanded into eastern europe and onwards to embrace the former republics of the soviet union and russia was able to respond with nothing more than bluster the balance of power in europe has fundamentally changed

3726261 following a course that is horrifyingly similar to that taken by stalin and hitler in the 1930s
3726262 the undermining of the sovereignty of a small democratic neighbouring state through the use of violence
3726263 georgia is to an extent the finland of today both morally and strategically
3726264 reincorporate old soviet areas into the kremlins sphere of control
3726265 if georgia no longer has its sovereignty it means not only that the west is cut off from the caspian sea and central asia but we can also assume that putin will exercise a similar strategy against ukraine if he faces resistance hes already publicly voiced threats against ukraine
3726266 dominated by anglo american oil interests ultimately purports to exclude russia from oil and gas deposits in the caspian area as well as isolating moscow politically
3726267 related to the drive to extend and protect the investments of transnational corporations in the caspian sea region especially the oil corporations
3726268 the united states did not merely encourage georgias young democracy it helped militarize the weak georgian state at senior levels the united states helped rewrite the georgian military doctrine and train its commanders and staff officers georgia meanwhile began re equipping its forces with israeli and u s firearms reconnaissance drones communications and battlefield management equipment new convoys of vehicles and stockpiles of ammunition the public goal was to nudge georgia toward nato military standards
3726269 you can go outside and spit and have the same effect as doubling carbon dioxide
3726270 if were to have even a medium sized solar minimum we could be looking at a lot more bad effects than global warming would have had
3726271 the global warming alarm is dressed up as science but it is not science it is propaganda i was horrified to read the ipcc 2nd and 3rd assessment reports because there was so much misinformation
3726272 mosquito species that transmit malaria do not usually survive where the mean winter temperature drops below 16 18 degrees c
3726273 in fact mosquitoes are extremely abundant in the arctic the most devastating epidemic of malaria was in the soviet union in the 1920s there were something like 13 million cases a year and something like 600 000 deaths a tremendous catastrophe that reached up to the arctic circle arkhangel a city 300 miles further north than helsinki finland had 30 000 cases and about 10 000 deaths so its not a tropical disease yet these people in the global warming fraternity invent the idea that malaria will move northward
3726274 they are not going extinct or even appear to be affected
3726275 how could it be determined that so many thermometers were wrong by an average of 0 5 degrees in one particular year several decades ago and an accurate retrofit be made why is the adjustment 0 5 degrees one year and 0 1 degrees the next
3726276 i am baffled by the mann claim that incorrect mathematics doesnt matter because the answer is correct anyway
3726277 not because they were wrong indeed these measurements were made by top scientists including two nobel prize winners using techniques that are standard textbook procedures the only reason for rejection was that these measurements did not fit the hypothesis of anthropogenic global warming i regard this as perhaps the greatest scientific scandal of our time
3726278 the global atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has increased from a pre industrial value of about 280 ppm to 379 ppm in 2005 the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide in 2005 exceeds by far the natural range over the last 650 000 years 180 to 300 ppm as determined from ice cores
3726279 plagued with improper manipulation of data an arbitrary rejection of high readings from old ice and an arbitrary rejection of low readings from young ice simply because they did not fit the preconceived idea of man made global warming
3726280 what frustrates me is the feeling that everything has already been said and published that all rational argument has been used yet it does not help
3726281 trend toward abandoning scientific objectivity in favor of political agendas
3726282 reason environmental extremism emerged was because world communism failed the berlin wall came down and a lot of peaceniks and political activists moved into the environmental movement bringing their neo marxism with them and learned to use green language in a very clever way to cloak agendas that actually have more to do with anticapitalism and antiglobalism than they do anything with ecology or science
3726283 i think if we dont overthrow capitalism we dont have a chance of saving the world ecologically
3726284 the deceit behind the attempts to discredit evidence of climate change reveals matters of importance this deceit has a clear purpose to confuse the public about the status of knowledge of global climate change thus delaying effective action to mitigate climate change the danger is that delay will cause tipping points to be passed such that large climate impacts become inevitable the ones who will live in infamy if we pass the tipping points are the captains of industry ceos in fossil fuel companies such as exxon mobil automobile manufacturers utilities all of the leaders who have placed short term profit above the fate of the planet and the well being of our children

3726322 i thought it was not really me driving a miura by myself past the company gate i remember the feeling i was approaching curves too fast but i wasnt at all i was so respectful yet afraid of the cars performance but the engines sound was making me smile the whole time
3726323 they say you never forget your first love and that miura was truly my first love it was personal to me because the car symbolized and embodied ferruccio lamborghinis philosophy it was an honor to drive it and still it is the miura is an icon in sports car history
3726324 despite driving so many years and kilometers everyday is still exciting and fresh with great emotion my longtime experience makes the driving more easy and pleasant and the feeling is always a friendly sensation
3726325 i have great satisfaction that lamborghini is being honored at the pebble beach concours delegance
3726326 pebble beach is the biggest and most famous car show in the world every enthusiast knows about it its a very exclusive event and its important for us to be here to see my company being honored by pebble beach and to be a judge is very satisfying
3726327 it will be difficult to judge them because they are all authentic and beautiful but i am happy they asked me to do it the list of lamborghinis is very impressive and i know every screw every part and detail of the cars so im looking forward to judging them
3726328 wouah un rapport comme a tu as du le pondre en 3 heures
3726329 of special relevance to the courts present inquiry congress included in the fisa bill a declaration that the fisa regime together with the omnibus crime control and safe streets act of 1968 were to be the exclusive means by which domestic electronic surveillance for national security purposes could be conducted
3726330 the court is charged with determining whether fisa preempts or displaces not a common law set of rules for conducting foreign intelligence surveillance but rather a privilege asserted by the government to avoid public and judicial scrutiny of its activities related to national security
3726331 this imperfect overlap between the preempting statute and the common law rule being preempted does not however create serious problems with finding the state secrets privilege preempted or displaced by fisa in the context of matters within fisas purview
3726332 the legislative history moreover buttresses the courts reading of the statutory text as intending that fisa replace judge made federal common law rules
3726333 defendants advance essentially three points in support of their contention that nothing in fisa indicates any intention by congress to abrogate the state secrets privilege in the case of intelligence driven electronic surveillance
3726334 this hardly counts as authority that the presidents duties under article ii create a shield against disclosure
3726335 fisa makes little provision for notice to surveilled individuals except when the government chooses to disclose surveillance materials and the provisions that exist are easy for the government to avoid
3726336 a host of obstacles make section 1810 a mostly theoretical but rarely if ever a practical vehicle for seeking a civil remedy for unlawful surveillance
3726337 dormant indeed the print version of the united states code annotated contains no case notes under section 1810 the parties have cited no other case in which a plaintiff has actually brought suit under section 1810 let alone secured a civil judgment under it
3726338 this is not to say that it is impossible to obtain relief under section 1810 but the fact that no one has ever done so reinforces the courts reading of the plain terms of the statute section 1810 is not user friendly and the impediments to using it may yet prove insurmountable
3726339 the lack of precedents under section 1810 complicates the task of charting a path forward nonetheless the court believes that dismissal with prejudice is not appropriate accordingly plaintiffs fisa claim will be dismissed with leave to amend
3726340 what all run by gigantic corporations is that really the answer i think not that would be the absolute destruction of everything and the classic way of ensuring that there is no food in the future
3726341 with nature we have gone working against nature for too long
3726342 its an entirely luddite attitude to simply reject them gm crops out of hand
3726343 prince charles should stick to his royal role rather than spout ing off about something which he has clearly got wrong
3726344 prince charles has hit the nail on the head about the damaging false solution that gm crops present
3726345 gm crops will not solve the food crisis and forging ahead with an industrialised farming system will continue to fail people and the environment around the world

3726354 the federal appellate court in washington has already validated alabamas position that atlantas future water supply plans violated federal law alabama believes that atlantas current withdrawals also violate federal law and we are pleased that the federal court has placed that issue on a fast track for resolution
3726355 we feel like it will turn out in our favor how do you go back now and say water supply is not an authorized purpose
3726356 its almost ludicrous to even imagine a ruling coming down like that

3726378 our growth both externally as well as internally was massive the sheer number of new servers and their associated applications proved especially challenging as we attempted to reconcile our business expansion within the physical limits of our current infrastructure we knew virtualization was a means through which we could effectively and intelligently approach our integration challenges

3726399 we are not contemplating his departure robi will continue with us
3726400 well didnt they know they wouldnt be able to afford that balloon payment
3726401 um no i dont here is the payment the date you took it and the person who signed for it
3726402 i dont have any late fees because ive paid on time
3726403 i am surprised if i was in their position i would be playing
3726404 its hard to criticise them at this point though because if they come out the next two weeks and make the side then it was a great decision not to play here
3726405 but if they dont make the side they will be kicking themselves
3726406 i think nicks going to pick ian if he has to because of his second place at the open and if paul casey is playing decently you would definitely pick him
3726407 id be surprised if nick went for monty though from what ive heard wild cards go to players in form and paul mcginley told me that the last thing you want is to go to a ryder cup playing badly
3726408 he was an informant during the time that he was dealing with us
3726409 admitted intentions to harm 250 or more victims and traffic the stolen information
3726410 his argument would basically be that gonzales threatened him as a government agent in order to induce him to plant the sniffer
3726411 he would not have planted the sniffer but for the threat and his sentence was based on that
3726412 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3726413 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3726414 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3726415 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3726416 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3726417 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3726418 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3726419 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3726420 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3726421 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3726422 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3726423 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3726424 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3726425 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3726426 we continue to evaluate our liquidity and our alternatives to improve the balance sheet
3726427 well continue to look at that to make sure that we have adequate liquidity to successfully implement this very significant kind of transformation
3726428 that is our intent but also i dont want to walk away from the fact that theres lots of variables hitting this business every day
3726429 our role is to make sure that were as flexible as we can be to kind of take those things coming at us both the good and the bad
3726430 what we really need to do is tell people that were back in the car business

3726438 the focus on warner could help boost his prospects in virginia where he is trying to win an open senate seat and obama is also campaigning hard
3726439 in an attempt to address the moral convictions of evangelical christians and roman catholics the democratic party has proposed a platform that speaks a new language on abortion rights featuring a focus on reducing the number of abortions
3726440 im not driven by sen obamas schedule but its a very tough thing to do
3726441 what barack obama needs at this point a running mate who can play not just on the stage of a swing state but who on the global stage where the next administration will be required to perform immediately

3726502 how much better are modern tools compared to the ones of say 10 years ago
3726503 to play a guy who lives in a fairly macho world among other men a very male world with the presence of the father hes a brat a bit of a hooligan but you needed to still feel attracted to him because you have to stay with him for 90 minutes so it was harder for me to get inside tom at the start of the film but when the piano arrives its nice to play him because the character has a kind of madness he has something extra he can escape inside his head its like a drug he has music the piano that was very enjoyable but it wasnt so easy to find the tom of the beginning

3726506 below the sanctuary in the fellowship hall a banner for slavery reparations proclaimed they owe us fliers recounted herbert daughtrys arrest a few weeks earlier as he led marchers protesting the not guilty verdict in the police killing of sean bell an unarmed black man his ministry has always combined consuming spirituality with black liberation theology the theology jeremiah wright invoked this spring to defend his controversial sermons and zealous political activism leah holds these forces within her
3726507 while the media hounded wright for his anti american rants and while presidential hopeful sen barack hussein obama divorced him as his personal pastor obamas head will be crowned by leah daughtry who ardently believes in the same marxist black liberation theology preached by wright
3726508 he is just a normal person but maybe from a different planet
3726509 growing up i always wanted to be an olympian now to be the most decorated olympian of all time it just sounds weird saying it started setting in a little bit after the butterfly i was just trying to focus on my next race but i just kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool title im definitely honored
3726510 ive got three races left so there had better be something left in the tank
3726511 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3726512 there is nobody in our sport that can win like he wins

3726515 its the most fun thing to be in a team environment and be part of a relay its cool when you get four americans who all swim well together everyone has to play their part or its just not going to happen weve been lucky that weve been able to do that
3726516 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3726517 any medal in an event that is not on your regular program is great
3726518 i went out there and i raced tough and thats all i can do
3726519 it was definitely a tough day but i think i handled it pretty well
3726520 this finding may yield new insights into a form of altered brain activity occurring in schizophrenia
3726521 it may also lead to new methods for screening drugs with potential as schizophrenia treatments
3726522 its analogous to tuning in the weak signal of a distant station on your car radio as opposed to picking up the strong signal of a station thats nearby
3726523 for the first time we were able to show that neuregulin 1 which has been genetically implicated in schizophrenia affects a brain activity that appears to be altered in schizophrenia
3726524 future studies of brain regions rich in erb4 receptors may yield important information on the nature of schizophrenia

3726528 we have no news on when investigations into other issues will finish but the court will continue no matter what

3726540 i plan on attacking this sport head on this season
3726541 i will be training harder stronger and be faster than ever with my 16 year experience in adrenaline rush
3726542 training for a successful upcoming season requires discipline and consistency
3726543 theres a lot of good competition and this sport is world inclusive so if i expect to win i have to have a superior training formula
3726544 high oil prices are transforming the worlds political landscape and launching an era of high tech innovation that could rival the internet boom
3726545 moving at speeds of up to 110 kilometers per hour these racers are pretty exciting to watch
3726546 its great to have these teams back here at mt hutt it brings a real excitement to the mountain we are privileged to play a part in their continued success both at world cup and also their planning toward vancouver 2010
3726547 this is unlike any of our other ptfe tapes on the market

3726549 nebraska beef has a contentious history with the usda over the past six years federal meat inspectors have repeatedly written it up for sanitation violations and the company has fought back from september 2002 to february 2003 usda shut down the plant three times for problems such as feces on carcasses water dripping off pipes onto meat paint peeling onto equipment and plugged up meat wash sinks
3726550 a privately held firm which does not file annual reports with the u s federal securities and exchange commission nebraska beef was founded in 1995 by a group of investors led by company president william hughes in alliance with day lee inc the u s arm of nippon ham of japan
3726551 this is another example of a broken federal system that hasnt put enough resources into stopping the problem
3726552 in terms of the number of students who are ready this year compared to last we are talking about genuine progress
3726553 more students are reaching at least a minimum level of readiness for college credit courses were keeping a lot of kids from having to take remedial level courses that translates to millions of dollars that are being saved at the state level
3726554 we have a more heterogeneous population of test takers so were including those kids who werent considering college or arent considering college

3726564 like the gtx 280 which has dropped in price over the last few weeks the gtx 260 has followed suit whether youre a fan of ati or not the release of the hd 4800 series and their performance to price ratio has forced nvidia to cut margins on the new gtx line up of cards and give us an extremely powerful card for what now resembles a fair price to date weve only had a look at one gtx 260 which came with a massive out of the box overclock what this means is it hasnt really given us the ability to completely come to terms with what the gtx 260 offers in its cheapest form the stock form

3726569 the people hired in an improper way did not themselves do anything wrong it therefore would be unfair and quite possibly illegal given their civil service protections to fire or reassign them without individual cause
3726570 where there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime we vigorously prosecute
3726571 but not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
3726572 it would have ill served the public interest not to appoint him merely because those who first hired him had violated the civil service laws
3726573 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
3726574 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how to renew americas promise
3726575 mark warner is the future of the democratic party and putting him on tuesday night with hillary clinton is exactly right move for obama
3726576 we call upon the nation to observe three days of mourning and hold peaceful demonstrations
3726577 people are fleeing there is a mood of absolute panic the idea there is a ceasefire is ridiculous
3726578 they asked villagers to hang white flags or handkerchiefs outside their houses if they did not want to be shot they say
3726579 behind them say eyewitnesses is a whole column of irregulars who locals say are chechens cossacks and ossetians
3726580 eyewitnesses say they are looting killing and burning these irregulars have killed three people and set fire to villages they have been taking away young boys and girls
3726581 for three hours there were people fleeing in cars i saw one with 11 people and a lada with eight people in it
3726582 were reported to have been seen in the village of tedotsminda near gori
3726583 plain and simple blatant aggression on the part of russia
3726584 they shot their brother russian peacekeepers then they finished them off with bayonets so we are not going to see them there any more
3726585 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
3726586 abkhazia and ossetia if i mention territorial integrity are to the best of my knowledge part of georgia
3726587 nato is not seeking a direct role or a military role in this conflict

3726634 for the first time we may have a highly useful model of postpartum depression
3726635 the new research also points to a specific potential new target in the brain for medications to treat this disorder that affects 15 percent of women after they give birth
3726636 after giving birth female mice deficient in the suspect protein showed depression like behaviors and neglected their newborn pups
3726637 giving a drug that restored the proteins function improved maternal behavior and reduced pup mortality
3726638 improper functioning of the delta subunit could impair the gaba systems ability to adapt to hormone fluctuations during the highly vulnerable post partum period
3726639 targeting this subunit might be a promising strategy in developing new treatments for postpartum depression
3726640 these findings reinforce the fact that women should not drink alcohol during pregnancy
3726641 prenatal exposure to alcohol especially excessive amounts at one time can adversely affect the fetus and may increase the risk of infant clefts
3726642 the greater the blood alcohol concentration the longer the fetus is exposed a single binge during a critical period of an infants development can be harmful
3726643 fortunately heavy maternal drinking is uncommon in many populations but the fact that it is happening at all tells us we need to do a better job of letting mothers know about the effects that alcohol can have on their babys development
3726644 understanding the structure and design of the hiv spike has been the subject of intensive effort for over a decade because of its potential importance in understanding mechanisms of viral entry into immune system cells and designing treatment and prevention approaches
3726645 the sophisticated imaging techniques used in this hiv aids study have the potential to advance our understanding of not only hiv but many other diseases including cancer
3726646 previous research showing how hiv interacts with immune system cells and antibodies has been important in vaccine design
3726647 however understanding the complete structure of the viral spike may reveal other vulnerable targets this knowledge will be crucial to solving the puzzles associated with strategies at the heart of virus invasion
3726648 the insights gained by understanding the binding of one of the most effective broadly neutralizing antibodies lays the foundation for designing more effective strategies for blocking hiv infection
3726649 we are working actively to increase the resolution of our structural analyses and to understand the differences in binding between antibodies that neutralize which are very rare in hiv infected individuals and non neutralizing antibodies that are found in almost all aids patients knowing what these differences are will be critical to designing better strategies to neutralize hiv and to providing a new addition to the arsenal of strategies to combat hiv aids
3726650 this research provides a better characterization of the variables at the cellular circuit and behavioral level that contribute to the persistent nature of addictive disorders
3726651 the researchers were able to illuminate why drug related memories are so stable
3726652 their persistence is highly refractory to new learning which makes our jobs that much tougher and reminds us that treatment must recognize and address the high propensity for relapse almost anywhere down the road
3726653 these results indicate that the ltp induced by self administered cocaine is more persistent than that produced by natural rewards such as food and that the ltp is not just a result of exposure to cocaine but also is linked to the drugs effects and the animals learning to obtain the drug
3726654 these are important distinctions that will help us better understand how addiction develops and why drugs can overshadow other natural rewards and become the mainstay of an addicted persons life
3726655 this is an important contribution to efforts aimed at identifying the molecular bases of alcohol tolerance
3726656 this represents a novel mechanism by which neurons are able to adapt to alcohol
3726657 moreover since adaptation or tolerance to the drug likely contributes to alcohol abuse our findings identify a potential molecular target for therapeutic intervention it is important to acknowledge a major contribution by my colleagues especially dr andre pietrzykowski in this work
3726658 this study demonstrates for the first time that alcohol exposure can cause rapid changes in microrna levels altering gene expression and perhaps behavior
3726659 in future studies it will be interesting to determine if similar microrna based regulatory mechanisms influence alcohol problems in human populations
3726660 although many of us have these changes in our genetic material they are about 15 percent more frequent in people with schizophrenia
3726661 we also discovered two large areas of chromosomal deletions that confer a great deal of risk for schizophrenia and confirm involvement of a third previously reported area
3726662 by implicating two previously unknown sites this study triples the number of genomic areas definitely linked to schizophrenia
3726663 it also confirms in a large sample that unraveling the secrets of rare structural genetic variation may hold promise for improved diagnosis treatment and prevention of such neuro developmental disorders
3726664 this tells us that variations in both of these areas are very potent risk factors for schizophrenia
3726665 brain metastases are rarely treated with drugs because many drugs do not cross the blood brain barrier a special wall of blood vessels in the brain that prevents the passage of most foreign substances from the bloodstream into the brain and spinal cord
3726666 for example trastuzumab herceptin is an fda approved antibody that targets her2 and it can inhibit breast cancers growth these antibodies are too large to pass the blood brain barrier to impact the cancer cells that have migrated to the brain however our mouse model suggests that lapatinib may successfully get across if successful in humans the drug may provide a new approach to treating brain metastases
3726667 lapatinib was tested in a human clinical study of brain metastases and showed only modest results
3726668 however we asked a different question rather than asking lapatinib to melt a golf ball sized metastasis in the brain we asked if it would be more effective at preventing micrometastases or small undetectable metastases from growing into large metastatic tumors
3726669 these findings indicate that lapatinib may be beneficial in the treatment of patients with her2 positive breast cancer who may have micrometastases and are thus at risk for the development of brain metastases
3726670 results of this study should confirm the use of laser treatment for diabetic macular edema and will have a significant impact on quality of life for tens of thousands of people being treated for diabetic macular edema in the united states each year
3726671 these findings substantiate the importance of laser treatment in the management of diabetic macular edema
3726672 our findings raise the possibility that combining laser with corticosteroids might produce greater benefit
3726673 millennium promise awards non communicable chronic diseases research training program
3726674 the burden of chronic diseases is rising across the world including in developing countries
3726675 as we continue efforts in fighting infectious diseases we also need to focus on these new challenges
3726676 the fogarty international center will encourage programs that prepare researchers and medical workers to address these new challenges provide training across disciplines and bridge gaps among the biological social and behavioral sciences

3726724 you saw the suffering of our forefathers in egypt you heard their cry at the red sea
3726725 you came down on mount sinai you spoke to them from heaven
3726726 but they our forefathers became arrogant and stiff necked and did not obey your commands
3726727 because of your great compassion you did not abandon them in the desert
3726728 you gave them kingdoms and nations allotting to them even the remotest frontiers
3726729 but they were disobedient and rebelled against you they put your law behind their backs
3726730 but as soon as they were at rest they again did what was evil in your sight

3726742 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3726743 the irc provides life saving humanitarian assistance to those most affected by the conflict and it is reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted
3726744 i would like to think these numbers are smaller than women think they are
3726745 remain terrified they are going to relapse i think the message for women is the risk may not be as large as they think
3726746 women who had er positive cancer were more likely to have late recurrences than those with er negative
3726747 estrogen receptor status is a tumor marker we look at
3726748 we know that those who have er positive tumors have cancers that are responsive to the effects of estrogen
3726749 the major message is that even though women may have gone through five years of hormonal therapy they are still at risk of relapse
3726750 basically the jury is out on the potential value of additional treatment strategies once the five years is completed
3726751 based on this study we need to be open to question whether other treatment programs may be appropriate in some of these women after the five year period is completed
3726752 they bundled me out of the park they forced me to the floor dragged me manhandled me into a restaurant next door

3726946 moreover the strength of the immune response was not dependent on infection by a weakened form of the virus and if we can harness the means by which these elite white blood cells stop the virus then we can hopefully teach or reprogram white blood cells in others to also target hiv
3726947 the presence of this genetic spot is a discordant result that strongly contradicts theories that various genetic factors alone play a protective role in suppression
3726948 elite suppression offers clues to vaccine researchers on many fronts how cd8 killer t cells can attack hiv and how a stronger immune response can force hiv into a permanent defensive state
3726949 this important agreement with at amp t reflects our strategy to converge network services voice services and wireless services

3726952 our results make it much more clear that all men and women concerned about their overall health should more closely monitor their blood levels of vitamin d and make sure they have enough
3726953 we think we have additional evidence to consider adding vitamin d deficiency as a distinct and separate risk factor for death from cardiovascular disease putting it alongside much better known and understood risk factors such as age gender family history smoking high blood cholesterol levels high blood pressure lack of exercise obesity and diabetes
3726954 now that we know vitamin d deficiency is a risk factor we can better assess how aggressively to treat people at risk of heart disease or those who are already ill and undergoing treatment
3726955 at this point it is well understood that continuous inflammation is also linked to chronic diseases such as diabetes rheumatoid arthritis and most cancers particularly those occurring in adults
3726956 in the past the prevailing scientific notion was that pathogen associated molecular patterns or pamps cause inflammation by activating the immune system when pathogens such as viruses parasites fungi and bacteria invade the body this type of immune response occurs in the setting of infection at this symposium scientists will present research linking the damps inflammatory response to chronic diseases including arthritis obesity atherosclerosis and cancer

3727002 the expertise and dedication of our missile defense agency customer and every member of the industry team have made this important mission success milestone possible
3727003 weve been using ip telephony since we launched the first phase of the hotel and residences in 2001
3727004 at the time the technology saved us the cost of running phone cables to 444 rooms and since we intended to offer high speed data services to our customers anyway offering voice calls over the same network was a logical choice it also meant being able to give our guests instant access to personalised voice and video on demand services from an integrated system and to manage the system remotely from a maintenance and billings perspective which is a distinct advantage of ip telephony over analogue services
3727005 in planning the second stage of the hotel as part of the greater bell city expansion we again looked at the market to see what competitive solutions were out there and discovered that switching to a nortel solution would save us 25 per cent or more than a 300 000 over the five years of a deployment contract
3727006 the upfront capital cost from other vendors was similar but nortels solution meant that we would save on annual maintenance fees and using nortels hospitality messaging system hms also be able to offer our customers an unprecedented level of service availability which translates into increased usage and revenue for the group and a better overall experience for our guests
3727007 combined with the simpler management of the nortel system the seamless integration of wireless ip telephony and data services and the easy scalability of the system to include new unified communications solutions in the hotel as well as other properties currently under development the switch to nortel made perfect sense in both business and technology benefits
3727008 despite the clear advantages of ip telephony and more recently unified communications technology in the hospitality industry the local industry has been slow to adopt the technology en masse
3727009 the main reason were given is perceived cost theres still a general perception in the industry that fully functional unified communications solutions are too costly to implement developments like bell city are slowly changing that mindset demonstrating how the competitive advantages of unified communications services like click to call video conferencing are not only good for guests but also for the business
3727010 working with avaya we have our communications requirements and implementation down to a science
3727011 we dont have time for complicated installations and we have zero tolerance for risk what we do need are powerful reliable communications that help manage costs and enable the nbc olympics team to do their jobs most efficiently avaya understands that completely

3727052 it is the only way we can play and we dont know any other way of playing
3727053 we have a group of players here that are proper footballers and that is what we will continue to do
3727054 we have not played in any game since i have come here where we have set up in what i think to be a negative defensive way
3727055 on saturday we went for it from the first minute and dominated territory in the first half away from home
3727056 a few people i spoke to at the celtic game on sunday were talking about clarky and they seemed to think he played better than i thought he played on saturday
3727057 we know him intimately and know how well he can play and there is more to come
3727058 but to get two goals as a striker in the first games is always a good way to start the season
3727059 it puts you in a frame of mind to go on for the season and accumulate a lot of goals
3727060 we need to win games but at the same time play good football
3727061 nine times out of ten the player wont hit it like that and it was a great finish for their third goal and you can only really applaud that

3727104 todays hackers are targeting unsuspecting pc users by silently infecting computers to send spam perform web attacks and carry out other crimes
3727105 infected computers often show no symptoms of infection making it difficult to know youve got a problem anti malware solutions need to be innovative and need to be catching new threats
3727106 the number of viruses and malware out there is growing at an alarming rate and the idea of tracking them by signature based solutions alone continues to be absurd

3727132 social media used to be web 2 0 and social networking but now we have moved on to a broader term that encompasses not only social networking but blogs podcasts user generated content social bookmarking microblogging and lifestreams the rise of all these forms of new media has also created demand for people who can help companies position and market themselves within this new realm
3727133 social media allows people to spread their message to hundreds if not thousands of friends followers and strangers some companies can only dream of that kind of reach while others pay millions in advertising for the same effect
3727134 parr says social media roles are capable of increasing reach users traffic and revenue examples none numbers zero the conclusion that mass media advertising is dead and the kids only trust teh tweets now doesnt come from market research it comes from social media consultants looking for new clients
3727135 during the first quarter we continued to see the impact of our new management team and marketing and branding strategies we continue to improve our relationships with our business partners and we are focused on our key suppliers as we look to increase our production rates to meet the steadily increasing demand for our products
3727136 new orders in q1 outpaced shipments as we received 20 million in new product orders and shipped 5 million in product this backlog increased 14 8 million to a company record of 42 7 million to put this in perspective we ended the first quarter of last year with 5 3 million in backlog and achieved 31 3 in total revenues this year we finished q1 of 2009 with more backlog than we shipped in all of 2008 and almost twice the number in fiscal 2007 if you measure this business by quarterly revenue and backlog combined you will see a much clearer picture of where this business is headed

3727138 i believe that significant market demand for our products will help us take an important step toward achieving our strategic goals of near term profitability and long term shareholder value i believe this year will be the best year in the history of the company

3727174 this latest product from henkel is but one more example of what ingenuity and cooperative partnership can achieve
3727175 our materials scientists working in close cooperation with mass imaging leader dek have developed a robust systems approach to deliver a complete offering that incorporates high performance manufacturable materials with a machine platform capable of ultra precise die attach deposition henkel strives to deliver risk free solutions that enable our customers competitiveness through a total process approach and this is in fact what the wbc project has achieved
3727176 current commercial ablestik wbc materials are used in production for single die configurations
3727177 however we are working on some novel application processes and have had success achieving coatings that are less than 10 microns thick it is certainly conceivable that our wbc technology will quickly become an alternative to film for stacked die applications as well
3727178 to meet the performance and efficiency demands of cutting edge applications such as controlling robotic systems testing wireless devices and designing hybrid vehicles users must have the ability to quickly incorporate the latest technologies such as multicore processors fpgas and wireless communication

3727226 saas is ideal for large corporations with dozens of internet gateways where deploying traditional point products is very expensive it is a good fit for small businesses which do not have enough it staff zscalers well designed in the cloud service with integrated functionality provides high security and granular control at low tco
3727227 wipro helps its global customers deploy robust risk management and governance solutions based on industry best practices we are seeing growing interest from our customers for the software as a service saas model as it provides a more cost effective alternative solution for enterprises to achieve regulatory compliance rather than implementing traditional packaged applications we are glad to partner with zscaler to provide comprehensive functionality using their saas model to deliver higher value and greater roi
3727228 we are not taking existing web proxies sticking them in a data center and calling it an in the cloud service
3727229 just as salesforce coms multi tenant architecture differentiated it from the current solutions zscalers architecture coupled with a global security network sets a new standard in the saas security space
3727230 the dpac 1000 further demonstrates adlinks leadership in distributed control solutions by providing an intelligent remote data acquisition controller which can collect data from both digital sensors such as discrete i o modules pressure sensors and temperature sensors and analog i o modules up to 4000 feet away this data acquisition controller is rated for used in high shock settings of up to 100 g for stable data logging even in harsh environments

3727240 i think the fear is that somehow large corporations will censor their content their points of view
3727241 i think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy which by the way would have a big first amendment problem
3727242 then whoever is in charge of government is going to determine what is fair under a so called fairness doctrine which wont be called that itll be called something else
3727243 so will web sites will bloggers have to give equal time or equal space on their web site to opposing views rather than letting the marketplace of ideas determine that

3727245 the gradient of time in the country and being born in the country or outside the country has a lot to do with how people perceive and experience the health care system and especially the deficits of that system
3727246 if you compare these numbers to those from the u s centers for disease control and prevention latinos are more than twice as likely to lack a usual health care provider
3727247 we found a number of characteristics of health care access that are particular to latinos
3727248 among people who have health insurance 19 percent lacked a usual health care provider compared to 42 percent of people who lack health insurance
3727249 this suggests that its not only financial reasons that are keeping latinos from doctors
3727250 among those people who reported they were not satisfied with their health care the most common reason why they received poor health care was financial
3727251 they felt that their health care professional did not provide good care because they did not have the means to pay for the health care

3727311 the mpc faced a difficult decision today in the face of rising inflationary pressures and a slowing economic outlook
3727312 holding the bank rate is better than raising rates as one mpc member suggested last month but a reduction would have been a welcome recognition of the current financial strains on households already struggling with hikes in other living costs
3727313 as a result of recent bank rate reductions mortgage rates are below their peak at the end of 2007 but many consumers will be looking to the mpc to respond soon to the slowing economy and reducing inflationary pressures
3727314 the number of people facing difficulty needs to be kept in perspective
3727315 but it is inevitable that more borrowers coping strategies will come under pressure in current conditions than in the unusually benign years of the last decade thats why lenders government and the advice sector are working closely together to minimise the impact on borrowers

3727323 i dont feel my questions have been answered with regard to edwards
3727324 he must hold firm to the sure word as taught so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to confute those who contradict it
3727325 we now know from conversations with bishops at lambeth that this was not something isolated to the bishop of lichfield but that other bishops at lambeth were given this misinformation as well
3727326 he must hold firm to the sure word as taught so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to confute those who contradict it
3727327 we all sat on the floor there was one wounded person with us and we were asked to pick up another person with injuries along the way before that we spent four days in a cellar with no gas or electricity all the cables had been ripped out and were lying on the ground
3727328 the situation is truly catastrophic here there are several hundred refugees in this village efforts are made to somehow transfer them to vladikavkaz but huge traffic jams block the roads
3727329 people are trying to leave in cars and new wounded people keep pouring into the village an aid post has been set up outside surgery takes place in the open air
3727330 yesterday at dusk villages located northwest and northeast from gori toward the direction of tskhinvali became a looting scene for various groupings and formations
3727331 people were calling governmental agencies the media asking for help the looters took everything money groceries cattle chicken everything
3727332 it was not completely finished yet but every i spent every single penny i had collected to built this house now i am homeless i dont know whats going to happen and what the government will do for poor people i hope they will think about us
3727333 i heard shots from jet fighters flying over our village my mom is in georgia she stayed with my dad i asked her to come but she said she was staying because my dad is in the war hes fighting
3727334 we are deep in the realm of disinformation which comes from both sides of the conflict and of propaganda from the media
3727335 the figures they give for the dead the injured about the civilian population and the displaced people are absolutely groundless
3727336 our teams have been trying since friday to get to south ossetia from tbilisi but its been very difficult to get there for security reasons
3727337 so we dont have any firsthand information yet on what the actual humanitarian situation is on the ground but from what were hearing it sounds very very serious and we are very much worried for the population
3727338 obviously the conflict between georgia and russia has affected the whole geopolitical structure
3727339 and many analysts and many observers many investors have wondered what is going to happen to the baku tbilisi ceyhan oil pipeline and to the baku tbilisi erzurum gas pipeline and to the european and american plans to enhance the role of the southern caucasus region for conveying strategic hydrocarbons toward the west
3727340 the alternative export route which is to take by rail or older pipelines oil from azerbaijan across to georgian ports that route has now been blocked by the destruction of those ports and blocking of those ports by russia
3727341 oil can be to a certain extent rerouted gas in terms of expanding gas production youd really have to have a dedicated energy transit route and were thinking about nabucco which is of course europes plan for bringing additional gas from turkmenistan into europe
3727342 it would pass through basically the same route as the bte pipeline
3727343 due to the recent blast on the pipeline in turkey 20 000 tons of oil were lost and then there were the alleged attacks on the pipeline in georgia
3727344 all these prove that the risks are still there and they have increased after the latest conflict this prompts the three countries on the pipeline route to reconsider the security system and take new measures greater security also serves the interests of companies and governments
3727345 if things move in positive directions politically if things seem more stable it may be that some of these things like shipping oil through the georgian ports or expanding the btc pipeline do become possible again so its a bit speculative at this point
3727346 dont fuck with me i have 51 brothers and sisters
3727347 this foray into the world of advertising and marketing communication thrills me and challenges me embarking on the path i see myself unreservedly opening my mind to new experiences and achievements and a new name is appropriate
3727348 malo is by joining frieze films giving the advertising community an opportunity to work with someone who is expressive about south africa in a unique way and also experienced in film and extracting sensitive real performances
3727349 i know that one of my strengths as a director of films and documentaries is the ability to look at an event through the eyes of my subjects and then portray these events in a way that has the most impact on my audience
3727350 im certain that this skill will be put to good use in the advertising industry and im looking forward to the challenge of getting to know some of south africas favourite brands a little better and collaborating with agencies and creative directors to bring their visions and storyboards to life
3727351 while the plants copper production during the quarter was in line with our may 14 forecast cobalt output was less than expected
3727352 this together with current assessments of the time required to add needed residue filtration capacity at the plant make it prudent to reduce our production outlook for 2008
3727353 precipitated a horrendously tragic event which has impacted many individuals
3727354 your discretionary release at this time would thus not be compatible with the welfare of society at large

3727367 we arent the type of club who can go out and buy big we know we have to identify players who will come in and enhance our squad but who are also within our budget
3727368 that is why we tend to look at the lower leagues and players who have got a hunger and desire to make a name for themselves in the top flight or experienced players where for one reason or another things havent worked out for them at other clubs
3727369 i am happy that steve finnan has agreed to return to international football he is an experienced player and he still has a lot to give to the team

3727382 now she has some kind of timescale for blakes release it has given her some focus she wants something to impress him with because he has accused her of just sitting around doing nothing while he has been serving time
3727383 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way
3727384 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
3727385 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
3727386 without a doubt some press didnt see it that way
3727387 poor reputation for insensitivity toward racial issues has been further harmed
3727388 we have great respect for the far east and its people some of my best friends in toronto are originally chinese including one of our sponsors the brand li ning

3727407 many of us in the technology community have done a poor job of communicating to the general public why they should care about these issues with geekpac we hope to change that by driving thought leadership in this area and building a critical mass of concerned citizens who will be able to get the attention of their local politicians
3727408 mccain is a strong christian he believes that in the context of the campaign his faith is a personal issue
3727409 when the story of michael vicks dog fighting business came out the general public was given a glimpse of the sadistic world of dog fighting
3727410 they were horrified to learn that dog fighters not only force these animals to fight to the death many also engage in violence against the dogs by means of electrocution strangulation kicking and other unimaginable acts of cruelty the public had known there were evil people out there who trained dogs to fight but it took a big media event to take the barbaric practice of dog fighting to the forefront of their consciousness
3727411 in a sense the vick case was a blessing in the fact that its brought this issue to light that this is happening in our society
3727412 people are learning about the cruelty many pit bulls are forced to endure and more people are turning in suspected dog fighting operations we cant let this issue fall out of the public eye and thats why we are thrilled to partner with andrei the pit bull arlovski
3727413 in the coming weeks andrei will begin working very closely with for pits sake and the knock out dog fighting program and getting all of the interested arlovski com members involved as well

3727417 about a year ago we became convinced that the rdf data model and linked data techniques offered the first pragmatic solution to the historical data silo problem of unconnected data
3727418 the only missing piece was how to bring context to that data and so we started the umbel project
3727419 the umbel project with its need to capture the open world aspects of the web has brought a fresh perspective and set of challenges to cyc
3727420 we are excited by the release and committed to supporting umbel as part of our overall web relevance strategy
3727421 we see umbel as a useful gateway to the more sophisticated reasoning and other tools surrounding cyc
3727422 the participation and responsiveness of cycorp and the cyc foundation have been absolutely essential to the quality of umbel
3727423 umbel is a major addition to the burgeoning linked data web
3727424 it provides a coherent data dictionary that meshes naturally with the dbpedia project openlink co founded nearly two years ago
3727425 this data dictionary orientation of umbel also increases the palatability of linked data to the closed world realm of enterprise data spaces reducing the pain associated with the timeless quest for data integration

3727442 still all g7 central banks are now worried about the temporary rise in headline inflation so for now they are all on hold or threatening to hike policy rates to fight potential inflation risks but over time severe recession risks and the risk of a severe banking and financial crisis with credit losses now estimated to be at least 1 trillion and possibly as high as 2 trillions and hundreds of banks going bust will force all g7 central banks to cut further policy rates but this policy easing will be too slow and delayed especially outside the us and will occur only when the g7 and global recession will become entrenched thus the policy response to this upcoming perfect storm will be too little too late to prevent it

3727445 it just seems to me that edwards might be attracted to a woman whose mouth did something other than talk
3727446 weve been told that elizabeth edwards is smarter than john edwards thats part of the puff pieces on them that weve seen ergo if elizabeth edwards is smarter than john edwards is it likely that she thinks she knows better than he does what his speeches ought to contain and what kind of things he ought to be doing strategy wise in the campaign if she is smarter than he is could it have been her decision to keep going with the campaign in other words could it be that she doesnt shut up now thats as far as im going to go
3727447 my theory that i just explained to you about why you know what could have john edwards motivations been to have the affair with rielle hunter given his wife is smarter than he is and probably nagging him a lot about doing this and he found somebody that did something with her mouth other than talk

3727521 cyberbullying is a relatively new phenomenon as is social networking
3727522 it is therefore not surprising that there have been relatively few prosecutions in this area
3727523 as a tool to address all manner of cyber crimes
3727524 moreover the vehicle for the cyberbullying at issue here a social networking web site only became mainstream after 2000

3727566 katrina has signed the deal with nakshatra for a whopping amount
3727567 we made a lot of changes tonight and for the right reasons because one or two of our players are carrying knocks we had enough out there to win the game though and in the first half we could have won three games
3727568 we created plenty of chances and hit the crossbar three times we had a massive amount of possession too much possession in the end because we passed the ball side to side rather than go direct with it
3727569 rotherham defended extremely well but they reacted to conceding a goal very quickly they scored immediately after we had scored and we had been so much on top of the game
3727570 that really disappointed me because five people could have affected that before it went in the back of the net those people know that i am not happy with that and it wont happen again you cant switch off and expect the opposition not to attack you they will attack you if you let them
3727571 ive seen that kind of thing happen so many times before to the best player on the pitch football can be unbelievably cruel at times
3727572 we havent had any strikers at our disposal and so it was difficult to impose ourselves against chelsea or manchester city because we had no goal threat
3727573 if you dont have strikers it completely changes the way you play and the team is constantly under pressure
3727574 our friendlies could certainly have gone better but we also have to remember who we have played against and the oppositions preparations
3727575 i was delighted to get a goal on my debut shane long did ever so well down the left he put a great ball in i managed to get to the back post and stuck it in
3727576 it was a typical cup game as the home side dagenham were pushing but we defended well and when we got it down we caused problems it was great to get the sucker punch on them id already hit the bar so tried to keep my head up and make sure i didnt miss next time
3727577 noel had three or four other strikes one hit the bar and hes always there or thereabouts hes got an instinct for scoring and i hope that continues because you need goals to win games
3727578 hes desperate to make an impression here and long may that continue

3727601 developing a partnership with sdu considered a top 10 mba program in china and the flagship university for the shandong province was one of our first choices but we did not initially have any contacts there
3727602 it turns out that dr qing cao of uconns department of management had worked with dr hongping zhang of the sdu management sciences department during a one year post doc so we were able to utilize her contact and build a relationship
3727603 these courses have been offered for many years and expose students to the cultural and corporate differences and similarities between the us and china
3727604 if we want to be truly considered an international university then i strongly believe partnerships such as this one are excellent advances toward that goal

3727643 die pers nlichen patientenbesuche haben im rahmen unserer medizinischen betreuung sehr gro e bedeutung rzte und pflegepersonal ben tigen dabei jedoch am krankenbett einen sicheren und m glichst schnellen zugang zu allen relevanten informationen bisher musste sich jeder einzelne benutzer komplett aus dem system abmelden bevor sich der n chste benutzer f r einen zugriff anmelden konnte f r ein und denselben patienten dies konnte mehrere minuten dauern mit dem schnellen benutzerwechsel k nnen wir diesen aufwand vermeiden und effizienter arbeiten unsere mitarbeiter erhalten jetzt in sekundenschnelle einen einfachen und sicheren zugang zu den patientendaten

3727647 the closing words between parents and children are crucial whatever wisdom you have to offer whether it is i love you im behind you im proud of you say it if you cant express yourself verbally write your thoughts down and mail the letter to your child immediately after you arrive home your children will remember your messages and hold on to them
3727648 younger siblings may be quite happy to see the older child leave home ive heard stories of younger children who usually have stayed in their rooms suddenly appearing at the dinner table if the college bound student is your youngest youll begin to reestablish a one on one relationship with your spouse after years of parenting
3727649 your child will arrive home with a whole new set of habits particularly when it comes to food and sleep
3727650 the students room is home base try not to change it very much during his or her first semester away
3727651 the temptation is to intervene when a child calls home with a problem remember that many resources exist at college to help students cope with various situations express support but give your children time to solve their own problems it will ultimately benefit them colleges have many safety nets including resident advisers who are trained to identify and handle just about any problem you can imagine
3727652 perfect 4 0s or higher with ap grades are commonplace in high school very few students make it through a challenging and varied college curriculum with a perfect 4 0 at emory for example there might be only one or two out of a graduating class of 1100 expect early gpas to be low and later ones to be better brand new college freshmen are actually successful high school students who are at college they need time and experience to learn how to be college students at college this takes at least one semester be patient and understanding
3727653 as freshmen students tend to highlight everything in their textbooks because everything seems important sophomores highlight several lines on a page as they begin to zero in on the heart of the matter juniors just highlight a line here or there seniors sometimes highlight nothing they just write critical comments in the margin and cite other sources of reference by the childs junior year you will realize youre dealing with an expanded and exciting mind be patient in waiting to see the effects of the college experience
3727654 like having a car without the key to run it you re not going to get anywhere you really need to go

3727656 many schoolchildren learn how rivers meander and form ox bow lakes but these processes are still very poorly understood when it comes to submarine channels these channels are built by currents carrying large volumes of sediment and seem to be far more stable and far less likely to meander or form ox bow lakes than those on land
3727657 the sands and gravels deposited by these sub sea giants have in many cases trapped valuable accumulations of fossil fuels
3727658 what the companies have to do is make estimations using very limited data anything that can give them a clearer picture of where to find the oil and gas will be very valuable
3727659 an individual production well may cost over 50m so understanding and predicting the distribution of the different rock types that hold these hydrocarbons is critical for optimising well type and location and therefore producing more of the oil
3727660 in most oilfields they dont manage to recover all the oil and gas in some cases most is actually left in the ground from both an economic and an environmental point of view it makes sense to get as much as you can out
3727661 understanding the differences between submarine channels and rivers will enable improved geological models and enhanced oil production from these giants of the deep
3727662 the gw school of business is home to numerous faculty members who are the best in their fields it is really nice to see one of our faculty being recognized by the industry in which she has focused her teaching and research

3727664 i am very honored to be included in this prestigious group of colleagues and look forward to continuing to educate future leaders in the industry
3727665 no school no work the world cant wait drive out the bush regime
3727666 the problem was that he did not disclose his association with the case that seems like pertinent information the fact that almost every other site reporting on this matter do not disclose this and position duffy as totally unbiased to this issue is telling
3727667 its up to the readers and others to do the research and figure it out
3727668 who is this guy and what is his affilitation with the issue s
3727669 its up to the readers and others to do the research and figure it out
3727670 really you honestly think that theres no ethical questions in not disclosing a conflict of interest i just dont see how that is perhaps its because i deal with plenty of writers who know that the most fundamental point is to disclose any potential conflicts
3727671 well our intended audience should know were biased so we dont need to disclose conflicts of interest
3727672 well our intended audience should know were biased so we dont need to disclose conflicts of interest

3727675 the pto s new interpretation of patentable subject matter provides a clear avenue to reject patent applications and to invalid issued patents on all patents on innovative computer implemented processes without regard to how meritorious or creative the innovation is
3727676 duffy pointed to googles pagerank patent or license rather because google is considered a great innovator and the pagerank system is considered truly inventive and unique to google duffy was not using googles name for recognition purposes he was using googles patent as an example of something deserving patent protection
3727677 actually its not most of the truly unique work for pagerank was done prior to page brins work by jon kleinberg at mit page brin simply updated his work in a rather marginal way
3727678 well if most of our readers know this conflict theres no reason to disclose

3727702 we have not received any positive reply from new zealand cricket nzc and heavy rains in punjab where the three matches were planned did not make the series a possibility
3727703 it is disappointing but we cannot do much about that
3727704 early indications are that these criminals have been tampering with retailers chip and pin terminals in order to steal card transaction data and pins from these machines
3727705 to date compromised chip and pin terminals have been found in less than 30 retail outlets throughout the uk together with the banking and retail industries we are working to ensure this figure is minimised
3727706 in the unlikely event a cardholder is an innocent victim of this or any type of fraud they enjoy excellent protection under the banking code which means that they will not suffer any financial loss
3727707 now its not just cash machines its every card reader in every shop or restaurant

3727711 lhomme tant issu de la nature le bon sens lui dicte de vivre en accord avec elle survivre nous sera impossible si nous continuons nous acharner sur la nature
3727712 we doen er alles aan om die situatie deze keer te voorkomen
3727713 we doen er altijd alles aan om te zorgen dat er niets uitlekt maar deze keer is het echt hysterisch harde schijven die worden vernietigd en alles erop en eraan
3727714 de eindredacteur had de fotos al bijna gewist uit zijn mailbox nog voordat ik ze had gezien

3727717 quietly stepping up counterterror efforts out of a growing concern that al qaeda or similar organizations might try to capitalize on the spate of extremely high profile events in the coming months
3727718 this is an error commonly made by someone who is not fluent in written english
3727719 it would not be right to offer the prospect of self handling or self selection of a quayside handling contractor to a t2 terminal two operator whilst denying the same opportunity to those remaining in t1 terminal one
3727720 the proposed changes will result in the transfer of approximately 190 staff directly employed by dover harbour board which represents about one third of the full time workforce
3727721 as a former officer on dovers cross channel ferries im very much aware of the important role played by the berthing gangs the tug drivers and the security officers
3727722 the hiving off of these services to private operators will impact negatively on employees conditions of service and on safety
3727723 the local union reps and the work force has worked tirelessly to co operate with dover harbour board and it beggars belief that that they should be rewarded with this unilateral board decision to terminate their employment
3727724 the dover harbour boards action is a betrayal of their loyal workforce

3727742 im not giving up i wont concede ill keep the focus of the media and the people on me me meeee
3727743 it is not untrue to say flights are usually more expensive from an online travel agent that has screen scraped ryanair fares we have no issue with that but lets say it how it is ryanair is forcing consumers to go to its website because it wants to sell a whole plethora of products from there flights are the hook
3727744 we know from our own price comparative work that ryanair is not always the cheapest for hotels car hire and travel insurance products so consumers should shop around for the best deal if buying such products online
3727745 theres no point in doing this for third party sites we wouldnt promote bringing a visitor to our site and pushing them to another one where the sale is made we would go out of business very quickly if we did that the whole reason for a travel agents existence is to resell
3727746 you have to ask yourself why no other airline has a problem with screen scraping in fact a lot will negotiate lower prices with online agents because they value the business they create for the airlines and they want to incentivise us to sell more
3727747 and by the way when can we change our vocabulary enough to recognize that defecit spending is a tax

3727774 the federal marriage amendment fma also known as the marriage protection amendment is a proposed amendment to the united states constitution which would define marriage in the united states as a union of one man and one woman the fma also would prevent judicial extension of marriage rights to same sex or other unmarried couples as well as preventing people from having multiple spouses the most recent vote to take place on the proposed amendment occurred in the united states house of representatives on july 18 2006 when the amendment failed 236 yea to 187 nay votes falling short of the 290 yea votes required for passage the senate has only voted on cloture motions with regards to the proposed amendment the last of which was on june 7 2006 when the motion failed 49 yea to 48 nay votes falling short of the 60 yea votes required to proceed to consideration of the amendment
3727775 he has really lived and breathed it which is why it comes across so authentically
3727776 so why is the senator being advised to play to the dopes in the middle
3727777 fixating on and pandering to this fickle crowd is all about messaging tailored to avoid offending rather than to inspire and galvanize and isnt galvanizing the electorate to demand fundamental change the raison detre of the obama campaign in the first place watering down that brand is the political equivalent of new coke call it obama zero
3727778 we dont have to worry about iraq turning into another vietnam because we have an exit strategy
3727779 black people got a lot of gall causing so much fuss after we gave them all that free luxury cruise from west africa
3727780 you know its hot down here in the south too hot for white people to actually work out in the sun but those colored people they just love to spend the whole day out in the cotton field picking cotton they love it so much that if we had not sent the ships they would have walked across the ocean just for the opportunity to pick some cotton and be abused and treated like a farm animal
3727781 represented north carolina as though blacks were not voting he has always been a voice for nativist white conservatives in north carolina
3727782 i have been too lax too long in doing something really significant about aids
3727783 christ only speaks about judgment once and its not about sex but about how we deal with the poor and i quoted matthew i was naked and you clothed me i was hungry and you fed me jesse got very emotional and the next day he brought in the reporters and publicly repented about aids i explained to him that aids was like the leprosy of the new testament
3727784 senator bill frist and i were allies in creating and passing a bill to commit 200 million to fight aids in africa
3727785 senator helms leaves behind a strong legacy of fighting for the freedoms that make america great
3727786 josh mcneil has a great awareness and really understands how to play the position
3727787 this is my fourth season coming up ive definitely come a long way since coming in as a freshman and getting knocked around and all that stuff now im out there playing on saturdays its definitely been a long transition but its been fun
3727788 obviously for a center the mental part is really hard that took a little while but the biggest challenge was getting bigger physically and getting into the weight room to be able to handle those guys you go up against on saturdays
3727789 the first couple of days i was a little rusty because i was getting back into the swing of things
3727790 that was the first game type situation ive been in since wisconsin im back to where i need to be
3727791 ive got so many things i need to look at if he notices a minor detail that i miss he can just turn around and give me a little heads up for it
3727792 i was absolutely not cut out for a life of crime
3727793 and i was quite incompetent at it i deserved the punishment but punishment technically ends at some point society says it doesnt and that lasts for the rest of your life it follows you around like a legacy
3727794 he is a former inmate convicted of armed robbery at green hills
3727795 the fact that he shot at a father and a son is lost he now works for a union funded company
3727796 i admire people who devote their lives to causes to saving whales the environment child abuse
3727797 what im saying is that cca is for profit and it colors their decision
3727798 it was a harsh introduction to the system but i committed a harsh crime
3727799 it doesnt achieve less crime less victimization theres increased recidivism and an increased amount of people in prison
3727800 you have to go all the way you have to work hard to reach the goals you set according to what you believe
3727801 he is brilliant and ive worked with him in different capacities

3727809 shes got his eyes jaw line and lips but she does have rielles nose my niece is not a bastard child i just dont think its right
3727810 the most shocking thing was watching him on tv giving half truths these half baked answers i wish for everyone involved that hed come clean
3727811 a big hug and apologize im very ashamed my sister had an affair with a public man shes not the first person to make this mistake and wont be the last
3727812 i was kind of fascinated by her and her friends
3727813 i saw them as a tribe that i wanted to study
3727814 is about a group of girls five or six friends coming to new york and conquering or failing to conquer the city
3727815 how would you like to help in designing the look of series 3 specifically youd be helping us choose the stuff that litters the main set im talking about posters comics fanzines t shirts anything youve seen in the last few months that you think is pretty cool or captures the spirit of the show or a particular character
3727816 the main factor in our decision was whether we wanted to make dominic participate in a prosecution where his father could be put to death
3727817 denver county jurors are perhaps the most reluctant in the entire state to actually vote for the death penalty
3727818 our state in recent years has been a state which prosecutors have difficulty getting the ultimate sanction of death imposed
3727819 not the sort of situation where the death penalty is generally sought or obtained in colorado
3727820 even though this crime was horrific phillips did not have any felony history and this case was not charged as murder after deliberation
3727821 the falconry experience by the hotel hershey will acquaint participants with the history of mans relationship with raptors and the evolution of falconry it will include free flight demonstrations a simulated hunt demonstration and an opportunity for participants to hold a majestic bird of prey the program will be run by master falconer jack hubley
3727822 there is obviously no way to quantify this but i regard bill clinton as the most thoroughly humiliated person in all of human history who else even comes close
3727823 we soon learned that jesse jackson wasnt paying attention nor was former new york gov eliot spitzer or sen larry craig or motown mayor kwame kilpatrick last week another name was added to the ranks of the obviously inattentive the golden boy himself former north carolina senator john edwards
3727824 maybe 20 pages if it hasnt grabbed me by then im out of there
3727825 not just the levees broke my life before and after katrina
3727826 i truly believe that home is where the heart is and when you say new orleans you might as well say my heart this city is for people who really love it really want to see it come back im one of those people
3727827 you swim faster in bvds because the stripes go up and down
3727828 i have heard from other district attorneys in other parts of the state who had pressure with people telling them youre going to financially break us
3727829 there was a discussion of actually raising the millage rate to pay for the trials
3727830 i think eventually thats something that the death penaltys proponents and opponents could agree on its just too darn expensive
3727831 would probably reduce the number of murder cases where the death penalty is sought
3727832 it would not be right to talk about these things
3727833 threat to the whole world order and there are many actions to be made in the realm of intelligence and preventive measures
3727834 does not see an action against iran as the right thing to do at the moment

3727838 anyway i have achieved everything i wanted to in the past four years and i am very grateful for that
3727839 i was supposed to go out there and attack at all times it didnt work
3727840 this is the end of my career although it wasnt a good fight i went through a lot of pain its the end of my amateur boxing i am now going to turn professional
3727841 as i speak russian tanks are attacking the town of gori
3727842 traditionally we will see a few skirmishes but frontal attacks and positioning will end
3727843 the hands of the criminals have hit in tripoli against innocent soldiers and civilians
3727844 once again they want our country to be an arena for settling scores and battling for influence
3727845 the wounded were lying on the ground men in military uniforms
3727846 got scared and he ran over here he was bleeding
3727847 i kept telling him you dont want to do this
3727848 we recognise that uncertainty will remain on bookings for summer 2009 until the end of 2008 early 2009 and after a 40 percent bounce over the last month think that some profit taking is possible
3727849 the main holiday is a must have item for consumers in our experience people will cut back on all sorts of other things before they cut back on their holiday
3727850 conscious that despite good initial bookings concerns over the consumer outlook for 2009 are unlikely to go away
3727851 it solidifies us as the place to go for the cool stuff
3727852 we do believe that broadening our assortment and having iphone in our stores is certainly going to be very important

3727856 five years ago there were lots and lots of people whod never heard of a churro and many of the people who did know what one was had had one at disneyland or at a ballpark
3727857 ill tip my hat to them they familiarized the american people with churros and gave people that first wonderful experience
3727858 theyre sold in the mornings by women who carry large flat baskets on their heads
3727859 these churros are made at home and brought into the market to sell still hot and covered with granulated sugar
3727860 the menu is churros and four kinds of hot chocolate and thats it
3727861 i am so wild about churros theyre one of my favorite things in the whole wide world
3727862 this is the kind of cease fire that i dont know they had with afghanistan i guess in 1979
3727863 there is no cease fire they russian forces are moving around
3727864 i tell you with full responsibility that there are no russian tanks in gori today and there is no reason to be
3727865 georgia has been sticking to its commitments but i dont think there is much to stick to here
3727866 the georgian side must immediately fulfill this key issue to remove all dangers concerning relapses
3727867 prevent any aggressive ambitions on the part of the georgian leadership
3727868 let the world finally wake up and take the action and provide the real security for the region
3727869 this is the first time that weve actually seen an invasion a unilateral invasion of a country
3727870 i think we have to think about this long and hard and deeply in the eu and in nato

3727873 ive got three races left so there had better be something left in the tank
3727874 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3727875 there is nobody in our sport that can win like he wins
3727876 he is not just winning he is crunching world records
3727877 he was saying to me i think ive figured out michael phelps
3727878 its the most fun thing to be in a team environment and be part of a relay its cool when you get four americans who all swim well together everyone has to play their part or its just not going to happen weve been lucky that weve been able to do that
3727879 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3727880 any medal in an event that is not on your regular program is great
3727881 i went out there and i raced tough and thats all i can do
3727882 it was definitely a tough day but i think i handled it pretty well
3727883 if it means staying in this country for six months i will do that
3727884 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source if gasoline prices fall alternative fuels and the cost to convert fleets over to them become less and less attractive
3727885 girlfriend the country just aint into you like that why dont you go sit down

3727888 we are puzzled it is sad this is not the scott we knew

3727890 we learned from that mistake and we proved that we learned from that mistake based on our performance in the last four elections

3727894 ya que los 435 millones de euros que iban destinados a las comunidades aut nomas se han quedado en 241 millones de euros
3727895 si el gobierno es partidario de no hacer recortes en las pol ticas sociales y de la sociedad del bienestar tal y como el propio zapatero viene afirmando debe afrontar su responsabilidad y dotar de los recursos necesarios a las comunidades aut nomas que prestan los servicios de la sanidad la educaci n y los servicios sociales

3727909 form and function are critical for surgical devices and innovation begins with direct input from those who will be using them
3727910 solidworks saved us research and development time because it allowed us to rapidly fabricate multiple prototypes and trial them in parallel with surgeons the software enabled us to easily build feedback into our products to ensure we achieved performance objectives
3727911 solidworks allowed us to keep manufacturability and ergonomics in mind as we constantly refined the system throughout product development
3727912 developing new medical technologies makes a profound difference in peoples lives
3727913 peak surgical is yet another example of an upstart company that has made an innovative concept a beneficial medical reality using solidworks software

3727921 countrywide made loans to west virginia consumers on terms that were unaffordable and unconscionable
3727922 these loans exposed consumers to foreclosure and loss of their homes countrywide also used unfair and deceptive acts or practices to make loans and service loans
3727923 foreclosures in a neighborhood affect the value of all homes in that neighborhood
3727924 therefore while the consumers facing foreclosure are directly affected by countrywides practices all homeowners are indirectly affected

3727955 di tre cose ero del tutto certa primo edward era un vampiro secondo una parte di lui chiss quale e quanto importante aveva sete del mio sangue terzo ero totalmente incondizionatamente innamorata di lui
3727956 quando la carta mi tagli il dito lo alzai per esaminare il danno dalla ferita invisibile colava una minuscola goccia di sangue poi accadde tutto molto velocemente edward si lanci verso di me scagliandomi dallaltra parte del tavolo ero caduta vicino al pianoforte gettando le braccia in avanti per proteggermi in mezzo alle schegge di vetro affilate dal polso al gomito ormai il dolore minvadeva acuto e bruciante confusa e disorientata cercai di non badare al rosso vivo del sangue che mi colava dal braccio e incrociai gli sguardi eccitati di sei vampiri improvvisamente famelici
3727957 nel silenzio assoluto unintuizione improvvisa rimise ogni dettaglio al suo posto cera qualcosa di cui edward non aveva voluto parlarmi qualcosa che jacob non mi avrebbe tenuta nascosta qualcosa che aveva attirato i cullen e i lupi nella foresta e li aveva fatti avvicinare pericolosamente tuttavia stavo aspettando proprio quel momento lo temevo ed ero pronta ad affrontarlo malgrado desiderassi con tutta me stessa che non arrivasse mai ma i miei guai non potevano aver fine vero

3728000 this opportunistic proposal is an attempt to acquire lonmins assets cheaply and capitalise on the expected improvement in our mining and processing performance

3728017 das sagen die nur um die t ter unter druck zu setzen dass sie einen zeugen haben der auspacken k nnte

3728024 we won three out of 4 but we didnt win the one that counted this means well have to regroup and try again because we still have the same need out there
3728025 it appears that everybody agrees we need a new jail and new communication equipment but they are not in agreement as to how well go about paying for it
3728026 obviously with any new website there are problems so hopefully well iron them out as quickly as possible
3728027 it is up to citizens to use them and not just moan in comments to silicon com
3728028 but the fact is that seriously no one cares about the quality of their code they do for some american company which they dont know much about

3728030 he didnt go to tibet and meet cool people but it was very similar in vibe
3728031 in my version there was actually a new villain it wasnt one of the classics which is probably why they didnt use it it was more of a hannibal lecter type he was somebody already in arkham asylum that bruce went and sort of studied with
3728032 it was a whole thing i get very emotional about it i still love the story maybe ill get to do it as a comic one day
3728033 it afforded me the opportunity to raise my family and still go to school if nursing is what you want to do keep your goals in mind and be prepared to sacrifice a lot because its all worth it in the end
3728034 the course was nice because i learned on my own
3728035 im an independent thinker this course is an emotional rollercoaster just when you are excited about something anything can happen take time for yourself because of the emotional aspect of it all
3728036 i learn through direction so it was a life altering experience
3728037 you have to be prepared to literally give up everything for the next year and a half dont give up and work hard this has been beneficial to me and im so glad its over
3728038 this program gave me the opportunity to get my degree while raising my family
3728039 it was very difficult and a demanding program that was a wonderful experience i loved being able to work at the phoe nixville hospital with their staff a lot of hands on training experience the staff was very supportive especially the 5th floor they were very accommodating to us
3728040 people are now looking at nursing as a career change
3728041 students are established and having had careers and a family weve found an alternative way to teach this education this is different from an associates degree program in some colleges
3728042 we wanted to build a curriculum that would assist those with families we went with a virtual classroom instead of a traditional one this allows the perspective student to stay at home and learn online all of our students will have to take the national board exam and they must pass to receive their degree
3728043 students can participate in online chats and message boards about their class
3728044 the clinical portion is the same where the student goes to the hospital and treats patients the instructor schedules the clinical aspect so that the student can come in and learn how to treat patients
3728045 im more prepared with things instead of flying by the seat of my pants
3728046 everything in general its spilled over into my personal life
3728047 one thing i didnt expect was to get four good friends out of it
3728048 mrs fox has been great and we meshed with her very well
3728049 i know i was going to get critical thinking skills
3728050 it affects my decision making in my personal and professional lives
3728051 students will have five semesters of clinical before they can graduate which is 15 weeks per semester
3728052 entry time for classes are january and august the january class will be working with registered nurses by this time next year while another class will begin they will be assigned a registered nurse to a specific area and then go through a rotation of other specialties to get the experience and to expose themselves to other areas of the hospital once the group is ready to graduate theyll be eligible to take the national council licensure examination for registered nurses nclex rn
3728053 they were wonderful and will go on to be awesome nurses they worked hard during this entire program it was neat seeing them come in as individuals and work to be a cohesive unit they will be life long friends

3728056 welche erbanlagen es allerdings genau sind ist aber noch nicht bekannt
3728057 wir arbeiten in dem verbundprojekt daran die risikofaktoren besser zu erkennen und festzustellen welche faktoren chronische entz ndungen von zahnfleisch oder kiefer f rdern
3728058 das sollte unter anderem zu effektiveren therapien und zu neuen m glichkeiten der diagnostik f hren

3728060 die erholung der buckelwal population ist direkt auf den walfang stopp zur ckzuf hren
3728061 das ist eigentlich eine ziemliche deutliche antwort von allen gro walen sind die buckelwale diejenigen die am besten gedeihen wenn man sie in ruhe l t
3728062 japans regierung hatte im november 2007 beschlossen eine quote von 50 buckelwalen zu fangen
3728063 die buckelwale die die japaner t ten wollten sind jene mit denen die staaten gutes geld beim wal beobachten erzielen
3728064 auch wenn sich die best nde erholt haben sind sie immer noch meilenweit davon entfernt auch nur ann hernd jene zahl zu erreichen die sie vor dem anfang des kommerziellen walfangs hatten
3728065 das ergebnis war erstaunlich denn diese sippschaft die aus rund 50 tieren bestand blieb unter sich
3728066 was w rde geschehen wenn mich eine kugel oder ein schrapnell tr fe an beinen und armen konnte ich mir selbst helfen aber was wenn eine kugel die seitenwand durchschlug und mich im r cken oder im hintern traf
3728067 es ist uns erstmalig gelungen wichtige materialeigenschaften dieses sensors im nanobereich zu messen um damit unser modell der wirkungsweise weiter zu best tigen
3728068 insgesamt gibt es im insektenreich nur vier solcher bekannten infrarotsensoren zwei davon in australischen k fern die allerdings nach v llig anderen prinzipien arbeiten und eines bei einer wanze deren wirkweise hnlich dem des prachtk fers ist
3728069 die zahl ist nicht wissenschaftlich belegt fest steht allerdings dass der sensor so empfindlich ist dass der k fer den brand aus mehreren kilometern entfernung detektieren kann
3728070 es ist uns aber gelungen der wirkweise dieses sensors der etwa f nfmal schneller als technische infrarot f hler arbeitet n her zu kommen
3728071 die sinneszelle mit der er das tut ist ein typischer mechanorezeptor wie er beispielsweise auch in vielen geh rorganen von insekten etwa bei heuschrecken oder grillen zum einsatz kommt
3728072 der druckbeh lter dessen einzig weiche stelle die spitze der sinneszelle ist die wie ein handschuhfinger in ihn hineinragt misst nur ein drittel der dicke eines menschlichen haares
3728073 das faszinierende an diesem mechanismus ist dass der k fer diese spannungs nderungen schon wenige tausendstel sekunden nach dem infrarot puls registriert
3728074 weve been losing too many games in the seventh inning and later
3728075 i came in and just didnt get the job done
3728076 were getting him checked out were very suspicious hes not right
3728077 hes not right i know that for a fact i dont know if hes hurt but hes not right
3728078 it was a good win because it was a total team effort we battled from the start it something that we havent done in a long time
3728079 i made a couple of mistakes but i was able to make the rest of my pitches
3728080 the big thing was that i didnt let that first home run bother me
3728081 it was a good pitch that he hit if you let things like that get to you you never get yourself straight
3728082 dazu muss man allerdings die sprache der nervenzellen verstehen das bedeutet dass man das muster ihrer elektrischen aktivit t interpretieren muss
3728083 eine schwierigkeit dabei ist das signal einer einzelnen zelle aus den signalen tausender nachbarzellen herauszufiltern ein einzelnes signal ber viele wochen hinweg zu verfolgen ist nahezu unm glich
3728084 damit blieb eine schonende aber auch aussagekr ftige langzeitbeobachtung der aktivit t einzelner nervenzellen weiterhin ein wunschtraum
3728085 da tn xxl st ndig von den nervenzellen nachgebildet wird ist die leuchtkraft kontinuierlich hoch
3728086 die l sung des r tsels ist dass diese wanzen einen dicken schmierigen sekretfilm ausscheiden der als anti haft schicht wirkt und sie ganz locker ber die klebrigen h rchen der pflanze wandern l t
3728087 bei der pflanze handelt es sich um eine pr karnivore art die keine verdauungsenzyme bildet und daher die gefangenen insekten nicht verdauen kann sie ern hrt sich allerdings vom kot der weichwanzen
3728088 wir waren v llig erstaunt als wir das blatt wieder entrollten und die wanze unbehelligt weiterspazierte wo andere insekten total verklebt und h ngen geblieben w ren
3728089 unter dem kryo rasterelektronenmikroskop konnten wir sehen dass diese schicht mit 620 nanometern 30 mal dicker war als beispielsweise bei der schmei fliege die zu den typischen beuteinsekten der pflanze geh rt

3728100 the nigerian government asked virgin some years ago to set up a national carrier for nigeria that nigerians could put their trust in and be proud of virgin agreed to help enable this to happen but made it clear that they would only invest considerable sums in nigeria under certain strictcriteria
3728101 one of those was the ability to operate domestic and international flights out of the same terminal which is the only way a flag carrier of any country can operate
3728102 to my utter dismay certain authorities in nigeria have chosen to ignore our contract sending in heavies a few months ago to smash up our domestic lounge with sledgehammers in an attempt to intimidate the airline

3728383 the only claim she young has made to support standing is that she is a resident of meigs county living near racine

3728392 this is a loss of the palestinian voice the palestinian vision
3728393 somehow we felt that as long as there is mahmoud darwish there is a sense of goodness a sense of hope a sense of possibility for salvation
3728394 he left a legacy of poetry behind him he is immortal in our hearts
3728395 darwish has managed to break many of the taboos between the occupier and the people who resist the occupation
3728396 darwish was palestine personified in a man a man full of love nationalism and passion
3728397 i wept as i never did before and i will weep every time i read or recall one of his great poems
3728398 the story of our people is your story mahmud and by our meeting it was made more complete and more beautiful

3728409 she trained for the descent not the climb because that was going to be her weakness
3728410 it was a rolling course and emma was eighth so we said you know what the olympic course is much more mountainous so if we really focus on this how much more progress could we make
3728411 we pulled together a group of specialists coaches psychologists bike experts into a kind of commando unit we called it project pooley
3728412 we developed a completely different bike that allowed her to make use of her very small size which is fantastic for going up hills but not much good for coming down when it is about power
3728413 the problem was there was not a lot of proprietary equipment out there on the mainstream market that was small enough
3728414 so we developed something special for her that allows her to get into that really tucked position coming down because her advantage is that being small she doesnt hit a lot of air
3728415 she did brilliantly as she took time out of most of the big names in cycling on the descent which is incredible everyone except armstrong who got the gold
3728416 ones natural reaction is to back off the pedals as soon as the road starts sloping down
3728417 but like anything else it is trainable to reduce that what she would have been trying to achieve is exactly the same power uphill as down the only thing that changes is the speed
3728418 i was half asleep listening to my walkman at the front of the bus when all of a sudden the van pulled in front of the bus and there was a major collision
3728419 the bus collided with the van and in turn moved off the road and hit a guard rail
3728420 there was another australian on the bus he acted very quickly to try and do what he could to manage the situation
3728421 we were able to get one of the passengers from the back of the van out onto the road but the others were certainly very seriously injured

3728464 this tournament is all about pressure there are a lot of great players involved but in the end its all about who can focus on their cards and opponent not on the big chance of going home empty handed but i did it once so i can certainly do it again

3728475 i shouted oh my god an indian has won the olympic gold
3728476 it is not fair to keep criticizing our sportsmen when they dont win it is not fair to keep expecting results all the time
3728477 it is important to keep competing for only from experience does one learn after all it took me a long time to come good didnt it

3728489 we emphasized it last year too but this year especially
3728490 if you win the turnover battle youre going to win games and thats the bottom line
3728491 im impressed with the way weve come together and set a common goal and that common goal is to increase the turnover margin
3728492 the way im impressed is that guys are buying into it usually teams set a goal and it goes on for a couple of days and then it burns out i think all around from the corners to the safeties to the backers to the d line everybody has bought into getting turnovers
3728493 there have been spots in a couple of practices where a kid has jumped out and been really good we get a couple of interceptions a couple of fumbles then we go for a drought
3728494 those are things were building on its not nearly where i want to be yet in terms of really being a factor to change the game be a change maker in a game be a play maker and come up with that big play and of course a turnover is the biggest one you can make on defense
3728495 we realize its an important part and we were lacking in that last year
3728496 were really working hard and defensive line coach scott brown has been stressing a lot of different moves weve been getting after it one on one so i think were going to improve on that drastically
3728497 the border has been along this river for 1 000 years

3728502 if he keeps working like he is now week after week then he could end up having a pretty good season but hes had one good week
3728503 im trying to work hard every day in practice not take any reps off just trying to make sure everything is right
3728504 we think we have a pretty good handle on the situation we thought we were relatively conservative but well see how it goes
3728505 obviously this isnt something that we absolutely need to do but we stepped up to do it because we think its the right thing to do
3728506 theres a lot of anecdotal evidence like yeah my gray hair turned black again my wrinkles went away its sort of a fountain of youth concept
3728507 i dont think its ever going to be like coffee where there are six stores on a block
3728508 but i do think its going to be more popular
3728509 were not going to let any grass grow under our feet
3728510 i think as an elected officials you need to listen to citizens
3728511 they knew my track record and they knew the issues ive worked on
3728512 it will create a baseline for where the water is at in the park
3728513 we are just an ordinary family with a lot of problems
3728514 hopefully in the next month or so ill be able to put on a few pounds
3728515 being recruited they told me i was athletic enough to play guard but i never thought i would be
3728516 and then when i got here i was going back and forth between tackle and guard
3728517 there are two open spots and six guys are competing for a job shoot i mean i want to compete to play if it works out that i redshirt then thats how it works out and thats fine with me because thatll just give me an extra year
3728518 but if im one of the best guys i want to play and get it going
3728519 i was on the sidelines a lot this offseason with my arm
3728520 harder is not always smarter all the time out in practice its not always just trying to grind grind grind sometimes its just outthinking the guy thats lined up in front of you thats what is key for me this camp just trying to out think those guys in front of me
3728521 we get a chance to go out there and he has a little bit more freedom this year to check out of stuff and audible out of stuff if he sees something he likes or even if i give him the eye and were on the same page he throws it up there and lets me go get it im excited about this year and the relationship weve got building
3728522 im just anxious to get out there and compete against dallas this week and let it roll over to this weekend for the game
3728523 this is the week we see what players weve got and what were made of
3728524 theyre all studs and this is when you want to step up and make plays
3728525 we dont tackle obviously but well form up a little bit
3728526 we have a pretty smart football team on both sides and a lot of competition at the same time they are trying to protect each other its more of an evaluation process and cooler heads always prevail
3728527 when you have different competition it always gets the juices flowing thats one of the reasons why we do it
3728528 the fun of the challenge from the science perspective is that you do have farmers and biologists and entomologists and biochemists and chemical engineers and process engineers and business people and investors all working to solve this and it ranges anywhere from a political issue to a technical issue
3728529 honestly i couldnt think of a more exciting thing to work on as a scientist or technologist right now
3728530 part of the excitement comes from the fact that this is such a complex problem it cant be solved by a farmer or an ag expert and it cant be solved by a chemical engineer or a chemist
3728531 we all have to pool our various talents and training and try to come up with a whole new system of producing energy
3728532 and the current energy price environment has made literally everyone interested in replacements for petroleum
3728533 bill its al gore endorse my plan or ill strap you to a solar panel and fry you like bacon which of course ill buy a carbon offset for
3728534 there is no terror in a bang only in the anticipation of it
3728535 the length of a film should be directly related to the endurance of the human bladder
3728536 yes you made a blueberry pie and you remember the last time we had blueberry pie
3728537 yes i remember we took a picnic into cheers and jeers and thats when you said you wanted to join a nudist colony
3728538 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3728539 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3728540 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3728541 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3728542 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3728543 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3728544 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3728545 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3728546 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3728547 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3728548 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3728549 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3728550 clearly more americans chose to stay close to home in june than in previous years
3728551 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
3728552 i think people have started to take the increase in gas prices somewhat more in stride
3728553 more americans age 50 plus are trying to leave their cars behind but face obstacles as soon as they walk out the door climb on their bikes or head for the bus
3728554 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3728555 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3728556 a number of factors inimical to growth have intensified in 2008
3728557 expected losses from u s sub prime exposures have by now been mostly acknowledged it is too early to assess whether the worst of the turmoil and loss of asset values is behind us
3728558 their soba condiments dips broths and interlopers are so clearly and cleanly flavored that you feel as you use your chopsticks to drag the next tangle of soba through them or to twist it around them that your senses have been sharpened that your palate is more alert superior japanese food has that effect

3728566 it is not uncommon to see an increase in crime at this time of year
3728567 on the campus everyone is busy with the beginning of the year activities and fail to adhere to the safety rules that they usually follow
3728568 we want to remind you to take the extra time to secure items in the trunk or under the seat before leaving your automobile
3728569 the threat of a break in is reduced if your belongings are not visible remember to lock your vehicle before leaving it in the parking area

3728606 deu uma cansada n o foi aquela coisa de n o conseguir nem andar mas cansou um pouco espero melhorar esse tempo nadar em 1min58s baixo na semifinal e dentro da casa de 1min57 na final
3728607 a nica vantagem que ele tem os 200 m costas antes ele deve ficar um pouco cansado mas todo mundo vai ter que nadar muito est o todos no mesmo n vel mas n o tem jeito a maior tens o na final por conta de tudo o que pode acontecer

3728609 foi meu melhor tempo mas bvio que estou frustrado por n o ter ido final queria estar l e brigar por medalha
3728610 mas n o vou deixar isso me abater porque tenho uma batalha muito maior para enfrentar duro para mim n o ter tido chance de tentar uma medalha

3728614 the motivation in the camp is high and the guys really want to do well because this game is a great occasion
3728615 there is no question about the motivation in this side
3728616 it just comes about because of the pressure not only on the coaching staff but also on the players
3728617 the pressure is enormous and that just gets the players motivated were havent thought about revenge at all
3728618 yeah we got ourselves right back on track in auckland and now after a weeks break were in fine shape
3728619 were arrived here a day earlier and that gave us a chance to settle in nicely were pretty used to coming here to play by now
3728620 theres so much kicking in every match and thats just the way the game is going
3728621 well be looking to kick into the spaces as part of our attacking strategy
3728622 when the tactical kicking is good it just gives the team so much go forward
3728623 their the boks loose trio is very dangerous theyre all ball runners
3728624 if they get momentum they create space for other players out wide to finish off they are lethal
3728625 given the many sanctions the dos and donts at rucks and mauls you dont want to be caught too often in a breakdown in your own territory because youre liable to give a free kick away and then the momentum is with the other team
3728626 you just end up giving the ball away to the opposition
3728627 teams kick a lot more than in the past its a consequence of that law the idea is always to put the pressure on the other team

3728733 they were having some keypads issues what the judges push the other was a broadcasters decision it was not nbc the beijing broadcasters were showing the floor live as alicia was ready to compete on beam they couldnt change in the middle of a live event

3728735 it was not our decision to hold the competitor from competing
3728736 those are decisions that are made by the fig international gymnastics federation competition official the federations run the competition
3728737 they never should talk to the gymnast and they are obliged to do it right
3728738 we did so much training of making them tough and keeping their focus and concentration and still it happens it is disappointing

3728747 oh my god i dont know how hes doing it i think about how he do this and set the world record
3728748 ive still got some left in the tank he said
3728749 its the funnest thing being part of a team being there in a team environment he said
3728750 its the best thing having four american guys to all go swim well together

3728769 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way
3728770 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive

3728778 we knew exactly what we had from the start of this year
3728779 we have had our fair share of disappointments over the last few years but we are still hungry for it and we still go to every event thinking we can win or certainly be on the podium
3728780 we have never lost confidence in ourselves or the team everybody is working very very hard i think when the first victory comes in the new car it will be a very very sweet one
3728781 the main thing now is that we get this new car sorted out by the end of the season then we can start 2009 with a proper attack on the championship that is the priority at the moment

3728881 es ist uns erstmalig gelungen wichtige materialeigenschaften dieses sensors im nanobereich zu messen um damit unser modell der wirkungsweise weiter zu best tigen
3728882 insgesamt gibt es im insektenreich nur vier solcher bekannten infrarotsensoren zwei davon in australischen k fern die allerdings nach v llig anderen prinzipien arbeiten und eines bei einer wanze deren wirkweise hnlich dem des prachtk fers ist
3728883 die zahl ist nicht wissenschaftlich belegt fest steht allerdings dass der sensor so empfindlich ist dass der k fer den brand aus mehreren kilometern entfernung detektieren kann
3728884 es ist uns aber gelungen der wirkweise dieses sensors der etwa f nfmal schneller als technische infrarot f hler arbeitet n her zu kommen

3728887 das faszinierende an diesem mechanismus ist dass der k fer diese spannungs nderungen schon wenige tausendstel sekunden nach dem infrarot puls registriert

3728955 point no 2 is access for the provisions of humanitarian relief point no 3 is the commitment not to use forces and to refrain from inflammatory rhetoric point no 4 is the withdrawal of all armed personnel to positions prevailing before the start of the current hostilities
3728956 there are details that need to be clarified specifically with regard to the role of the international community in seeking to resolve the conflict
3728957 if there are little pockets of opposition and other aggressive manifestations we will make a decision to liquidate them
3728958 although there should be a temporary arrangement for now later it should be replaced by an international process with the participation of the eu and the un
3728959 what we have clearly obtained at this stage is a cessation of hostilities and the withdrawal of the occupying forces we have a temporary arrangement with the russian peacekeepers fine but then there should be internationalization of the process and we have the commitment of all sides
3728960 of course this is a political document but general principles are there we need legal details we need a security council resolution and we need more international observers on the ground and more internationalization of the entire process
3728961 and while sovereignty is based on the will of the people and the constitution territorial integrity as a rule represents the real state of affairs
3728962 can the ossetians and the abkhaz and do they want to be a part of georgia
3728963 this question should be put to them and they will give their own unambiguous answer it is not russia or any other country that should answer this question this should be done in strict compliance with international law although in recent years international law too has abounded with examples of self determination of peoples and the emergence of new states on the map lets recall the example of kosovo so it is a question that needs to be answered by the ossetians and the abkhaz taking into consideration history and what has happened in recent days
3728964 the question of the future status of abkhazia and south ossetia reflects a clear understanding that the status quo is untenable
3728965 the irc provides life saving humanitarian assistance to those most affected by the conflict and it is reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted
3728966 we face a growing humanitarian challenge in afghanistan and all parties to this conflict must recognize and respect the inherent neutrality and independence of the humanitarian assistance being provided to those afghans who need our help the most
3728967 the audiences are wonderful at every performance we see couples on dates groups dressed up for a night out and of course parents bringing their kids to the theater for the first time everyone is so taken by the production that people are lining up at intermission to buy tickets for their friends and family or to see the show themselves for a second or third time what better way to celebrate summer in miami than with two more weeks of snow snow snow
3728968 slava and the rest of the company have fallen in love with miami

3728973 so i called what i thought was his place of employment and sharon says he doesnt work here and i said he doesnt she says no i fired him in december
3728974 i dont know if he has the ability to tell the truth

3728976 hey you hold on just a minute roger that enterprise 6 7 message confirmed be prepared for that secondary is on its way to you as i speak anyway just calling you

3728980 for south floridas sluggish housing market one word became shorthand for the magic elixir to get buyers and sellers on the move again portability gov charlie crist predicted it would spark a sonic boom in home buying but the states home turnover rate of 3 percent is the lowest in years state economists said in a newly released report
3728981 analysts say any portability fueled boost in home sales was swamped by stronger forces pulling down the real estate market in florida and nationwide crumbling home prices tightening credit standards and a wave of foreclosures
3728982 unfortunately the credit crunch hit at the same time as portability said john mike president of the realtors association of the palm beaches
3728983 the foreclosure rates in broward and miami dade counties increased dramatically between 2006 and 2007 in miami dade county 9 814 homes were foreclosed in 2006 and 26 931 were foreclosed in 2007 the foreclosure rate in broward county went from 516 homes in 2006 to 3 616 in 2007
3728984 deerfield beach resident dino lapena said the property next door to his has not been cared for since its foreclosure and he is worried about his own property
3728985 this is a nice neighborhood but now therere so many homes for sale lapena said
3728986 my recent column about the war of words between the presidents of the states banking and mortgage broker trade associations brought this reaction from bradenton appraiser jeff deuitch owner of manatee appraisal service
3728987 i do have to agree with the bankers that a higher proportion of mortgage brokers are unscrupulous than bankers deuitch wrote in an e mail
3728988 in my experience a phone call from a mortgage broker requesting an appraisal for a residential property would nearly always include language about us guaranteeing that a property would achieve some kind of minimum value prior to granting the appraisal assignment said deuitch
3728989 during the 2003 05 period i was fielding one to two calls per day of this type
3728990 it is not to say that this did not occur with banks
3728991 according to figures released june 25 by the u s department of housing and urban development and the u s census bureau 512 000 new single family homes were sold in may of this year that number is 40 3 percent below the number of homes sold in may 2007
3728992 the data confirmed what has been known by developers who arent developing and real estate agents who arent listing because nobodys buying so nobodys selling
3728993 the effects of the real estate slump are also being felt by attorneys who practice in the area of real estate law compared to a year ago my real estate practice is only a third of what it was said bryan goode of dirito goode dempsey at jacksonville beach
3728994 obviously closings are down but our firm is diversified so were focusing on other areas like wills trusts probate and commercial litigation were continuing to pursue real estate but weve got to watch our overhead
3728995 crabtree amp fallars randy crabtree has also watched his practice change with the real estate market
3728996 crabtree also has no idea as to when the market will turn around but did predict it could be an astronomical collapse if something isnt done to get things going again
3728997 but even if you could get land at zero cost you cant build right now for a price anyone can afford and even if interest rates were at 0 percent nobody would make any money so the system wouldnt work its like a tornado everything we knew about real estate is no longer true crabtree said
3728998 i count him braver who overcomes his desires than him who conquers his enemies for the hardest victory is over self

3729007 michgos argument fails to come to grips with the fact that michgo has lost on the merits of its claims at every step of this litigation
3729008 it lost in the district court it lost in the court of appeals and it lost again in the court of appeals when it sought rehearing en banc
3729009 michgo cannot carry its burden of establishing irreparable harm and further delaying interiors lawfully rendered decision on the slender reed of what michgo may or may not be able to raise in an almost surely futile certiorari petition

3729023 wilson and house were willing to bargain territories and populations for the particular peace they wanted
3729024 while the president dreamed of saving the world house was beginning to contemplate the implications for the american state of being a world power in this activity between 1915 and 1917 it is not fanciful to see a first sketchy draft of what would become the national security state
3729025 in spite of all he was doing a break with germany could not be averted but only deferred
3729026 no official role in the campaign yet he planned its structure set its tone guided its finance chose speakers tactics and strategy and not least handled the campaigns greatest asset and greatest potential liability its brilliant but temperamental candidate

3729031 their friendship never recovered from the events of february and march 1919 it ended in bitterness and mutual incomprehension with grave consequences for both of them and ultimately it really is no exaggeration to say for the peace of the world
3729032 wilsons entourage consisting of his wife edith his personal physician admiral cary t grayson his press secretary ray stannard baker and the kingmaker bernard baruch then and for the rest of their lives interpreted houses entirely intelligible and honorable diplomatic maneuvers as the blackest treason

3729038 current market focus remains on the u s dollar which recently broke above a downtrend line that was first established six years ago
3729039 the vicious sell off has resulted in gold now being massively oversold
3729040 while bottom calling is a dangerous pursuit and the old market adage to never catch a falling knife remains appropriate value investors and bargain hunters with longer term horizons are likely to be strong buyers at these very depressed levels
3729041 overall fears over weakening demand are still dominating the market so todays report from the eia could indicate a near term direction for crude futures
3729042 we believe this reduction in cancellations is a positive sign
3729043 given the current state of the market we are not comfortable giving earnings guidance said chief financial officer joel rassman
3729044 congress and the white house have offered a lifeline to many homeowners facing foreclosure which should help keep more people in their homes and fewer distressed properties from coming on the market
3729045 foreclosures have become the dominant force in the resale market leading to a surge in transactions plummeting prices and mounting hidden inventory
3729046 many have interpreted this as signs of a bottom a view we think is incorrect distressed inventory is substantial hidden and is likely to keep rising

3729059 how many americans would vote for a presidential candidate who was the member of a church that professed the following credo

3729070 while this investigation is taking so long people are losing the trust that they had in the county government and it is a very big heavy cloud not only on the correctional officers but on the county
3729071 the longer it takes people will begin to suspect that the county government is trying to do a coverup and that is not what we want to happen
3729072 were awaiting the results of the investigation like everyone else
3729073 i think its unfair for ms dillard to criticize and to indicate that the county government is involved in any coverup nothing could be further from the truth
3729074 the white family is very disappointed in the progress of the investigation at this point
3729075 we want there to be a thorough and detailed investigation but we believe it could be done in a much more expeditious manner it has become painfully obvious that this investigation and the prosecution of these wrongdoers are well beyond those charged with those responsibilities at this time

3729077 it may be once in a century we see something like this the rest of the world is catching up to the u s the way i look at it quite a bit for him to be doing what hes doing at this moment in time with the rest of the world coming up the way it is i think that speaks volumes and the way hes attacking this meet too hes not just winning hes absolutely destroying every race its awesome to watch its inspiring to me
3729078 theres nobody in any sport that can win like he wins hes not just winning hes crunching world records and crunching the fields its amazing
3729079 i figured out michael phelps hes not from another planet hes from the future
3729080 poor laszlo cseh the hungarian who twice in these games has finished second to michael phelps was quite frank when asked by a reporter whether he had thought during wednesdays 200m butterfly that he could actually beat michael phelps
3729081 phelps is so fast he can win with his eyes closed
3729082 word reaches me out here that some people back home think that michael phelps is
3729083 michael phelps is hot hot hot hot hot ddd haha and hes like the worlds fastest swimmer hes already won like 5 gold medals isnt that amazing another 3 and hell have reached his goal he keeps smashing records and making new ones like ohmygosh its a good thing that everyday during recess the tvs in the canteen show him swimming is it pure coincidence or is it due to the fact that maybe michael phelps knows that he has umpteen fans in school and so he demanded that his match be shown at such and such a time okay that was so lame but really there are avid michael phelps fans in school everytime he wins a race the whole and i repeat whole canteen breaks out in a loud cheer like whoo michael phelps has won now even my mum likes him haha

3729091 you2gov com brings power to the people in the new media era
3729092 every day thousands of decisions are made by political bodies around the country from city councils to the 50 state legislatures to the united states congress while citizens sit on the sidelines because they arent sure what is happening when or where or who will listen to their opinions before the decisions and laws are final most americans dont have the money to hire lobbyists to get inside information and access to their elected officials with you2gov com regular americans now have their own access to power and its free the information on the issues the research the form letters and contact information for elected officials is all there all you2gov users have to do is log on share their ideas and concerns connect with like minded citizens and take action either individually or collectively its that simple
3729093 we are very excited about the reaction weve received here in new orleans everyone from elected officials to educators and non profits executives have expressed that a website this comprehensive and powerful will better educate citizens and help them to become more civically active and effective that is our mission and we believe american citizens are going to be just as enthusiastic about all that you2gov has to offer
3729094 when companies and economies are under pressure people look for ways to become more productive
3729095 i think the overall industry growth will be pretty healthy i feel it is possible that dell will grow faster than the industry
3729096 our objective is to be as comprehensive a community as possible for people affected by arthritis and related diseases
3729097 we wanted to improve the user experience on our web site by adding tools that enable people to contribute in a meaningful way while also facilitating networking between users theport is a valued partner in helping us to achieve our goals
3729098 nonprofits are recognizing social networking as a way to unite supporters online and encourage advocacy for their causes we are pleased the arthritis foundation is using our social media platform to extend key new capabilities to site members
3729099 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3729100 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3729101 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3729102 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3729103 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3729104 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3729105 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3729106 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3729107 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3729108 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3729109 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3729110 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3729111 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3729112 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3729113 the new 14 492 square meter facility will be gms first diesel engine plant in southeast asia
3729114 we think our troops are being well served if they have the misfortune of being wounded in terms of evacuation and immediate medical care
3729115 were unhappy with what happens when you come home and thats a much larger problem
3729116 it has to do with the uneven nature of medicare in canada and how some provinces seem to excel at it and other provinces dont provide the same quality of it
3729117 but its fundamentally unfair to push the wounded soldiers and already over stressed families onto an already overburdened civilian health care system
3729118 there has to be some sort of inclusion for the long term care costs of rehabilitation and psychological care for the soldiers when theyre in uniform and when they come out of uniform
3729119 the federal government should ensure there are regional centers at a minimum that would provide for the care and the rehabilitiation
3729120 developing centres of excellence on cf bases affiliated with nearby civilian providers
3729121 i know we wanted to have something hanging around our necks
3729122 were still climbing a mountain you cant just start at the bottom and magically appear on the top were going to keep climbing were always there but its a tough climb
3729123 we have to put our swimmers against the best in the world more and more often
3729124 we have to go around the world with our best group and go against the europeans the americans the australians
3729125 youre talking about budget youre talking about time away from school i think we have to do that were still knocking on the door
3729126 we were in a position to race for that medal
3729127 unfortunately there were a couple of teams that executed a little bit better than we did
3729128 it seemed like lit was going to be easy but we could see nothing is ever really easy
3729129 sometimes you try too hard because you want it so bad we cant be chasing medals weve got to keep fighting when you try too hard you tighten up and you dont get what you want
3729130 it just came down to i didnt go fast enough
3729131 brent came on those guys in the third leg like a freight train he gave me a big boost unfortunately i came up a little bit shy
3729132 it would have been really hard to justify any other way

3729135 however continued uncertainty amongst potential buyers and difficulties that first time buyers are experiencing obtaining mortgage finance have resulted in the housing market being at a virtual standstill in many areas
3729136 indeed some agents are already reporting an increase in inquiry levels in some areas as many seek bargains
3729137 there is uncertainty amongst homebuyers and those remortgaging and it is therefore more important than ever that they avail of the best mortgage advice available
3729138 consumers should ensure that they fully investigate their options in order to avail of the most suitable products to meet their individual needs
3729139 the people must get the councils permission before tagging walls and we have put at place a mechanism which protects mural artist as opposed to graffiti vandals so that a big distinction can be made between graffiti and murals
3729140 at the same time we roll out this hand in hand with a policy that allows us to clean up graffiti and we are already funding some clean up in different areas
3729141 im writing every day right here at the piano in this living room this is my best work ever
3729142 if this hadnt happened i would never have been able to get back with my daughter and have this relationship i have with these two little boys
3729143 im writing every day right here at the piano in this living room this is my best work ever
3729144 nope that honor belongs to normal ohio but rules definitely cracks the top 50
3729145 theres a period where hes lighter in the show but that follows a period of him being very present in the show
3729146 its more of a situation where you need some characters to drop back so you can bring other characters forward youll see that holly is very present for a number of episodes and then for a couple she is much lighter thats the ebb and flow of having a big ensemble drama
3729147 im not sure if im going to be in every episode this year but im going to be a regular
3729148 i had always been interested in doing another sitcom i love the energy from the audience its just a perfect situation
3729149 its wonderful the relationship is new for both of us she sometimes calls me 50 times a day and asks me things that light my life up but like all daughters she is very manipulative and cunning so she gets what she wants a lot
3729150 they are so huge i thought they may make someone a nice shawl or even better something for
3729151 empty condom packet amp a photo of the tarts knickers
3729152 the next item that will probably be sold on ebay at a start price of 99c and of course with no reserve
3729153 we let her know about the policy and instead shes now selling a photograph of the offending knickers
3729154 this is obviously very therapeutic for this woman and it must be a great channel for her views on cheating and the sanctity of marriage
3729155 i got a call that if i want the tickets i have to volunteer two shifts of three hours apiece for one ticket if i want two tickets then its four shifts of two hours apiece
3729156 i received a call monday saying i could qualify for the tickets if i do 12 hours of volunteer work for the obama campaign between now and friday the 15th
3729157 to work 40 hours at my job get to and from work get to and from the campaign office and complete the 12 hours in three days would be next to impossible
3729158 my whole reason why im so mad about it is because democrats need to act like democrats
3729159 democrats work for a living and they have to work and take care of their families and they say these are open to those in the community so they shouldnt ask people to drop everything in their lives for this
3729160 you mean we cant get something for free well obama loses my vote then
3729161 my whole reason why im so mad about it is because democrats need to act like democrats
3729162 democrats work for a living and they have to work and take care of their families
3729163 you three just volunteered to move out and draw fire
3729164 we support the governments efforts to market kenya and malindi in particular the recent visit by the minister for tourism mr najib balala to italy created awareness to italian visitors we will put all our power to market malindi
3729165 we could not make it without live fire i instructed the officers that they can use the firearms as authorised by the law regarding the quelling of riots
3729166 we had an operation order that was mainly precautionary to guard vital installations in our areas of jurisdictions in anticipation of any eventuality
3729167 you bastard you are going back to uganda you are just faking it pretending
3729168 one of the most shocking reports about our uk immigration system that i have seen in 20 years as a member of parliament
3729169 the report catalogues the frightening state sponsored violence that happens to asylum seekers when they are being deported this report suggests a complete failure by the home office to investigate many of the allegations
3729170 this report is distressing and upsetting for anyone to read but for uk ministers it is a damning verdict on their inability to inject even a shred of humanity into a flailing immigration system
3729171 together with every right thinking person those who read it will not want to believe what it contains if the home office ministers and officials alike is sensible it will pay due attention to the dossier they should recognise that our national reputation is not something to be treated lightly or wantonly and that if even one of the cases is substantiated that amounts to something of a preventable national disgrace
3729172 i have seen many serious injuries with long lasting effects crushing of nerves at the wrist from forceful pulling on handcuffs limitation of neck movement by patients whose heads were pushed under aircraft seats numbness of the face after blows around the cheek and eye
3729173 i have seen far worse abuses but do not have the patients permission to reveal confidential medical information our report includes evidence from 18 independent doctors some of these findings are worse still they include dislocation to the knee requiring a plaster cast and several people rendered unable to walk for extended periods some were denied wheelchairs pain relief and other essential treatment although in state custody
3729174 reveals the extent of lawless disregard for basic rules in the application of force combined with a wholly inadequate system for investigating often extremely serious criminal allegations
3729175 been shocked to discover the extent of casual racism and inhumanity from officers employed by the home office and its subcontracted private companies
3729176 the home office uses charter flights and military planes to deport to places like afghanistan and iraq and even arranged a private jet to deport one suicidal 14 year old girl and her mother
3729177 pas should support anwar even though we are hardly similar in political ideology
3729178 whenever pas has been in a coalition with other parties it has fared well in elections
3729179 so pas needs anwar if it wants to do well outside of the malay heartland and that the party members cannot deny
3729180 the opposition offers more possibilities because it is very new if they win there could be opportunities for pas like getting ministerial posts for islamic affairs
3729181 political risk has become a major problem in malaysia and has the potential to destabilise the nation

3729184 it would not be right to offer the prospect of self handling or self selection of a quayside handling contractor to a t2 terminal two operator whilst denying the same opportunity to those remaining in t1 terminal one
3729185 the proposed changes will result in the transfer of approximately 190 staff directly employed by dover harbour board which represents about one third of the full time workforce
3729186 as a former officer on dovers cross channel ferries im very much aware of the important role played by the berthing gangs the tug drivers and the security officers
3729187 the hiving off of these services to private operators will impact negatively on employees conditions of service and on safety
3729188 the local union reps and the work force has worked tirelessly to co operate with dover harbour board and it beggars belief that that they should be rewarded with this unilateral board decision to terminate their employment
3729189 the dover harbour boards action is a betrayal of their loyal workforce

3729205 the poincar e dodecahedral space is a dodecahedral block of space with opposite faces abstractly glued together so objects passing out of the dodecahedron across any face return from the opposite face light travels across the faces in the same way so if we sit inside the dodecahedron and look outward across a face our line of sight re enters the dodecahedron from the opposite face we have the illusion of looking into an adjacent copy of the dodecahedron if we take the original dodecahedral block of space not as a euclidean dodecahedron with edge angles 117 but as a spherical dodecahedron with edge angles exactly 120 then adjacent images of the dodecahedron fit together snugly to tile the hypersphere analogously to the way adjacent images of spherical pentagons with perfect 120 angles fit snugly to tile an ordinary sphere thus the poincar e space is a positively curved space with a multiply connected topology whose volume is 120 times smaller than that of the simply connected hypersphere
3729206 our first project seeks to discourage groups and right wing donors trying to swiftboat progressives
3729207 most of the time spears didnt even try to hide the fact that she was faking it smacking her gum like a cow chewing its cud instead of mouthing words
3729208 weve been saying youre missing a great opportunity to get more of your people in here to celebrate your games
3729209 i would want to stress how important it is for the host city that the venues are seen to be full and everybody has the opportunity to enjoy the festivities
3729210 we have taken this up with organizers and the politicians
3729211 they have promised an improvement yesterday and further improvement today we hope this is going to take place we need more people to have a higher atmosphere
3729212 when i went out there was a small trickle of people walking through
3729213 access is difficult and security is incredibly tight at some venues its surprising when there have been sellouts and you see quite a few empty seats at the stadiums you need warm enthusiastic crowds to help create an atmosphere for athletes to perform at their best
3729214 i just went to volleyball and it was absolutely rocking
3729215 if they find that there are not enough people or if they find too many empty seats they will organize some cheerleaders who are volunteers
3729216 we have been implementing strict measures to prevent the scalping of tickets
3729217 had the donor community been hard on the government right from the third phase regime grand corruption could have been avoided
3729218 the donor community has always remained silent on the governments bad practices worse still the same donors have been praising the government saying the administration of this country has been observing good governance while things in fact are falling apart
3729219 we would be comfortable if mr githongo was given the top most position in pccb because we all know that he boldly fought corruption in kenya
3729220 we are doing well even donors recognise our efforts in fighting corruption i dont know why they are complaining we are working tirelessly to deal with all graft cases

3729226 the dod the nations biggest polluter is now cleaning up 29 500 currently or formerly contaminated sites in every state and territory california alone has 3 912 contaminated sites on 441 current and former dod installations many of dods facilities have already contaminated groundwater sources of drinking water the cost to clean up toxic munitions contamination and unexploded ordnance at active and former military installations around the country may reach 200 billion
3729227 the defense department is refusing to comply with orders or sign contracts to clean up 11 hazardous waste sites including one in hawaii and has asked the white house and justice department to intervene on its behalf
3729228 large numbers of corroding depleted uranium penetrators embedded in the ground might pose a long term threat if the uranium leaches into water supplies
3729229 long term environmental sampling particularly of water and milk is required and provides a cost effective method of monitoring sensitive components of the environment and of providing information about uranium levels to concerned local populations monitoring may need to be enhanced in some areas by site specific risk assessment if the situation warrants further consideration
3729230 offer strong evidence of the correlation between low level radiation exposure and result ing health damages
3729231 a shift of leukemia incidence rates towards younger children during the recent years
3729232 in aggregate the human epidemiological evidence is consistent with increased risk of birth defects in offspring of persons exposed to du
3729233 the chemical risks of breathing in uranium dust are so low that it wont cause any long term health risks
3729234 radioactive material and waste will not be locally disposed of through burial submersion incineration destruction in place or abandonment without approval from overall commander
3729235 if local disposal is approved the responsible commander must document the general nature of the disposed material and the exact location of the disposal
3729236 the fire and explosions damaged or destroyed 102 vehicles including four m1a1 tanks and numerous other combat vehicles more than two dozen buildings sustained damage as well among the estimated almost 15 million in damaged or destroyed ammunition were 660 m829 120mm du sabot rounds
3729237 personnel packing the drums with du penetrators wore surgeons caps safety glasses half face protective masks coveralls butyl rubber aprons rubber surgeons gloves with cotton inserts and rubber booties over their normal work boots a total of eight drums were filled with about 250 du penetrators
3729238 under the circumstances the army had no legal obligation to clean up the particulate material
3729239 the soil is not regulated as radioactive material by the us department of transportation
3729240 the army is responsible for characterizing the material for the purposes of complying with transportation and disposal requirements the epa does not have a specific standard related to depleted uranium for the purposes of disposal depleted uranium is considered a low level radioactive waste and is subject to u s nuclear regulatory commission regulations
3729241 the sand with small amounts of depleted uranium being sent to the u s ecology idaho facility for disposal contains exempt concentrations of uranium less than 0 5 percent weight if the concentrations were greater than this we would have oversight
3729242 during my entire tour one could say that i was in the loop in the know about operations
3729243 my notes from all of the meetings we had and we had meetings twice a day every day and many times having a meeting or two in between i can still not find one mention of potential health hazards from depleted uranium or the possible contamination of any area at camp doha
3729244 i have what they call ibs irritable bowel syndrome but theyve not been able to treat it with any success it creates constant bad bad cramping in the lower abdomen severe fatigue bad joint pain all of the norms rolled up into the gulf war illness tag
3729245 as for what i believe is the cause of my declining health
3729246 there were three constants when i arrived a doha there were the burning oil well fires there was a constant presence of insects pesticides and then there was the du ive always believed that there is more to the du than the us government and dod would like us to believe
3729247 young childrens exposure to depleted uranium must be monitored and preventive measures taken and heavily affected impact zones for depleted uranium munitions should be cordoned off and cleaned up
3729248 ever since its use by the allied forces in the first war against iraq there have been serious concerns about the radiological and chemical toxicity of the fine uranium particles produced when such weapons impact on hard targets concerns have also been expressed about the contamination of soil and groundwater by expended rounds that have missed their targets and their implications for civilian populations despite the fact that scientific research has so far been unable to find conclusive evidence of harm there are numerous testimonies as to the harmful and often deadly effects on both military personnel and civilians the last few years have seen great advances in terms of understanding the environmental and health hazards posed by depleted uranium and whereas it is high time that this was reflected in international military standards as they develop the use of depleted uranium in warfare runs counter to the basic rules and principles enshrined in written and customary international humanitarian and environmental law
3729249 there is no reliable scientific or medical evidence to link du with the ill health of either gulf or balkans veterans or people living in these regions many independent reports have been produced and researchers continue to consider the battlefield effects of using du munitions these reports include work by the royal society the european commission the united nations environment programme unep and the world health organization who none of these organizations has found a connection between du exposure and illness and none has found widespread du contamination sufficient to impact the health of the general population or deployed personnel
3729250 to undertake every measure possible to ensure that depleted uranium weapons of mass destruction are banned forever
3729251 belgium has banned the use of uranium in all conventional weapon systems however at least 18 countries including the u s use depleted uranium in their arsenals they are considered weapons of mass destruction under international law according to a canada u s agreement canadian uranium exports may only be used for peaceful purposes
3729252 because natural uranium in the general environment is mostly in large particles created from natural weathering processes the body seems to be able to eject these but weapons uranium dust is formed at very high temperature into ultra fine particles described as aerosols that can pass through cell walls etc in the lungs these will go into soft tissue and stay there rather than being coughed out
3729253 have accumulated many types of waste and contamination over the years the federal government estimated its environmental liability to clean up this waste at 249 billion in fiscal year 2004
3729254 i tell you with full responsibility that there are no russian tanks in gori today and there is no reason to be
3729255 georgia has been sticking to its commitments but i dont think there is much to stick to here
3729256 the georgian side must immediately fulfill this key issue to remove all dangers concerning relapses
3729257 prevent any aggressive ambitions on the part of the georgian leadership
3729258 let the world finally wake up and take the action and provide the real security for the region
3729259 this is the first time that weve actually seen an invasion a unilateral invasion of a country

3729262 for years fema resisted acknowledging the problem or seeking funds for remediation
3729263 we are committed to upholding our obligations to remediate remove or upgrade them as necessary
3729264 we believe in adhering to any relevant environmental rule or law and will do so
3729265 they dont even know who the georgian president is how can you call them georgians they are brazilians and that is who we played against today
3729266 we were not very good players in brazil but we grow as we play for georgia

3729280 it has to do with the uneven nature of medicare in canada and how some provinces seem to excel at it and other provinces dont provide the same quality of it
3729281 but its fundamentally unfair to push the wounded soldiers and already over stressed families onto an already overburdened civilian health care system
3729282 there has to be some sort of inclusion for the long term care costs of rehabilitation and psychological care for the soldiers when theyre in uniform and when they come out of uniform
3729283 the federal government should ensure there are regional centers at a minimum that would provide for the care and the rehabilitiation

3729329 i want to thank you for knowing i am a john wayne fan
3729330 i dont know if any of you saw it but they had a front page and they had me as john wayne
3729331 i took it as a compliment now maybe i just have a propensity to always see the glass as half full but why wouldnt you want to be compared to john wayne
3729332 and i dont care how they try to pitch that im taking it as a compliment
3729333 and in addition to that my wife saw that picture and she just loved it and she asked me to ask him for exactly that so i want to thank you for anticipating

3729352 its a huge issue for artists because of their high rate of self employment plus their low income which makes health insurance really really difficult to afford
3729353 there used to be the popular perception that uninsured people werent hard working and employed people
3729354 even though populations of color and immigrants are disproportionately likely to be uninsured most of the uninsured 88 5 percent in minnesota are people who were born here in the u s and 78 2 percent are white
3729355 the middle class is having a lot of difficulty affording health care coverage and its getting harder for employers to offer it
3729356 weve seen a drop in the number of people in the state and u s who are covered by employer based health coverage we know people are getting squeezed its more and more expensive its not just a low income issue anymore but people with low incomes are suffering more particularly minorities and young adults just coming out of school who havent gotten into positions that offer health care
3729357 but we do know that for the 20 percent of uninsured who have access to employer based insurance the overwhelming reason they dont take it is because of the cost
3729358 a number of people in the policy arena and the public have the vision of young people as being young invincibles who are making a foolish choice
3729359 younger people will say to me gee i hardly ever go to the doctor im young and healthy i dont need health insurance
3729360 for young adults its more often a lack of access to employer coverage than not signing up for it when its available
3729361 they are just as likely as older workers to sign up when they have access to it but theyre much less likely to have access to that coverage it could be because of the kinds of jobs they have
3729362 weve found that with the public programs theres either a lack of awareness about their eligibility and the programs or a lack of willingness to enroll in whats perceived as public assistance
3729363 theyre making enough that they dont qualify for public programs but they still cant afford whats on the private market
3729364 there are a lot of great resources and low cost clinics but its a really complicated system to navigate
3729365 its a band aid to help artists with their immediate needs so they can get care to prevent major health disasters
3729366 the five of us who work here arent going to be able to address everything so thats why weve chosen to focus on health care how artists can get help today to go to the doctor today and not when it gets to the emergency stage
3729367 this wasnt an ongoing program but its a good example of how finding these resources is a moving target

3729369 religions do make claims about the universe the same kinds of claims that scientists make except theyre usually false

3729376 i joined the unit more or less agnostic on drugs policy being personally opposed to drug use but open minded about the best way to deal with the problem i was certainly not inclined to decriminalise
3729377 no significant lasting impact on the availability affordability or use of drugs
3729378 the argument always put forward against this is that there would be a commensurate increase in drug use as a result of legalisation
3729379 this it seems to me is a bogus point tobacco is a legal drug whose use is declining and precisely because it is legal its users are far more amenable to government control education programmes and taxation than they would be were it illegal
3729380 the idea that many people are holding back solely because of a law which they know is already unenforceable is simply ridiculous
3729381 it is illegal to weigh or advertise a product by only using imperial measurement if you want to report a shop trader for doing this you should contact your local trading standards department address below which is responsible for enforcing the weights and measures act

3729386 the emission reduction goal is achievable if action starts today
3729387 there is a misconception that it is not possible to make these changes because it isnt affordable
3729388 in fact these methods can be used and save people a lot of money and fuel energy efficiency can help consumers and benefits the economy especially with high gas prices
3729389 one thing that surprised me is how far behind our fuel efficiency standards are compared to the rest of the world that is europe australia and china chinas standards today are more stringent than proposed u s standards for 2020
3729390 the technology to make this happen exists it is just a matter of using it
3729391 the engines we use in our cars are no worse or better than the engines they have in passenger cars in japan or germany the difference is we put our engines in enormous cars
3729392 if we clean up the electricity sector we can get a significant benefit from switching to plug in hybrids
3729393 one thing that surprised me is how far behind our fuel efficiency standards are compared to the rest of the world that is europe australia and china chinas standards today are more stringent than proposed u s standards for 2020 this is an american competitiveness issue this situation makes our economy less efficient
3729394 even though 50 is rated only as important it is categorized as information theft
3729395 an attacker can steal the users messenger id and they can use it to call people for audio and video conferences and to see all the users chat information
3729396 all four can provide a hacker with remote code execution across ie 6 and 7 and across almost all versions of windows every single web page in the world has some level of html and so we think this is one people need to get ahead of this is going to be a playground for hackers

3729456 the general assembly should reduce or eliminate funding for a secondary roads program
3729457 long standing statutory formulas and have not generally been the subject of discussion or change in the legislative appropriations process
3729458 the department of transportation has completed most of the secondary road construction program called for in the highway trust fund legislation of 1989
3729459 miles paved and homes served have generally been declining as the highest priority roads have in most cases been built
3729460 the current approach divides the funds among counties but is not consistent with a statewide strategic plan that paves or maintains roads based on state priorities
3729461 the htf program should be further adjusted to eliminate the requirement to pave all unpaved secondary roads with total traffic volume of between 50 and 100 cars per day
3729462 the general assembly should reduce or eliminate funding for a secondary roads program

3729467 this is china turning on its hospitality and welcoming people and it isnt just journalists getting the red carpet treatment
3729468 on the substantive issues there hasnt been much movement at all
3729469 the one human rights pledge that china made was that there would be a free media for the games and that just hasnt materialized
3729470 i can give you a general principle that is the chinese government adopts a positive and open attitude and welcomes foreign journalists coming to china and report on the beijing olympics
3729471 sonam and kunal came hand in hand for an early evening show they got the corner seat in the last row a group of youngsters recognised them and began to create a ruckus some girls ran to their seat to take an autograph and pictures but the duo refused to let them take pictures kunal was sporting enough to sign some autographs but sonam refused to interact with the young admirers
3729472 once the movie started they had a small argument because sonam was not happy that kunal was interacting with his fans she wanted him to maintain a low profile but they soon made up and kunal had his arm around sonams shoulders for the rest of the film in the interval the kapoor girl stayed put while he went out to fetch cold drinks and popcorn they made a quiet exit seconds before the end credits rolled out

3729489 putin and medvedev have called the wests bluff we are sort of stuck in a time warp of the 1990s seemingly eons ago in which a once earnest weak post soviet russia sought western economic help and political mentoring but those days are long gone and diplomacy hasnt caught up with the new realities russia is flush with billions it serves as a rallying point and arms supplier to thugs the world over that want leverage in their anti western agendas for the last five years its foreign policy can be reduced to whatever the united states is for we are against the geopolitical message is clear to both the west and the former soviet republics dont consider nato membership
3729490 russias aggression is really about the subordination of georgia a democratic market oriented u s ally this is the recrudescence of russias dominance in what it calls the near abroad ukraine another nation guilty of being provocatively democratic near russia should tremble because there is not much america can do it is a bystander at the bullying of an ally that might be about to undergo regime change
3729491 observers of biblical prophecies such as ezekiel 38 and 39 will note that directly or effectively controlling georgia would be key when moscow one day begins moving russian military forces through turkey and into lebanon syria and eventually against israel
3729492 this is what i wrote in gods unfolding battle plan one such nation that will align with others to come against israel is russia
3729493 as a result of russias newfound aggression the united states and other nations will begin to distance themselves from russia in fact 2008 will be the defining year for russia for a season a new favor will arise and rest upon russia so that new alignments can be formed
3729494 the nations listed in ezekiel will begin to align with this power from the north that is seeking a renewed role in world influence
3729495 the above quotes from gods unfolding battle plan are very important to read because of the impact that the events beginning in that region will have on the realignment of the nations worldwide
3729496 here are some things to ponder russia will continue to be the pursuing dominant force that attempts to rule the caucasus
3729497 what you must notice is the new boldness and confidence that russia is now poised to demonstrate to the world
3729498 you also must be aware of their indifference to general worldwide opinion

3729524 thats easily to be understood from his comments and i just beg to differ with that because the fact of the matter is all the stuff that i saw reported were reports on things the president said from his own mouth
3729525 most people thought that the most telling thing back in january was the equation that the president made of jesse jackson having won south carolina caucuses 20 years earlier and compared that with obama winning the south carolina primary theres a big difference in a caucus and a primary
3729526 irrespective of what the president may have meant by the statement a lot of people interpreted that as having a racial connotation and jim clyburn didnt speak on that issue at all
3729527 i dont know that ive done any surveys to determine whether or not the president former president has ever damaged himself or not

3729764 coming so soon after his brilliant win in the british open this was a fantastic achievement by padraig it makes him the first european golfer to win back to back majors the whole country is immensely proud of him
3729765 to win two british opens back toback is quite an achievement but to win two majors back to back is absolutely incredible to become the first irishman to win a major in the us ensures his place in sporting history and legend
3729766 yet again padraigs performance on the back nine of a major epitomised everything about the man skill courage determination and sheer class
3729767 it gives us a chance for a bit of retribution or whatever you want to call it
3729768 back in 2005 tyrone were probably a level above us but it was the first time we really competed against a team of that calibre one of the top two or three in ireland so we would have learned a lot from it
3729769 they were the benchmark then they went on to win the all ireland that year we probably should have beaten them the first day and maybe the second day we fell behind and produced a bit of a comeback but they were probably that bit stronger

3729778 personally i think ricky has proved himself as south africas leading scrumhalf is it fouries world cup status that now elevates him above ricky

3729781 i know peter wants to win the tri nations but he must realise he will be measured according to his ability to transform the team and to make it representative of the countrys population for the 2011 world cup
3729782 we have also seen nothing of the new type of rugby that peter has spoken of it is interesting that coloureds and blacks traditionally support the all blacks when they play at newlands is the team that has been selected of such a nature that it will ensure the support of most south africans
3729783 we cannot repeat the cycle of the white era we must build for 2011 it is easy to fall into a comfort zone peter should be reminded of his mandate its not all about transformation but it transformation is an important part of it not one black player has let south africa down this year

3729791 four years is a lifetime when we came in we had no agreements signed with public works or the police the next council wont have to worry about that in the next three years thats major
3729792 the last four years ive enjoyed it to a point theres too much involved with personalities though i wish i was 20 years younger because people who say you cant do things are totally wrong
3729793 i think young people should get their nomination papers and run for office there are a lot of young people who would make great councilors in the community

3729797 kids can remind their parents to bring their re usable bags shopping with them and they can help parents pick out items with less packaging
3729798 in the six years ive been doing this people are more aware of recycling and we do recycle more than we used to about 50 per cent of our waste is recycled but the amount of waste we produce has also gone way up
3729799 what bothers me is that we are wasting our resources
3729800 plastic comes from petroleum and just look at our petroleum prices
3729801 if we recycle one ton of paper we end up saving 17 trees
3729802 and by recycling just one pop can we save enough energy to run our tv for three hours
3729803 its a lot cheaper to recycle than it is to use our raw materials plus were not depleting our raw materials when we recycle
3729804 they do not have the mental agility to all at once see 10 sides of any item
3729805 like when that 50 year old korean guy tried to fight you and steve for entering his club and then you guys threw a bucket of 4 day old kentucky fried chicken that was in your car at him and then drove away

3729830 if johnson follows through on this his actual legal name will be chad ocho cinco and the nfl would then we assume allow him to put his new last name on the back of his jersey from a business standpoint this might be chads way of picking up some of the extra cash that he wants to make but that the team has said it wont give him the jersey would instantly become one of the nfls top sellers and nfl players get a cut of all sales of their jerseys
3729831 it was wonderful enough to do it in the 100

3729854 i went to your store the other day thanks again
3729855 you know with this internet thing taking off there really needs to be a website where people can post pictures of themselves taken in the mirror and they can write call them blogs because it sounds cool about what they ate for breakfast or containing really bad poetry no name bands and artists can make themselves sound relevant it can have all kinds of scary unintended consequences like murder extortion and viral marketing what do you think

3729857 we want to give movie and video game makers the tools necessary to animate actors and have their hair look and behave as it would in the real world
3729858 our graphics group at uc san diego helped to create computer graphics algorithms that do the same thing for hairstyles
3729859 to make hair that looks like hair you have to think in terms of individual fibers
3729860 you cant just blend the highlight from two different angles to get a realistic highlight for a point in between
3729861 our method produces strands attached to the scalp that enable animation in contrast existing approaches retrieve only the visible hair layer
3729862 the global models are good for investigating whats likely to happen on a planetary scale but the resolution is quite coarse when looking at a more localised regional scale
3729863 its a bit like enlarging a digital photograph until it becomes pixellated and all sorts of detail is blurred out
3729864 simulating the climate of the region is a challenge for climate models due in part to the high natural inter annual variability the topography of the region which includes multiple mountain ranges and inland seas and the presence of a slight cooling trend in recent decades despite the global trend being a warming
3729865 we need to confirm this result with other models but a 50 per cent increase in rainfall in such an important agricultural area is a much more hopeful scenario than a 15 per cent decline
3729866 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt and whose background you are beginning to wonder about she has brought real results and even his words today are in doubt invented for a campaign ultimately he cannot win against john mccain
3729867 must now in earnest show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3729868 does anyone believe it is possible to win the nomination without over these two months raising all these issues against him
3729869 a nice campaign that wins the states alone that can be won will that be enough or do serious issues have to raised about him
3729870 his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3729871 we are never going to say anything about his background we have to show the value of ours when it comes to making decisions understanding the needs of most americans the invisible americans
3729872 lets explicitly own american in our programs the speeches and the values he doesnt

3729874 apart from australia and japan my samples were small and confined to young middle class urbanites nevertheless this study is unusual because it covers so many nations and the comparisons offer some interesting food for thought
3729875 overall the results show that young men and women are divided on the issues of sharing housework and a womans right to have an abortion it should come as no surprise that young women are more in favour of domestic democracy than the young men while also being more supportive of a womans right to have an abortion
3729876 it is interesting to note that those in western countries tend to see sharing housework and role reversal as similar ideas whereas most of those from asian countries who are also supportive of sharing housework were quite opposed to role reversal while this might indicate to some people that greater equality exists in the western countries another interpretation is that it demonstrates the greater commitment to the fathers bread winning role in the asian countries
3729877 while performing housework and childcare was seen as nothing short of emasculation for many of the young men in my study this does not prevent them from claiming their rights in relation to abortion decisions
3729878 the chinese people surveyed were the most accepting of a womans right to have an abortion with both males and females seeing this as her decision in some cases the chinese responses asserted that both parents had responsibilities in relation to the child but it was the womans right alone to choose an abortion

3729883 almost exactly four years after that campaign against sen john kerry began mr corsi has released a new attack book painting senator barack obama the democrats presumed presidential nominee as a stealth radical liberal who has tried to cover up extensive connections to islam mr obama is christian and questioning whether his admitted experimentation with drugs in high school and college ever ceased
3729884 significant parts of the book whose subtitle is leftist politics and the cult of personality have already been challenged as misleading or false in the days since its debut on aug 1 nonetheless it is to make its first appearance on the new york times best seller list for nonfiction hardcovers this sunday at no 1

3729913 he goes its not how many times you get knocked down but its how many times you get back up and go forward carl latz said his son told him
3729914 and i told him thats exactly what this is all about and if nothing else this letter just taught you a life lesson
3729915 well the law prohibits it and the legislature enacted the laws to protect the health safety and welfare of all children
3729916 it seems totally unbelievable that somebody would even go to that extreme to send a letter to somebody let alone looking to find something about child labor laws
3729917 if my doors close and i never open again and this boy becomes successful then i will be the happiest person in the world
3729918 its strange that a kid at this age would glean onto this particular kind of music and show the intensity and kind of the ability to function as kind of 8 year old blues guy

3729932 the west is supporting one palestinian faction over the other its all about politics not human rights
3729933 we have warned of the pa turning into a security regime and there are indications that we are heading in that direction
3729934 in other words a peace process that undermined palestinian democracy created a peace partner fatah so hated by its own people that the israeli army must now protect them
3729935 where is the money that was supposedly spent on reforming the judicial system where is the international outrage as palestinian leaders drag their own society further into the abyss
3729936 the appalling fact only fitfully reported in north america is that the two major palestinian factions are committed to an often murderous conflict

3729938 the fact that a couple requires medical help in order to bring a child into the world
3729939 does not give the mans wife a substantial right to prevent the fertilization a right that she does not have in normal circumstances where the fertilization would take place naturally without medical help
3729940 this is not sufficient to give the wife a legal right to prevent ties between her husband and the woman including child bearing

3729944 to build a summer camp for israeli teenagers in development towns and to enrich the college students themselves to better understand the nature of what they were doing
3729945 we had a few days of seminar session both before and after the camp in which we analyzed what we were doing here what does it mean to be a privileged jew who has the ability to give to others what is the concept of tikkun olam lit repairing the world are we engaged in tzedakah charity or tzedek justice what exactly is our role here what is our motivation why specifically in israel and not with underprivileged children in new york we also discussed the talmudic debate on the relative merits of one who is obligated vis a vis one who volunteers these and others were important issues for us to explore
3729946 simply to establish ties with the youth here and teach english with no ulterior motives such as bringing them closer to judaism we didnt exactly know what that meant at first but we gradually came to understand the importance of just making connections we also learned much about the cultural divides that still separate the various groups the russian immigrants and the sephardim from morocco and those from iran etc we were happy that the camp gave them a chance to some extent to realize what they had in common such as when we took them on trips and the like
3729947 there were some kids who we sometimes called the art room terrorists
3729948 empower and build the next generation of israeli youth by providing them with important life skills

3729950 when you see a boy who has trouble sitting through the english language class without making trouble and then he starts doodling with his pencil and is discovered to really have great drawing skill and to see him finally get praised for something and realize that he is worth something for me that was truly an experience that made it all worth it
3729951 although for most of us aliyah is already on our agenda
3729952 the desire of conference organizers and participants to use israel for large international conferences is a sign of the positive change in israels image and attraction as a tourist destination

3729957 who even remembers the names of the towns there we dont want the same to happen with gush katif gush katif will be in the heart of israeli society
3729958 yesterday we had a feature on channel two jerusalem mayoral candidate nir barkats people have called us to arrange a visit and there is interest were very optimistic
3729959 some visitors thought that we should be a bit more militant
3729960 they felt that we should display the numbers of unemployed all the governments broken promises and the like we do have an impressive room with some stark photos of the actual expulsion but in general our goal is not to weaken but rather to strengthen we are not blurring over the difficult reality we face but we want to give a positive sense of what life in gush katif was like
3729961 contempt targeted at the nation which suffered from genocide is not casual hooliganism it is a destructive and sordid act against lithuania as a whole not only lithuanias jewish community

3729963 the skulls were found plastered that is to say sculpted which is a phenomenon that is identified with the new stone age
3729964 the practice included the reconstruction of all of the facial features of the deceased by means of sculpting the skull with a variety of materials such as plaster that was specifically intended for this on the skulls that were found in the excavation the nose was entirely reconstructed
3729965 some time thereafter the residents would dig up the grave retrieve the skull from the rest of the skeleton and recover the grave
