6100123 this suggests that arsenic would play a role in the development of diabetes
6100124 but there clearly needs to be additional research conducted because our study has certain limitations we are conducting those studies now but thats going to take a few years
6100125 this is a good base for future research but its a small sample size and doesnt look at dose response
6100126 in terms of magnitude people in taiwan and bangladesh are exposed to at least 10 times higher levels compared to people in the u s
6100127 we were interested in investigating if arsenic exposure at low and moderate levels could be related to diabetes
6100128 when we adjusted for diabetes risk factors and for markers of seafood intake we found this moderate to strong relationship between arsenic and the prevalence of diabetes
6100129 there are still many americans with arsenic in drinking water at levels above safety standards
6100130 this reinforces how important it is that all drinking water is below this standard the good news is that we can actually do something to eliminate arsenic from water

6100177 yet we have a tendency to be cautious of exciting stories that are broad based with many people jumping on the bandwagon deep scrutiny is often missed because the theme is so compelling and thereby must be rational
6100178 since farmer wealth is heavily influenced by real estate values such spikes should be looked on with concern
6100179 keep in mind that household net equity in real estate as a per cent of household net worth is far lower than it is for farmers yet everyone seems worried about weaker home prices for consumers and do not seem bothered at all by a plausible pullback in farmland values given the recent pattern

6100231 when you add up the minutes its 12 extra days we are teaching
6100232 but its a one year contract so things could be modified next year
6100233 i liken this contract to building a house while youre living in it
6100234 they made decisions without collaboration and input from teachers on many things
6100235 ability and willingness to deal directly and fairly with faculty staff students and parents
6100236 in math it really matters that the teacher knows the subject matter well
6100237 the need is such that recruiting new teachers alone will not be enough we also really need to retrain the teachers we have
6100238 weve had a very large increase in the number of math teachers coming out of csu
6100239 the first week i was like wow i have my own students
6100240 i want to do this for the rest of my life
6100241 she has the opportunity to interact with students in ways that a teacher cannot
6100242 linda bell made that school the kind of place you wanted to come to every day
6100243 linda bell helped me succeed as a student and as a person
6100244 the minute you take her out you take out all the fun that students have
6100245 the positions will remain open until oct 4 we hope that when we get more information from the state well be able to look at restoring some of these positions
6100246 theres a discrepancy here between what we say we believe in and what we actually do in deed
6100247 we talk about believing in educating the whole child and yet were cutting a person who is dedicated to their social and emotional support i cant in good conscience vote to cut that position
6100248 when the reality hits and the real results of the budget start staring you in face its hard
6100249 now that were getting ready for the opening of school and we dont have those positions back were very concerned
6100250 were not really hearing very much from sacramento lately but the projections arent very good
6100251 the governor has talked about midyear cuts once the budget is passed i hope the legislators will be able to broker a budget and keep this from happening its one thing to operate with a reduced budget but to have more taken away midyear i hope that doesnt happen
6100252 investeringsmaatschappijen kennen alleen de logica van het rendement niet de logica van het bedienen van klanten
6100253 van de bedrijven die door private equity worden overgenomen gaat 15 procent binnen tien tot vijftien jaar failliet normaal gesproken ligt dit percentage op 4 procent
6100254 dat wreekt zich pas na een langere periode van meer dan vijf jaar uitendelijk verliezen bedrijven hierdoor meestal klanten omdat ze niet innovatief genoeg meer zijn
6100255 bij investeringen in nieuwe diensten wordt soms extra gediscussieerd of ze uiteindelijk voldoende opleveren
6100256 als het rentepercentage stijgt en de inkomsten vallen wat tegen raakt het bedrijf al snel in moeilijkheden
6100257 op dit moment kunnen de renteniveaus en de eisen die banken stellen alleen maar toenemen
6100258 ze cre ren waarde door bijvoorbeeld een ineffici nte fusie terug te draaien
6100259 ze maken dus eerder gemaakte fouten weer goed het zou echter beter zijn als deze fouten niet worden gemaakt
6100260 a request by gen david mckiernan the commander of nato forces in afghanistan for three u s brigades with support staff has been approved
6100261 reluctant to endorse deep or rapid reductions if they jeopardized his goal of establishing a stable and democratic government in baghdad
6100262 we really have to get down in iraq below 15 brigade combat teams for us to consider adding multiple additional brigades to afghanistan
6100263 the push by the insurgents has taken a rising toll before the attack on monday 173 foreign soldiers had been killed in afghanistan this year including 99 americans in all of 2007 232 foreign troops were killed the highest number since the war began in 2001
6100264 greater freedom of movement the militants have in pakistans tribal areas on the afghan border
6100265 seen as vital to reconciling the deep seated tensions among iraqs political and sectarian groups
6100266 explosive quarrel over the city is one major barrier to creating stable political structures in the rest of iraq
6100267 reminiscent of the sectarian attacks once carried out regularly by shiite dominated security forces and could inflame sectarian tensions in the fragile province
6100268 you just have to take a deep breath and relax
6100269 the traffic was really bad today its just one long line there is only one way in and one way out
6100270 i like school and theres a lot of fun things here like the playground
6100271 so garry what have you been doing all these years
6100272 nothing man just working hard on my highly successful blog called blog fork
6100273 forking off doing nothing being an idiot it caters to the crn

6100275 i decided that i would come out and leave everything ive got on the track and i did just that
6100276 we have invited objections and suggestions till next month after which the drafts will be notified
6100277 attempt by the anti car fanatics to screw up our traffic on behalf of the bicycle fantasy
6100278 the behavior of the bike people on city streets is always annoying
6100279 this get out of my way im not burning fossil fuels
6100280 regardless of the obvious dangers some people will ride bikes in san francisco for the same reason islamic fanatics will engage in suicide bombings because they are politically motivated to do so
6100281 in case anyone doubted that you were a wingnut this statement pretty much sums things up
6100282 phelps and his american rival ryan lochte who is also a fan of jeezy greet each other by saying juh in homage to the rapper a k a jay jenkins
6100283 it would be great if i could holler at phelps
6100284 and its a compliment that that man found inspiration in the music i do for the streets over here over there in beijing
6100285 oddly enough so fresh so clean is a good one
6100286 yes b o b is another one a rare outkast track on stankonia featuring cee lo called speedballin is another
6100287 our goal is to provide as many resources as we possibly can to ensure safety
6100288 hear a lot of whats going on among the students
6100289 microsoft was a patent hawk client for years they had every opportunity for friendly sic discussion the words patent tax were used and microsoft chose a path consistent with their corporate culture
6100290 what we do in the next two to three years will determine our future this is the defining moment
6100291 the united states has been unwilling to adopt and to sustain policy measures that would slow the trend and begin the long process of a transition to a post petroleum economy our citizens and their elected representatives do not wish to sacrifice in the short run the convenience and economic benefits of low cost energy
6100292 the first presidential candidate to introduce into the public dialogue a new understanding of security and the means to achieve it will have demonstrated the kind of leadership worthy of election and of governance
6100293 the evidence over the past 12 to 18 months suggests that we have underestimated how fast this aspect of the earths system can change

6100296 it didnt take them really three or four days to get into georgia and it really shouldnt take them three or four days to get out
6100297 this is a moment in history when it is vital for the worlds democracies to stand in solidarity
6100298 were trying not to provoke them otherwise theyll stay here for five to six months
6100299 it didnt take them really three or four days to get into georgia and it really shouldnt take them three or four days to get out
6100300 this is a moment in history when it is vital for the worlds democracies to stand in solidarity
6100301 john joseph adams was kind enough to indulge my pleas and e mailed electronic copies of wastelands the best reprint themed anthology i have read this last couple years and of his then forthcoming now freshly trailered seeds of change where at least half of the stories will or deserve to show up in next years awards final ballots this book reminded me why i started to love science fiction in the first place with the stories focus on the paradigms of change and an almost militant engagement that stands out in a sea of simple entertainment
6100302 from an editorial perspective i think maybe that we dont often enough challenge writers to be great not all stories or writers have greatness inside of them but i think that perhaps too often we accept and publish good stories that truly could be great if the writer was just pushed to make it great it seems like editors used to do this routinely if one can accept the statements one reads in historical accounts at face value editors like john w campbell and harlan ellison are frequently cited as having done a lot to mold and shape the fiction they published it could be that this is still happening today but i dont hear about it very often and dont often see it instead i find myself reading good stories in which i find greatness lurking inside them i dont know what the reason for this is or even if it is a true problem good stories are after all good but its something ive been thinking about
6100303 having this research partnership with hp labs will bring the necessary focus and drive to make a positive contribution to augmented reality a field of computer research combining real world and computer generated data it is a big challenge as with any other area of research and we are looking forward to starting the work

6100310 when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6100311 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6100312 it is an agreement which will help us to respond to the threats of the 21st century
6100313 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6100314 when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988

6100319 when he went missing we searched him but couldnt find him i was helpless being the only member of the family i was facing problems i looked for him in various areas of the village on my bicycle for five years couldnt find him but now he is back
6100320 the rajasthan police team approached us after they found him in indo pakistan border he has been missing for 20 years from his home the rajasthan police on getting some information about his native place brought him here where we identified him and released him to his family
6100321 this is a political conspiracy we have some opponents who are fighting from within and are trying to sabotage the agitation
6100322 he has an incredible long stride which affords him the ability to cover more ground he has been able to take that long stride that he has and combine it with technique and with his high turnover he can destroy the field
6100323 he ratan tata made a commitment that the dhamra port which tata steel is building right now in orissa if there is any likelihood of damage to the environment he will reconsider the location of the port there is every evidence now which proves that it will not only push turtles one step closer to extinction it will also upset the fragile bio diversity there
6100324 its very difficult to be a career person and have a relationship i didnt succeed at doing it at all its incredibly hard
6100325 i think you have to figure out some way of keeping all of those capabilities and requirements in your life in balance
6100326 i just dont feel turning 40 is seminal or major in any way i like my life right now i really like it whatever its taken to get here i appreciate
6100327 titi did a lot to help us defend last year
6100328 but this year his work will be scoring goals the ones at the back have to defend as well as the midfielders in order to help him be freer
6100329 one verse will shatter your spine and crush your spirit no matter what you still window shop for lyrics

6100336 the peace corps has been in touch with our state department and the liberia folks and it looks like were going to start moving some teams pretty quickly back into liberia
6100337 the government of liberia requests the re establishment of the peace corps program in liberia we understand that the peace corps has a program peace corps response which allows experienced volunteers to serve for short periods to perform high impact work such short term projects aimed at raising the capacities and capabilities of liberian teachers would have a profound impact upon civil society as a whole
6100338 were pleased to see so many positive developments in liberia as well as the countrys renewed focus on education the peace corps is proud to continue the agencys legacy of providing education volunteers to liberia and to be able to contribute to the countrys development efforts
6100339 its not the kind of thing that we in our wildest dreams would expect to happen in our hospitals in our wildest nightmares i guess

6100343 im not sure how we top britney opening the show but we are looking on it every minute of every day
6100344 in einer gesellschaft die sich demokratisch nennt wird man sich daran gew hnen m ssen dass manche den mund auftun wenn sie es f r richtig halten und auch zeitpunkt und ort ihrer u erungen selbst bestimmen
6100345 we have spoken to his manager and basically told him if there is on option out there worth looking at then we are happy for him to explore it
6100346 eric has a contract here for the next couple of years and we are happy to honour that
6100347 all we have done is give him the option of having a look elsewhere and seeing whats out there and seeing if there is an opportunity for him
6100348 there were erics defensive problems earlier in the season and i dont think there is any doubt not having centre ben smith inside him like he did last season contributed to that
6100349 but the emergence of joel reddy and taulima tautai is another contributing factor
6100350 die kraft f r eine nachhaltige erholung des euro fehlt
6100351 we lit up your world like the fourth of july
6100352 i won the world championships last year and that was just a taste of greater things to come
6100353 winning the medal last year told me i can run with the best of them and i can run under pressure
6100354 i knew i was there or thereabouts and the olympic gold just confirms what i already knew
6100355 everyone sees the energy when the grand prix come to london its so vibrant here and i know that will be mirrored in 2012
6100356 i honestly dont think that she is dirty i think that she is a clean athlete who just missed the tests and i know that is hard to keep up with sometimes
6100357 we needed to bolster the squad particularly with our european aspirations as well as our domestic hopes this season
6100358 we want to do well in all competitions if we went into the campaign with only five recognised defenders in myself zat knight martin laursen nicky shorey and luke young then it would have looked a bit light
6100359 if one got injured theres not much cover carlos has come in and that makes the whole set up look more secure it also provides competition for places which is what any footballer wants it keeps you on your toes
6100360 i know he is scottish player of the year and did well for rangers when they got to the final of the uefa cup you know if the manager pays that sort of money for someone that he will be a good player
6100361 i need to concentrate on my game step up my performances and hope he doesnt take my place in the team
6100362 theres more to come from curtis davies in essence i am still finding my feet a bit
6100363 i am just trying to defend properly at the moment doing the bread and butter things getting my head onto things and if the ball needs kicking it goes
6100364 makybe diva has taken to motherhood as a true professional
6100365 she has come through the foaling in fantastic order and we look forward to welcoming them home to makybe in coming weeks
6100366 tony is currently on vacation and was anxiously awaiting the phone call he was extremely happy to hear it was a filly but more important they are both fit and well
6100367 makybe diva has taken to motherhood as a true professional
6100368 she has come through the foaling in fantastic order and we look forward to welcoming them home to makybe in coming weeks
6100369 there were never any grudges to bear in waratahland its done and dusted
6100370 it was four years ago and if you bear grudges for that long you grow into a grey man
6100371 i spent 3 years overseas and was able to move on from there
6100372 the only difference now is that i am walking down in a coachs shirt rather than a playing shirt
6100373 its great to look around here and bring back memories of what was a great time at nsw rugby it was a big part of my life for so long and its always good to come back
6100374 its good to be asked to be involved and hopefully i can add to some of the kicking skills and the back three work
6100375 and looking around there are certainly some guys who have some kicking ability thats for sure
6100376 its not a matter of size its a matter of skill
6100377 i would love to fight mundine he says he wants to take on the best middleweights 72kg in the world but lets see how he goes against a junior welterweight 64kg first in terms of skill i would give him a boxing lesson
6100378 mundine looked dreadful against japanese fighter crazy kim last month
6100379 im old enough and small enough for mundine to see me as a prospective opponent
6100380 hopefully i did enough against south africa to keep conversations going and seal something
6100381 tom is bitterly disappointed at the outcome and so are we as a club
6100382 i cant see the difference in the tackle from the others presented at the hearing
6100383 if you look at todd paytens tackle which was a grade two i cant believe toms was two more than paytens i dont know what we do wrong
6100384 no i dont if you look at raiders skipper alan tongue earlier this year he got smashed by a bloke off the ball and he doesnt get anything i just dont know what they look at when they review things
6100385 so i came out in the second half with that in mind and when ben cross ran at me i made a point of getting lower i usually target the ball
6100386 when i did hit him i lost shoulder contact and only had one of his legs i didnt expect him to flip up as easy as he did at that stage he was past the horizontal and i couldnt get him back i attempted to take the force out of the driving motion so he didnt land on his head too hard
6100387 it was undoubtedly a position player cross found himself in and regretted just as learoyd lahrs was regrettable but this has to be avoided not apologised for afterwards
6100388 it also has to be absolutely clear these type of tackles will not and cannot be tolerated
6100389 its good to use your bad experiences for a positive
6100390 look ive had a great run in the game in my opinion
6100391 people always say oh what happened this that and the other
6100392 but a lot of people would have given their right arm to have played at the level i played
6100393 whats happened has happened in the past five years i take my responsibility for that as well
6100394 i am just happy now to be back and if people want to laud me as an ambassador thats an added bonus
6100395 i still have a long way to go in terms of playing wise and in terms of off the field
6100396 but its time for me to put something back not only to football but to the community in using the experiences ive had to help people who are less fortunate than me
6100397 and we started that last night when we went to a charity called essere
6100398 because of whats happened to me in the past five years drug addiction broken marriage i have more of an awareness
6100399 its so easy when you have bad experiences to become bitter and to take that anger out and use that negative energy for something that is negative
6100400 i think i have a duty and responsibility to do that
6100401 in terms of long term playing my parents asked me that this morning i am just taking it step by step again its a little tick in the box
6100402 when you have been out for so long there is always the danger that coming back to that level of intensity of training can maybe put you off but i have actually enjoyed it

6100413 federal immigration minister diane finley had almost 15 000 worth of security equipment installed at her residence and riding office because of concerns over her personal safety sun media has learned security measures for the minister were tightened in the wake of threats received due to her efforts to stop women being brought to canada to work as strippers sources told the canadian press last spring no details have been given on the nature of these threats but the same sources confirmed they were directly tied to the conservative bill that aimed to deny entry into the country to strippers and that organized crime was behind them
6100414 it should be the boards who make this call not the players
6100415 at the end of the day its our call there is absolute clarity about that
6100416 they know our view we are not proposing to do any more until we hear from them
6100417 we are confident that the icc has got a very clear understanding of what the views are around not just australia but a number of senior icc member nations
6100418 with the champions trophy 20 days away shouldnt that have been the main talking point
6100419 thats a hypothetical question sri lanka has its own issues but certainly the security concerns in sri lanka while they are real are no where near as difficult as they are in pakistan

6100423 its basically just having students go over to countries and learn about different cultures and bring the world together
6100424 we learned about their culture and what they do on a daily basis
6100425 they taught us how to weave baskets and i actually got to try kangaroo tail theyre very resourceful they use everything
6100426 its been marvelous especially with the olympics going on and my son having seen everything that theyre showing in china
6100427 with katie going to australia both children are worldwide travelers and my husband and i dont go anywhere
6100428 it may not show right away but just traveling in different parts of the world and meeting other people thats a positive
6100429 they give you your passport and they expect you to keep it if you lose it you cant go home
6100430 this part of the program is really the heart of people to people promoting understanding and peace from person to person and what better way to do that than to spend two nights in the home of a local family
6100431 having meals with them watching television or playing games with them these are all great ways to get to know how people really live in the country
6100432 you contain your infrastructure but you also contain the heat thats generated from the servers
6100433 we are working incredibly hard to improve the energy efficiency of our data centers
6100434 we are not physically building our servers but there is very deep engagement with the computer makers
6100435 search was a very large portion of our demand in fiscal year 2008
6100436 going into this year it is still a very large proportion it is now not as dominant as it was last year
6100437 one of the big drivers for us that i see is the move to ip based delivery of rich video
6100438 perhaps companies will want to put windfarms atop our bridges and skyscrapers or use the enormous potential of powerful off shore winds miles out in the atlantic ocean where turbines could generate roughly twice the energy that land based windfarms can
6100439 we want their best ideas for creating both small and large scale projects serving new yorkers
6100440 if rooftop wind can make it anywhere this is a great city
6100441 i was amused to read davids comments that he would rather his side suffered relegation every other season than be like middlesbrough david is a good friend but i can only assume relegation has affected his thinking a little
6100442 i seriously doubt boro fans would swap our recent histories
6100443 since moving to the riverside in 1995 we have achieved five major cup finals are the only english side outside of the so called big four to have played in a european final have enjoyed successive seasons of uefa cup football won our first major trophy and enjoyed 11 consecutive years in the premier league
6100444 unfortunately chris smith had to pull out of the scotland under 21 squad
6100445 he has been suffering with a niggling injury for a few weeks which has been gradually getting worse although he had been trying to work through it
6100446 he did report along with scott cuthbert to the scotland under 21 assembly on sunday night but he was sent back to the club
6100447 im disappointed for chris that he cant get away with the scotland under 21 squad as he may have had a chance of representing his country but the most important thing is his fitness

6100449 you have heard that it was said you shall not commit adultery but i say to you that have neglected the weightier provisions of the law justice and mercy and faithfulness but these are the things you should have done without neglecting the others
6100450 and he sat down opposite the treasury and began observing how the people were putting money into the treasury and many rich people were putting in large sums
6100451 truly i say to you this poor widow put in more than all the contributors to the treasury for they all put in out of their surplus but she out of her poverty put in all she owned all she had to live on
6100452 but he must ask in faith without any doubting for the one who doubts is like the surf of the sea driven and tossed by the wind

6100487 obviously you have to find a way to bowl some dots against him and build a bit of pressure because he is one of the worlds best if not the best at the moment
6100488 he has got all the shots and new ones i see it as a challenge because no one else out there does it so i would like to see what i do if he does it
6100489 we have had a few chats and some of the senior guys have an idea what i should do
6100490 if he moves late you cannot do anything if the ball has already left your hand
6100491 if he does move early you maybe could pull out but i suppose it is also a good opportunity for a wicket if you get it right if he is totally turning around then his head is moving but you have to acknowledge he has done it well so far i have seen him five to 10 times and he has never failed
6100492 if we can set it up early and take a lead i am sure the confidence should take us through to the end and we can win the series
6100493 during that period i had to really think about my bowling and be really on my game so that if something didnt feel right with my bowling i knew what it was
6100494 that helped me to groove my action and feel my action a bit more so i can work it out if something goes wrong
6100495 celebrities like to spend their millions barack obama is no different only its your money he wants to spend

6100498 although jerome corsis book the obama nation has been out for just a brief period it is already clear that it has failed to put a real dent in senator obamas candidacy the book may sell to hardcore conservatives but its electoral impact will be minimal

6100507 well uh you know i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or uh a scientific perspective uh answering that question with specificity uh you know is is uh above my pay grade
6100508 well take up later the question of how we can determine whether a limit exists for
6100509 we believe that such a transfer is not in the interest of the public
6100510 you are giving the land to a private land trust that isnt necessarily open to the public or public influence and there is no guarantee this land trust is going to keep the door open to the public you are giving it to a land trust set up by a developer that stands to make bucket loads of money if the toll road goes through
6100511 seattle center will be attractive inviting to people of all ages and affordable for everyone
6100512 people shouldnt have to purchase tickets or go to a performance to go to seattle center it should be a major attraction as any park would be
6100513 it is a long range plan so we will be paying for it incrementally over time
6100514 its going to be a combination of private money foundation money and public money much as previous improvements to the center have been
6100515 you should take the counselor very seriously and be very forthcoming with the counselor so that the counselor can help you do a thorough job of making sure that a reverse mortgage is really the answer for you
6100516 i think seniors still need to be careful that they are not talked into a loan that they dont really need
6100517 if there is hurricane or flood damage to the home that you cant repair the loan is due
6100518 if you cant repay the loan you will lose your house
6100519 unless a senior intends to die in their home they want to be very careful about getting involved with one of these products because it is a never ending pit of debt
6100520 if you go into a nursing home for longer than 12 months the loan is due
6100521 if you cant stay home for quite a few years then its a bad deal
6100522 on our opening day we had a lot of good reactions
6100523 i thought the adults would come in and say oh this is so cute but a lot of adults took it seriously it made us feel better
6100524 our earth is deteriorating and as much as we try to convey the message were still going to be using our cars were still going to be wasting our energy by showing people this exhibit it will educate people about what we can do
6100525 one idea is to have a lot of murals and public art
6100526 we were working with artists who really believed that art could bring the community together we wanted to bring together different cultures through public art we set up an outdoor stage for performers
6100527 there was this one girl who was into bringing a lot of culture i was interested in bringing technology it was interesting bringing all these ideas into one plan
6100528 we realized that with all the issues that are going on if we dont take a stand then nobody will
6100529 people dont really take kids seriously we thought if we put something out there showing our point of view they would

6100533 nothing has really happened with downtown in almost two decades
6100534 a reconfigure of a street here a change of direction for a one way street there kill a whole foods grocery store here stop a complete face lift on broadway there on and on it goes
6100535 wally always accuses me of being the glass is half empty guy
6100536 he is the vision guy im more of the detail guy
6100537 i dont know how we would have managed without him stepping up for that role
6100538 it was asking a lot of him to be in that position
6100539 nathan received so much input constantly about decisions that he could have comfortably made on his own it required an extra degree of dedication for the project
6100540 he maintains his buildings well he is responsive to tenants needs through the whole building process he was good to work with he has sharp attention to detail in terms of the cost of construction and the design needs of the tenants
6100541 it was broadcasting but i always wanted to do construction
6100542 ive never heard of anybody being helped by one of those for profit consultants
6100543 even if they do provide services its nothing that you cant get for free and to me thats the biggest fraud of all
6100544 i thought the way the company was treating me was very cruel and i knew they were doing this others

6100557 its a shock to me and to her agents that this is happening i dont think the family is making the right choice theres definitely more to lose than to gain
6100558 ive put too much time and effort into michelle to be able to sit by and watch this happening without saying something if she doesnt stick to doing whats sensible we could see one of the greatest potential talents the game has ever known going to waste

6100563 la notizia enfatizzata dalla stampa riguardante il presunto trasferimento di un esecutore di vigilanza ex lsu destituita da ogni fondamento ed il maldestro tentativo di far apparire
6100564 tale provvedimento continua la nota del palazzo di citt si inserisce in un quadro pi articolato di revisione e riorganizzazione della pianta organica che ha riguardato non il solo operatore oggetto della rimostranza ma pi dipendenti assegnati al settore di polizia amministrativa e vigilanza tale iniziativa trova la sua motivazione anche in reiterate richieste della sigla sindacale che contesta il provvedimento poich da pi tempo viene sollecitato un pi puntuale e corretto utilizzo del suddetto personale che tra laltro da questa amministrazione stato stabilizzato nei ruoli comunali con profili professionali rispecchianti compiti e mansioni svolti nelle attivit progettuali dei lavoratori socialmente utili
6100565 appare strumentalmente pretestuoso continua la nota liniziativa del sindacato che in modo palesemente scorretto ha posto in evidenza solo il provvedimento dellesecutore di vigilanza ex lsu che non ha nessuna connotazione punitiva tralasciando volutamente il contesto in cui avvenuto che si ribadisce quello e solo quello di una pi corretta e razionale organizzazione della macchina amministrativa sostenere che tutto ci sarebbe avvenuto per una meschina rivalsa nei confronti di una multa elevata a carico di un amministratore appare talmente assurdo e ridicolo da non meritare alcun commento ulteriore non tra laltro superfluo precisare che a tuttoggi nessun avviso e o notifica di contravvenzione pervenuto ad alcuno degli amministratori della citt di castrovillari

6100579 the nfl looks at that from not only working with a quarterback but an offensive tackle who protects a drop back passer
6100580 the skills havent translated well the footwork has been awful look at joe flacco from delaware last year he had the arm and the size and the skills to work with but he has the talent to develop you need to have the right scouting and coaching to figure out the player and not the system i never thought vince young was going to translate well to the nfl he had way too far to go and alex smith was an aberration it was a down year for quarterbacks
6100581 an isolated problem caused by a very specific hdd error
6100582 it has given a very good message in our country
6100583 specifically keeping into the mind that child rights violations or negligence to the childrens rights are time and again conducted in the name of continuum of tradition and in the name of religion also
6100584 not only on the basis of the child act convention but also on the basis of the courts decision the new constitution should very clearly mention specifically about the role and responsibility of the state towards providing the childrens rights in practice

6100590 the olympic games serve as an apt metaphor and occur at an appropriate time to remind the nations educators and parents that we need to acknowledge this widespread problem and work harder to engage boys in reading
6100591 boys have trouble reading because they dont get to read for a purpose that makes any sense to them
6100592 as a society we need to make more of an effort to connect boys with many different kinds of reading both at home and at school
6100593 if we can expand the notion of what reading is well have a better chance of inspiring boys to want to be readers this means broadening our definition of reading to include boy friendly nonfiction humor sports comics graphic novels action adventure magazines websites and newspapers boys need to know that these materials count as reading
6100594 we can help boys become readers by giving them a reason to want to become readers
6100595 this approach opens the door and the mind once a boy starts reading he will be more receptive to many other types of reading over his lifetime
6100596 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6100597 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6100598 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants

6100603 we believe that he should come clean and admit that he has misrepresented his vote in the past on this born alive infant protection act and that he should apologize to those that he has called liars
6100604 i hate to say that people are lying but heres a situation where folks are lying
6100605 i would have been completely in fully in support of the federal bill that everybody supported which was to say that you should provide assistance to any infant that was born even if it was as a consequence of an induced abortion that was not the bill that was presented at the state level
6100606 i think the american people need to know how extreme he is and the role that he played on this
6100607 the suggestion that obama the proud father of two little girls and others who opposed these bills supported infanticide is deeply offensive and insulting the bills senator obama voted against in illinois were crafted to undermine roe v wade or pre existing illinois state law
6100608 i knew it was the case but it doesnt really concern me

6100611 i think its kind of irrelevant for me to consider at this point
6100612 i have different speeds on different days sometimes im feeling good in the 1 000 sometimes good in the 500 my results say i am probably more consistent in the 500 but i think thats probably because there are more guys that are consistently world class in the 1 000

6100645 earlier people tolerated prime time because there was no choice they can now choose what where and when they want
6100646 we realized early on that the younger generation of tomorrow will consume video differently than has been the case traditionally we are working on programming keeping this in mind for example we will soon premiere a made for internet 90 part series of three minute episodes called akbar birbal remixed the old stories of wit and wisdom will be narrated in a contemporary avatar by characters shaped along the lines of munnabhai and circuit of the munnabhai mbbs movie fame
6100647 the pre launch on youtube allows us to get feedback and comments from users who no longer have to wait in front of mtv for a music video to come up it can be pulled on demand the viral element means a global audience from day one helping us get shows as far as bogota the flip side is viewers can switch off if they dont like something in the three minute society we live in now you get all of three minutes to gain or lose an audience
6100648 a new digital divide is developing and it is not represented by economics but by mindset today a legion of executives are deliberately deciding not to experiment and or use social media tools little do they realize that they risk leaving a legacy in their organizations as the ones that missed the social media revolution
6100649 our internal blogs are a storehouse for all that is happening within the organization staff are alerted when something new is posted from them to read and comment the contest to predict ratings is also a part of it we have an software to predict this for us and a contest like this encourages media planners to use this system
6100650 we had set up blogs in one of my previous companies innoviti embedded solutions the idea being to brainstorm ideas and evolve consensus spanning over days and weeks it was a start up and there was a need to document processes share the managements vision with employees and share ideas different functions sales engineering and finance posted important events updates and problems for more efficient coordination and finding solutions together
6100651 infosys tcs mahindra amp mahindra and many other leading companies already have a successful blog strategy implemented for internal communication these have the additional benefit of increasing employee bonding and team building it is also an indirect platform to get your point across in a subtle way without offending anyone leading to higher motivation levels
6100652 there is already an overload of email and it does not work to send these back and forth blogs can be read at a time convenient to you and give you time to think before responding
6100653 our ceo makes use of an internal blog to update the company on a multitude of issues being confronted by the senior management highly informative topics covered include strategy major development milestones important customer news investor opinions and company policy announcements
6100654 wikis can be used quite effectively when collaboratively building an idea
6100655 we use wikis for many purposes including allocating task lists
6100656 the analysts who write our programs use wikis for their work
6100657 one of clients a large publicly listed financial services company is considering such a site for professional and not friendship purposes they want to know who their employees know not only will this be for staff but the customers and vendors they work with the latter can join only when invited by a company employee
6100658 it is a highly flexible tool where you can pick from pre coded services to custom developed ones examples of the latter include birthday reminders sending in stationery requests seeking approvals for leave or even changing the look and feel it integrates easily with your office suite leading to powerful document management collaborative work and serving as a repository of all company policies and information
6100659 all these tools allow for lateral and bottom up communication not just top down but companies are still not comfortable with open conversations like these they have very low tolerance levels for even minimal instances of the wrong message going out
6100660 managements have to develop a mindset which says they are just providing a platform they cannot control nor be responsible for everything exchanged on these as long as some basic rules are adhered to there should not be a problem having said that it is just a matter of a few years before such forms of internal communications becomes the norm
6100661 we are thrilled to be partnering with bell as part of our ongoing evolution as an entertainment retail destination
6100662 as part of that evolution we believe that mobile media and mobile devices will play an ever increasing role in the lives of our customers

6100671 britains national interests dont always overlap with those of the us but with totalitarian china on the rise and an expansionist russia flexing its military muscles it is a timely reminder that a world led by america is infinitely preferable to one led by either beijing or moscow as for those who imagine that somehow the eu can offer a rival

6100675 youd have to talk to every one of the 10 072 election jurisdictions across the country
6100676 after 2000 everyone thought you could throw a bunch of money at the problem and make it go away right away elections aint that kind of thing
6100677 there has been no evidence of any tampering on these machines
6100678 i think were the only county in the country that has that contract stipulation
6100679 i have a huge inventory of machines that i am not able to use
6100680 who wants to buy a system that has been decertified especially when other states are following suit
6100681 but the fact that obamas people made this suggestion means they know mccain outperformed him
6100682 that depends on too many variables to give a meaningful answer rich in manhattan isnt the same as rich in big stone gap virginia
6100683 if i actually take a position on this im going to make some people angry so im going to go with an answer that sounds witty and poignant but lacks a single iota of substance
6100684 members of the media are squeamish covering stuff like this so they let it go
6100685 back in 92 when people use naughty words reporters dont know as much what to do with it
6100686 no reporter has ever come out to say its not true so therefore you cant prove its not until it happens im going to refer to you as gay whenever i can score a point by doing so
6100687 i will no longer support those who ruined my country by hijacking my religion i will no longer buy into the delusions of man or government i will live my life for myself and not a man made institution like religion or politics
6100688 evangelical christian who is a member of the republican party
6100689 mccain basically voiced positions he has held for years on the issues he was questioned about confirmed by his record in the senate
6100690 also if the democrats hadnt blocked lifting the ban on off shore drilling 7 years ago when bush first tried to get them to do so then we would be seeing that oil now and it would be helping to lower gas prices
6100691 because if we can simply choose to refuse to admit that certain documents and or events are legitimate then
6100692 but let us just assume for the sake of argument that it had been obama that had done what mccain is being accused of and it could be proven it wouldnt even have been mentioned and you all know it
6100693 its a totally bogus issue its challenging the integrity of the secret service challenging the integrity of my security staff and challenging the integrity of john mccain of which both barack and john agreed to the terms right up front theres no way he could have heard the questions the fact is that john mccain did get there a little late and the truth is i actually got to tell barack obama about one of the questions in advance that i didnt get to tell john mccain about because he wasnt there i intended to tell both of them about my challenge to ask for a commitment regarding orphans and because john hadnt arrived when we went on stage he you know he didnt get to hear that question so actually it was barack who got a question answered in advance and john mccain did not
6100694 can play this game for as long as he wants but the end is becoming visible
6100695 what did you think hes a businessman and hes back in the only business he knows

6100698 faith hope and pride are permanent residents in our state
6100699 i believe the best is yet to come but it will take leadership that will address the challenges facing our state
6100700 one of the biggest challenges facing this state on nov 4 is the need to vote john cornyn out of the senate
6100701 we as texans expect a lot from our senators we expect them to provide vision and leadership to reach our potential cornyn has voted against texas families and we deserve better
6100702 but we need to pay teachers like the professionals they are we need to get out of the way and let them teach instead of focusing on one test a year
6100703 there is nothing more powerful than the will of the people of the state of texas
6100704 its time for someone to be in office who will represent that will and those people
6100705 his achievement came at a time when south africans had given up hope of getting a medal at these olympics
6100706 although she did not win a medal her courage and participation at these olympics will go down in history as one of the highlights of the beijing olympics and will go a long way towards motivating youth in south africa and the world never to give up their dreams
6100707 although they have not yet met the expectations of many south africans with regard to winning medals it is worth noting that many of them improved their own personal performances
6100708 the government and people of south africa and the entire sadc southern african development community region are deeply saddened to learn of the untimely death of our brother and leader and recent chairperson of sadc president levy mwanawasa
6100709 we extend our heartfelt condolences to the government and people of zambia and to his widow maureen mwanawasa and the children
6100710 this protocol calls for far reaching changes in the sadc countries including the repeal of all discriminatory laws the inclusion of gender equality and equity in national constitutions and the adoption of the goal of 50 percent representation of women in political and decision making structures in sadc countries by 2015
6100711 the next step is for all sadc countries to develop national plans of action to implement the protocol
6100712 the extraordinary summit resolved to call upon all the parties in zimbabwe to form an inclusive government and urged them to also commit to the dialogue aimed at implementing the sadc and african union resolutions
6100713 he was called upon to continue with the mediation efforts
6100714 aapam sa will ensure appropriate communication between the practitioners and academics within south africa as well as with the national chapters dispersed throughout africa
6100715 the anti rape strategy addresses issues after the rape has occurred and it must focus more on preventative strategy there is also a need for research to identify what is not known regarding rape patterns including political commitment and research mobilisation
6100716 communities must work hand in hand with government to ensure a better life for all women are the key to fight poverty in our communities our people have a right to live in decent houses

6100729 we cant have strong enforcement of our clean air laws unless we know what polluters are putting into the air
6100730 the bush epa went out of its way to overturn a system that required states to adequately monitor air pollution at power plants and factories instead epa actually outlawed states from requiring monitoring good enough to protect the health of their citizens epas consistent polluter biased practices have amounted to industry foxes having a house party in the henhouse
6100731 today the court slapped down epas see no evil approach to the clean air act which would have eliminated emissions monitoring required by law responding to an outstanding argument by earthjustice the court understood that emission standards that arent monitored can never be enforced todays opinion is only the latest in series of decisions that have thoroughly rejected epas seven year campaign to unravel the clean air act
6100732 the federal appeals court held that communities across america have the right to know the amount of air pollution discharged by thousands of industrial sources
6100733 the court reinstated bedrock public health protections undermined by what it properly called an epa about face and sharply admonished the agency to carry out the nations clean air laws
6100734 public health should be a top priority not polluters profits
6100735 todays decision will give states back the tools they need to hold polluters accountable and help ensure that everyone has clean healthy air to breathe
6100736 my humanity is bound up in yours for we can only be human together

6100738 competing views are a sign of subsistence farmers becoming active citizens of women speaking up
6100739 we do not know whether other areas of the investigations might lead to fines penalties operating restrictions or disqualifications or other material adverse impaction on the company or the companys previously issued financial statements
6100740 indeed tronics designs look like dreams of the future as the digital design world redefines itself frequently crossing over with architecture and other disciplines seppi and rosenthals unique background lends them a particularly valuable niche
6100741 we stay focused by developing a concept early on in the process that drives the artistic trajectory of the project we continually make sure that the idea doesnt veer too far from the original concept so that we dont lose track of the original goal of the project its a constant dialogue between our conceptual vision for the project the artistic manifestation of that vision and the desires of our clients
6100742 but this can become a positive experience by opening a dialogue between the designers and the client
6100743 often we are able to explain why we want to do something a certain way so that we end up seeing eye to eye with the client once they fully understand our reasoning behind a decision but sometimes we do need to change the look of a piece and find a creative solution that works with the new direction
6100744 it was critical in being able to define our artistic sensibility
6100745 any way you slice it pizza pis vegan pizza offers all of the flavor but none of the cholesterol and cruelty that come with meat and cheese
6100746 pizza pi is a great example of the growing number of restaurants meeting americas hunger for healthy and humane cuisine

6100749 we didnt see much of a change in the third quarter from the second quarter
6100750 this time the company got a little help from the weak dollar
6100751 the company had strong tailwinds in europe and the asia pacific region
6100752 impressive in light of concerns that a stronger u s dollar would be negative for its international business
6100753 the company remains well positioned long term given its leadership in pc notebooks and emerging markets
6100754 one of the rally s organizers recalls one of my best friends went on three tours to the middle east and died last year his mom told me that when she told him she saw my pro troops activism on a denver nine news story he burst into tears while serving in iraq our troops need to know that the american public and our representatives in washington have the resolve to see their missions completed public demonstrations of support on the home front boost the troops morale
6100755 if you hamper the war effort of one side you automatically help out that of the other pacifism is objectively pro fascist this is elementary common sense
6100756 im only 21 and i know that i still have a lot to learn
6100757 bottom line ministries that matter congregational stewardship with energy efficiency and clean energy technologies

6100765 als orie wordt teruggetrokken zal dat door de publieke opinie worden gezien als 1 0 voor karadzic
6100766 het is voor het joegoslavi tribunaal wel goed dat karadzic nu al met zijn klacht komt
6100767 als hij dat later had gedaan als het proces al enige tijd op gang was zou het tot veel grotere problemen hebben geleid dan had mogelijk met een nieuwe rechter alles overgedaan moeten worden
6100768 i am not worried you have to give them time he is 19 years old

6100771 i believe that when everyone is sharp we will have much more invention
6100772 we have had meetings to try to get it into our heads that every game is a cup final with england
6100773 there are no friendlies we have got to go out there and play well win the game and take that into the qualifiers
6100774 wouldnt god and jesus want us to work together and understand the laws we live under
6100775 i scored the first goal of my season during this trip to twente for sure its intense pleasure but the most important thing was first of all winning this game
6100776 we expected a tough game and suffered during the first half because they put us under pressure
6100777 i would never blame individuals for the team not lifting a trophy
6100778 we are in it together we win as a team and we lose as a team
6100779 as individuals we all make mistakes and the message i was relaying to a czech newspaper was that we are more experienced now and have learnt from last season
6100780 arsene has been looking for experienced cover for gael clichy and he knows all about mikael
6100781 our experience tells us that young people rarely attend safety events such as open days
6100782 this campaign aims to take road safety education right to the places where they are already gathered for example car parks schools and night spots

6100785 esa es una gran laguna en lo jur dico se debe analizar en cada caso en particular al final el que tiene la ltima palabra es el juez
6100786 en lugares como jujuy salta y santiago del estero regiones situadas en el norte argentino se consume coca inclusive m s que en bolivia a mucha gente no s lo los campesinos tambi n los banqueros gente de la alta sociedad se la ve acullicando la hoja
6100787 nosotros tenemos informaci n de que en el lado argentino hay mucha gente que consume coca son nuestros paisanos por lo tanto tambi n hay gente que se dedica a transportar la coca de forma ilegal vale decir camufl ndola
6100788 lo hacen en peque as cantidades pueden ser dos tres hasta cinco libras y la llevan alrededor del cuerpo
6100789 utilizan el mismo modus operandi que con la coca na y lo hacen por el precio pues aqu cuesta 20 bolivianos y all entre 80 y 100 bolivianos
6100790 hay gente que consume hay detallistas que llevan del mercado a las zonas fronterizas principalmente a villaz n tupiza y yacuiba en ese sector consumen la hoja de coca
6100791 el acto del coqueo est considerado como un acto de intoxicaci n seg n su art culo 26 de la norma

6100796 the thunderdragon consistently provides an interesting and enjoyable read always entertaining and often insightful his writing may even give us a foretaste of our political future stick with him after all time will cure his youth

6100798 vrouwen komen vaak met een partner of kind die als tolk functioneert
6100799 mensen eten wanneer ze trek hebben en gebruiken veel calorierijke tussendoortjes zij hebben weinig inzicht in hun ziektebeeld

6100803 we have to get behind him because he is a tremendous force and is of tremendous importance for the team
6100804 what happened in the transfer period did not always reflect his deep desire and there was manipulation from agents on both sides
6100805 hey we were told 90 days well go with that and deal with it in 90 days

6100886 sids is the leading cause of post neonatal infant mortality in north america occurs at twice the national average rate in alaska and three times that rate in alaska natives
6100887 the work that i do tests a leading theory which suggests that infants are made vulnerable to sids in part through brainstem abnormalities
6100888 cardiac arrest and stroke are the leading causes of adult disability and alaskas arctic ground squirrel may lead to improved therapies for patients

6100890 this conference creates a platform for young investigators both faculty and students from small research universities to network and collaborate with other scientists and to show their skills to national institutes of health officials
6100891 when i first read about this i couldnt believe it was legal
6100892 no law would ever prevent a man like this from getting a gun
6100893 one thing that has always bothered me about the california wine industry
6100894 nationally local governments have been struggling with soaring health care costs for many years
6100895 the awareness of the new liability and the requirement to disclose it has created heightened concerns regarding the affordability of public sector health care
6100896 fewer than 30 percent of the respondents have made changes to co pays or deductibles in the last two years
6100897 fewer than 20 percent have implemented options such as joining purchasing coalitions or educating employees and retirees on making smart health purchasing decisions
6100898 right to the free exercise of religion does not exempt defendant physicians here from conforming their conduct to the anti discrimination requirements
6100899 i am not so certain this balance of competing interests would product the same result in the case of a sole practitioner
6100900 clear and emphatic that discrimination has no place in doctors offices
6100901 because it addresses a common misperception that many health care practitioners do seem to believe that there is a religious freedom to pick and choose among patients notwithstanding a law requiring that all patients be treated equally
6100902 desire to promote the homosexual lifestyle at the risk of infringing upon the first amendment right to free exercise of religion is what the public needs to learn about
6100903 chi ha fede muove le montagne chi ha fede fa proseliti chi ha fede vince le battaglie
6100904 the main difference is going to be that we are really designing outside of the box i mean quite literally this time on season 1 they were designing inside these white boxes and this time weve taken our kids out into real places and real settings so you have real professionals designing in real places and i think thats going to make it much more exciting
6100905 im so thrilled that todds still on board because you have to see the way he is with the contestants
6100906 i was able to flip flop the hats pretty easily but this was the no homework job
6100907 it was really fun just to get to show up and be very present i wasnt learning lines on this season it was really fun and organic i love being in the moment and reacting and sort of responding to the energy from the contestants because i wouldnt say theyre in panic mode but theyre about as revved up as they can get and its a very exciting time to watch creativity bloom like that
6100908 i would hear the kids saying todds just come in and the reverence in their voices is overwhelming
6100909 and obviously it made such a difference to them it is testing them and obviously its a competitive tv show but it really is grueling and testing for these contestants and i think to have todd there giving them the pat on the back from a true true professional who is so highly recognized in america it made the world of difference
6100910 he suddenly came through with the call are you interested in doing a tv show and i took rather a deep breath and thought gosh that is a new departure for me ive been on shows but ive never hosted a show
6100911 they said well youll have to go to l a for a screen test and it sounded incredibly romantic going to l a for a screen test but it wasnt romantic at all i did an hour live as a guest of larry king and i think if you can survive an hour live with larry king you could probably survive hosting top design and i have to say ive had a brilliant year thanks to that ive made a lot of friends and it was really something that i felt very natural doing and i enjoyed immensely
6100912 i think one of the reasons the shows work is because magical elves are really lovely people theyre really something
6100913 i think the effort always shows on the outside so i think that may be one of the reasons that people like watching them theyre good people doing good stuff
6100914 remarkable show the only show on tv i know thats actually harder than it looks on tv
6100915 ill tell you whats interesting about the contestants that we have on this show is that theres such a wide variation and background we have some very very highly trained professionals which obviously brings a very different edge to the show
6100916 i think that its interesting to see that the collaboration really stimulates the imagination in this instance and that youve got the 20 year old whos just come out of school really fresh new look at the world and then youve got the very experienced set designer whos been on the game for some time
6100917 i think its a very good balance that they have there
6100918 margaret is extremely authoritative with reason she has a great deal of knowledge jonathan is out there in the field as is kelly and so they know and they have both worked their way up to the position theyre in now so they know what it takes so that they are in a position to be able to sit there and criticize may be too strong a word but certainly give their point of view so i think it makes for very good watching these are real professionals judging and i think that makes a big difference
6100919 i think with the economic downturn that were going to be seeing people are going to be spending much more time in their homes
6100920 theyre going to be cutting back on the restaurants holidays and nights out and i think we want those places to be stylish warm and inviting

6100924 this is a really exciting project for castrol the original concept for the ringtone competition was to bring younger users into the castrol brand but we never imagined that wed end up producing a single for chart release
6100925 were thrilled that weve been able to have the chance to use our iconic theme tune once more and introduce it to the next generation of car owners
6100926 ive been producing my own music for a number of years now but this is the first time that ive had the chance to make it into the charts the mahler tune is a real classic and it was great to have the challenge to remix it into something fresh and modern
6100927 we are an chinese company but we do business all over the world and most of our customers are from american and canada
6100928 we expected and intended to have no impact whatsoever on the direction of prices thats not the purpose of regulations
6100929 we store them very very carefully in the hopes that someone someday may decide that we can use them again
6100930 youd have to talk to every one of the 10 072 election jurisdictions across the country
6100931 after 2000 everyone thought you could throw a bunch of money at the problem and make it go away right away elections aint that kind of thing
6100932 there has been no evidence of any tampering on these machines

6100936 by going to invesco field at mile high we doubled the number of boxes and that has helped dramatically that and having the candidate have been a big difference
6100937 the fact is john is not the man jen thought he was
6100938 once again she feels she has been mislead by a man she cared deeply about only to be left disappointed
6100939 jen and john made a pact not to go public about their relationship when they were together and now they are apart he has gone and shot his mouth off at the first opportunity
6100940 im the healthiest ive been all my lifemagazine my diet has a lot to do with my getting into shape i have no sugar i dont eat fruit or even fruit juice because of the sugar
6100941 i eat chicken and salmon and rice i eat avocados ill have egg whites for breakfast and sometimes turkey burgers for lunch
6100942 i try to do just 1 200 calories a day it may sound like its not much but its actually a lot of food if you eat the right things
6100943 i get mad if the maid does all the housework if she takes it all into her own hands well whats for me to do im a cleaning fanatic dusting is my favorite and windex ing
6100944 usually the maid and i will cook together sons sean and jayden love my spaghetti
6100945 the rebound ti was expecting in late 2009 or early 2010 will not occur
6100946 when the sides parted some unions were outside the pay deal and it was accepted they were entitled to lodge claims
6100947 the baseline increase we are seeking is 10 per cent over two years in order to inflation proof our members basic pay against expected cost of living increases of around 5 per cent a year over that period
6100948 i want to welcome you to a world where anything can happen
6100949 we came from a situation where we produced 5 000 kg of corn by hectare while today it is 10 to 12 000 kg per hectare of corn
6100950 we have more chinese people eating we have more indians eating we have more africans eating and we have a lot more brazilians eating
6100951 all this which is treated by the press as if it were a crisis and is sold to the world as if it were a crisis
6100952 without any arrogance or self importance we brazilians need to confront what for others is a crisis as an extraordinary opportunity to truly transform ourselves into the granary of the world as many people have long predicted
6100953 without any doubt there is potential to produce if the government doesnt get in the way
6100954 we are not even going to say help if they dont get in the way a lot year by year the producer is generally increasing production
6100955 if you talk about central brazil there are still a lot of areas to be exploited so i dont have much doubt
6100956 what we have seen in the last 10 years is a quiet revolution happening in our country mostly in agribusiness production
6100957 we came from being an irrelevant international market participant to be one of the worlds major food and biofuel suppliers today
6100958 so if you look at what happened to our agriculture in terms of beef exports poultry exports again we were irrelevant and now we have the position of largest exporter in the world in major food crops
6100959 the impact will start to emerge with more intensity within 20 to 30 years and until then we should be preparing for this
6100960 the perspective for the moment for future harvests is highly productive so brazil has the potential to continue growing around 5 to 6 a year in terms of increasing harvests we are going to effectively maintain this rhythm in the coming years without any problem
6100961 we are not against expanding the brazilian capacity for producing food and helping brazil to develop this country
6100962 you can increase the food capacity through technology through better practices through occupying areas that are already degraded to investing in better crops
6100963 but you can not increase your productivity at the expense of the environment because the global market doesnt accept this price any more
6100964 if we have the right investments coming on for logistics for infrastructure and for technology and land development the country can multiply by two and a half three times the actual production in the next 10 years
6100965 of course we have increases that could come from europe from the usa from canada from argentina
6100966 but where you see the best conditions in order to give the world society the best rate of return in terms of investment is in brazil
6100967 if you talk about the next five years we are now producing 130 million tonnes of grains we can easily go to 250 million tonnes
6100968 we are now producing seven million hectares of sugar cane this can go to 20 million hectares helping to supply ethanol to the world we are only exporting 400m of fruits we can go to 3bn of fruits
6100969 next up is africa i think for africa this could be a redemption in terms of inclusion of people in production systems and making africa produce food and biofuels for the world
6100970 world demand for food today is one billion tonnes and brazil produces 150 million tonnes
6100971 brazil produces 150 million tonnes and the plan launched by the government for more food will produce six million more which is going to leave one million for export how is brazil going to be the granary of food production
6100972 boy im glad i climbed that corporate ladder until i was old enough to retire
6100973 man i should have done blank while i had the chance
6100974 twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didnt do than by the ones you did do so throw off the bowlines sail away from the safe harbor catch the trade winds in your sails

6100978 after almost two years these sites have still not been decontaminated and continue to threaten the lives and health of tens of thousands of residents across different social spectrums in abidjan
6100979 the government has informed me that it does not have the technical capacity to clean up and decontaminate the dumpsites in a timelier manner
6100980 this is to send a signal to other trans national corporations and individuals that such crimes will not go unpunished and that africa is not a cheap dumping ground

6100984 training entering and underwriting the full expenses for the u s teams in the olympic paralympic pan american and parapan american games
6100985 theres still some perception in the public that we either receive government funding we dont or that sponsors pay for the funding of our olympic team and they dont have to contribute to it its a matter of getting our message out there
6100986 while were not crying poverty in terms of our funding compared to other olympic committees around the world were probably not in the top 10
6100987 obviously our brand is incredibly strong and were pleased with that wed like to see private donor fundraising a little higher
6100988 in the past it wasnt as strong as it should have been because we werent as organized to do it as we should have been we had some dislocation and change with the government reform process that slowed it down

6100992 it was very brief we spoke for just a few minutes it was like meeting a complete stranger
6100993 regardless of the parties there is a certain political intercourse that is thrown in with other broader benefits of future access and gratitude when you become a financier of the conventions
6100994 while we recognize that the steps we have taken are not perfect or even a perfect symbol they do reflect the fact that barack obama shares the urgent desire of the american people to change the way washington operates
6100995 the idea is to give our leadership a chance to be with these folks to talk about our issues and make sure that our issues are out there
6100996 you can have a cover band but you cant have a name act
6100997 you can have a string quartet but were not sure you can have a dj
6100998 not in terms of eliminating the parties and receptions that surround the conventions but in terms of curbing the real influence buying events that involved lobbyists and lobbying organizations spending six figure amounts for parties that really were parties thrown by the members themselves

6101019 epa should be evaluating the risks to bees before approving new pesticides but now refuses to tell the public what it knows
6101020 pesticide restrictions might be at the heart of the solution to this growing crisis so why hide the information they should be using to make those decisions
6101021 there is conflicting information about the affects of neonicotinoids on honey bees and different chemicals in this class are known to vary in their toxicity to bees however the epa identifies both imidacloprid and clothianidin as highly toxic to honey bees
6101022 their uses include seed treatments for corn cotton canola and sunflowers foliar sprays of fruit nut and coffee crops granular and liquid drench applications in turf ornamentals fruit crops and in forests
6101023 it has the potential for toxic chronic exposure to honey bees as well as other non target pollinators through the translocation of clothianidin resides in nectar and pollen in honey bees the affects of this toxic chronic exposure may include lethal and or sub lethal effects in the larvae and reproductive effects on the queen
6101024 there is concern about the practice of combining certain insecticides and fungicides
6101025 we do not know that these chemicals have anything to do with colony collapse disorder but they are definitely stressors in the home and in the food sources
6101026 pesticides alone have not shown they are the cause of ccd we believe that it is a combination of a variety of factors possibly including mites viruses and pesticides
6101027 epa needs to help shed some light so that researchers can get to work on this problem this isnt just an issue for farmers this is an issue that concerns us all

6101045 what obama is creating is this army of individuals these grass roots activists who are out there trying to change the world in 160 characters or less
6101046 regardless of the parties there is a certain political intercourse that is thrown in with other broader benefits of future access and gratitude when you become a financier of the conventions
6101047 while we recognize that the steps we have taken are not perfect or even a perfect symbol they do reflect the fact that barack obama shares the urgent desire of the american people to change the way washington operates
6101048 the idea is to give our leadership a chance to be with these folks to talk about our issues and make sure that our issues are out there
6101049 you can have a cover band but you cant have a name act
6101050 you can have a string quartet but were not sure you can have a dj

6101052 positive role during the political developments of the last few days that led to the resignation of musharraf
6101053 their median age is about 20 years younger than our median age
6101054 so i dont think we can party as hard as they are now but 20 years ago we could
6101055 the unit plans to integrate some of our content delivery services into a single service
6101056 we have made great progress with the initial offering this year and i see great potential going forward as we bring context aware internet services to peoples pockets
6101057 people would not know my father till 1996 when leander paes bagged the individual bronze medal in athens press wrote about my father and people came to know that it was khashaba jadhav who had bagged india the first individual medal he lived in a world of obscurity and penury
6101058 his feat is unparallaled just for the fact that he had to face so many hurdles the environment that time was very different india was trying to stand in its feet having just gained independence five years back there was no encouragement for a sportsperson
6101059 it was decided to facilitate discussions with one and all groups or parties which were protesting during the three hour meeting
6101060 non compliance would be a violation of the foreign exchange management act 1999
6101061 this particular storyline was chosen because children are always eager for adventures and it allows for a lot of audience interaction and participation
6101062 however we will take legal advice and look into demands made by the farmers for more compensation earlier if there are provisions to give more compensation it will be handed over to the farmers
6101063 we are in constant touch with the assam government and keeping a close watch on the situation we will provide additional forces if the situation worsens
6101064 i believe that our value proposition will continue to attract more members as well as to deliver increased frequency
6101065 because the majority of bjs sales are derived from non discretionary items we have been able to generate strong top line growth in a challenging macro environment
6101066 doing the same thing repeatedly once you know the results
6101067 why doesnt executive mgmt take research into account when making decisions
6101068 i was in my 20s and a hothead i caused such a stink in the office of a rental car agency that i was blackballed throughout their whole agency i couldnt believe it as a customer it made me feel as though they had power over me and it made me angry and uncomfortable i was young and probably wrong but i was still upset regarding that treatment
6101069 the only reasons we would fire a customer explicitly as opposed to an indirect method would be if there was inappropriate behavior with one of our employees like profanity threatening behavior innuendo or something really egregious which has never happened or if we found someone tampering with our system by perhaps trying to sneak into someone elses data that would require legal action in cases like those or any time youre considering firing a worth speaking with your attorney before taking any action just to be sure you understand what youre liable for in terms of ongoing product or service delivery and other separation issues
6101070 you can offer concrete proof that this customer based on service needs or other factors simply costs more to satisfy than your current levels of service or production offer companies lose clients due to price all the time and that customer leaves with no hard just the cost of doing business
6101071 you might use throttling a technique by which you take a bit longer to respond to the client to reduce service levels look at netflix as an example they basically offer an all you can eat scenario giving you as many dvds you want and their profit is based on volume in membership if youre constantly turning them around it means more postal expenses for netflix so theyve created a priority system where heavier users are served more slowly is that unreasonable its gotten a lot of buzz in the blogosphere but the court of public opinion seems to think its o k it hasnt negatively impacted their business
6101072 having that shared investment should give you hope that theres the potential to improve a relationship instead of terminating one
6101073 and its certainly easier not to mention less expensive to continue a relationship than it would be to start a new one it might just be a matter of leveling with the customer letting them know that theyre important and youd like to figure out a way to make it work if you havent yet made the effort straight communication may help and can even set you up for a better long term relationship
6101074 important investment in the dynamic brazilian market and ensures that our iron ore base is further diversified in the face of tighter supply for raw materials
6101075 this is evident from a large number of factors including its lack of responsiveness to the needs of its airline customers and a lack of initiative in planning capacity
6101076 this has resulted in investment that is not tailored to the requirements of airport users and lower levels and quality of service for both airlines and passengers
6101077 monopolies clearly dont work and the baa monopoly has done huge damage to competition and the traveling public and it is high time it was broken up
6101078 this is not the end of the competition commission process
6101079 we will continue to point out to the commission the many areas where we believe its analysis is flawed and its remedies would be disproportionate and counterproductive
6101080 we would also expect the uncertainty of changes toughening to the regulatory model would weigh down on potential value
6101081 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything
6101082 they dont have insight on how bad losses are going to get
6101083 a virginia man found guilty of illegally possessing a gun is the first person exonerated by a 2004 state law that allows convicts to try to prove their innocence by presenting new non dna evidence to a court
6101084 i consider it a victory because it does show that the process works
6101085 i hope it does not take a concession of error every time for a writ to be successful
6101086 while serving in the virginia general assembly the attorney general supported the legislation that created the current writ of actual innocence
6101087 the courts decision today demonstrates that the criminal justice system works
6101088 somehow the little country boy grew up to rattle chains
6101089 people were probably saying to themselves here is memphis the buckle on the bible belt and isaac hayes is coming out onstage dressed as black moses
6101090 if you notice that album opened out with flaps kind of like a crucifix that was seen as pretty heavy for those times and that was the mystique about him wearing those chains
6101091 the first few shows i did with him he didnt wear the chains
6101092 but then he started wearing them and i think it represented to him the coming freedom of the black man
6101093 his music represented an identity of what it meant to be black
6101094 it was exciting in a kind of strength of course it all coincided with the civil rights movement and for a musician his was a different image coming out there onstage with no shirt and those chains man it was a whole other world
6101095 i remember we had been on the road and he came offstage and people were howling and grabbing for him and one of the musicians said man you are the black moses people will follow you anywhere it was really radical
6101096 so everything you hear on his albums he had hummed to himself first
6101097 and i dont know if people quite realized what he really did
6101098 das wird eine autonome entscheidung des bdv sein da wird sich die politik nicht einmischen
6101099 um diese stiftung zu gr nden es soll eine unselbstst ndige stiftung sein unter dem dach des deutschen historischen museums muss die organisatorische struktur des deutschen historischen museums ver ndert werden
6101100 after weeks of maneuvering aimed at producing a display of unity when democrats gather in denver later this month sen
6101101 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
6101102 the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests
6101103 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
6101104 the best way i think to do that is to have a strategy so that my delegates feel like theyve had a role and that their legitimacy has been validated
6101105 its as old as greek drama theres a catharsis everybody comes and they want to yell and scream and have their opportunity and i think thats all to the good
6101106 i think what we are looking for is energy and excitement about the prospects of changing this country and i think that people who supported a whole range of different candidates during the primaries are going to come out of that convention feeling absolutely determined that we have to take the white house back
6101107 when you think about how we make decisions for cars and mortgages and how we eliminate options based on cost thats not necessarily the case for college
6101108 at some point if its going to totally put a familys finances in jeopardy rationality needs to factor in
6101109 today the days of being cut off from the rest of the world while in the air become history
6101110 la manera en que vamos a trabajar el tema de la controversia
6101111 tendremos que defender lo que votamos es un tema en el que vamos a una controversia contra el ejecutivo que es un gobernador emanado de las filas de acci n nacional

6101117 sobre presupuesto y parece que hay una opini n de la corte que es una acci n aut noma del legislativo y que no procede pero en cuanto al camino que eligi s era sa la v a
6101118 es muy probable que los tiempos no le alcancen para resolver porque no podr hacerlo ya en el proceso electoral
6101119 acci n populista que no combate la pobreza ni la marginaci n yo preferir a que se construyera una escuela con esos diez millones de pesos y eso s abatir a el rezago y la marginaci n porque una escuela ser a para siempre en su comunidad mientras que las bicicletas son para unos cuantos y por un tiempo corto
6101120 decir que estamos bien porque estamos como est todo el pa s andamos mal en resultados la prueba nos dio malos resultados y eso debe ser motivo para que el estado implemente acciones para apoyar la educaci n
6101121 the cost of capital of this nature is just staggering

6101130 when julie peterson decided to have a baby on her own two years ago she picked a tall blond blue eyed danish engineer as a sperm donor to match her own scandinavian heritage
6101131 i was in complete shock i hadnt thought about anything but having another baby with this donor it was just so surprising and bewildering
6101132 id love to give him a full sibling but i just couldnt do it its so unfortunate
6101133 in addition to being tall and well educated their motivations for donation are quite sincere they want to help childless couples they tended to sell out very fast
6101134 theres a huge demand and the fda is essentially saying to these patients they cant choose the characteristics of the children they want even though there is absolutely no scientific evidence on their side
6101135 they say the risk is theoretically possible but the risk is too small and too insignificant to even be described
6101136 i think most people would tell you they want this to be as safe as possible both for themselves and their offspring and theyd want to eliminate any possible risk
6101137 i did a review of the world literature and we could not find any support for it theres no record of any transmission this way its restricted because the fda made an administrative decision to regulate all tissues on the same standards
6101138 you can never say never but it seems like a very remote possibility
6101139 there are a lot of people in the field who would question the utility of the regulation as it now stands
6101140 im swedish norwegian and really wanted to have a gene pool that was similar to my own
6101141 i wanted a baby that looked like me and wanted to share my heritage with my baby now i have a beautiful viking baby which is what i wanted i was hoping to give her a full sibling
6101142 its a huge commitment both financially and with my time
6101143 surgeons in denver are publishing their first account of a procedure in which they remove the hearts of severely brain damaged newborns less than two minutes after the babies are disconnected from life support and their hearts stop beating so the organs can be transplanted into infants who would otherwise die
6101144 this bold experiment is pushing the boundaries and raising many questions
6101145 were trying to deal with a very difficult situation where children die waiting for transplant and parents of other children want to donate
6101146 in a very important way its a wonderful story you had three situations with hopeless medical problems who would have otherwise died but got this gift of life
6101147 the donors are not dead i understand that they would like us to change the definition of death but they cant do that by themselves its very problematic to start treating a baby as an organ donor before its dead
6101148 the whole issue is whether the infants from whom the hearts were taken were dead it seems very clear to me that they were not
6101149 i think its illegal and if its illegal what were talking about is the physicians causing the death of the three patients and that would be homicide its immoral i think it should be stopped
6101150 at the end of the day we feel we are on very firm ground
6101151 there is no question these all met the criteria that one would establish for death
6101152 its a much cleaner way to go and avoids all of the crazy stuff that were talking about here in terms of how do we diagnose death
6101153 the whole area of organ donation relies on the public trusting physicians in that they believe they wont murder them or commit homicide they wont hasten their deaths
6101154 it would be unfair to parents who are interested in donating and to the patients who would otherwise die if we stopped
6101155 it hit mark gruntz all at once while he was sitting flat broke in an airport in greece he had lost credit for three summer courses wasted 11 474 in student loans and gotten kicked off a boat all because he hadnt cited wikipedia enough in a paper about a movie
6101156 when you graduate from u va it means a little more because of the honor system and i would argue thats the same for someone taking classes
6101157 the honor system is defined by the philosophy and the spirit of integrity that we want to uphold here at the university of virginia
6101158 we want to be as clear as possible about what is and isnt acceptable
6101159 it is hard to remember what your thoughts are and what was from wikipedia
6101160 i got in trouble for not citing it enough i guess
6101161 i think i was supposed to put quotations around it
6101162 i tell my students wikipedia is not a good source i would prefer you dont use it that said if you do cite it like you would any book or journal
6101163 it was like a kangaroo court i just felt like i was being hammered i had no hope
6101164 it was basically five on one and then mark was not allowed to have any counsel or any time to prepare for the trial even though he was told that he would have that
6101165 my paper was no different than marks and i received nothing but a slap on the wrist instead of getting a b i got a c
6101166 with completely different attitudes at our schools to expect us to just pick up the honor code like that is ridiculous
6101167 los parlamentarios quedamos sorprendidos con el tiempo que debe esperar un venezolano para comprar un carro por esta v a porque hay personas que tienen hasta cuatro a os pagando y no le han entregado el veh culo
6101168 ellos tienen que ofrecerles una respuesta ya sea la entrega del dinero o del veh culo
6101169 no puede ser que una ciudadana o ciudadano que haya aportado dinero tenga que esperar seis a os para que le sea devuelto su aporte estas cosas son las que nos sorprenden y por ello debemos actuar porque est n afectando a venezolanos de bajos recursos

6101171 what is it that makes a great track mood arrangement beats the message this has it all the intro evolves from a combination of pads vocals and a deep electronic bass a landscape of dark house with a touch of dub spreads it out the vocals add a glimmer of hope to this landscape and the experience is absolutely beautiful

6101183 you have been operating in a pristine world your patients are completely untouched and uncontaminated by psychology they have never been asked about deep emotions in school they were not asked to write about feelings no one has suggested to women for years that their ailments might be psychosomatic in fact no one in vienna in 1897 even knows what that word means
6101184 hurry up for gods sake i havent all day you know
6101185 ive an hours worth of business at the american consulate
6101186 i mean hes not first sighting recognizable like ringo starr say or robert redford or mick jagger oh no but definitely in the second tier after walking fifty yards in new york or san francisco or atlanta you can bet that someone is going to come up and shake his hand and ask for an autograph or ask about woodstock or whether shadow self will stay together
6101187 it gets damned annoying you know especially when one is trying to have a serious conversation about the future and he doesnt do anything to prevent it its that damned wild bill hickok look

6101202 mr bush jesus demands in the sermon on the mount that his followers turn the other cheek how will that teaching guide your conduct of american foreign policy especially in the event of say an attack on the united states

6101241 perhaps the finest hour in the history of the new york city department
6101242 you have to wonder what the new york city police department is trying to hide
6101243 along with mayor michael bloombergs denial of permits for protests on central parks great lawn the police action helped to all but eliminate dissent from new york city during the republican delegates visit if that was the goal then mission accomplished and civil rights denied
6101244 sent helicopters to track the riders as they roll through manhattan on the last friday evening of every month they have stationed mobile command centers the kind of trailer size outposts set up after a major emergency near where the cyclists usually gather in union square

6101251 but a few years ago i asked some students if they knew what watergate was and they said that was where monica lewinsky lived

6101301 a very tough time for us as we learned about the accident the prayers of the entire university community are with kelly roggensacks parents and sisters tonight
6101302 we are now making plans for a memorial mass for kelly when all of our students return to the campus she was a sophomore and returning student and we want to give all of our students the chance to come together to grieve
6101303 the accident remains under investigation at this point we have experts coming in to assist the troopers in their investigation
6101304 i was deeply saddened to learn of kellys tragic death
6101305 the entire university family mourns her loss and is praying for the repose of her soul and for the consolation of her family and friends
6101306 she was highly thought of by everyone who knew her the cross country team members had nothing but kind words for her it is hard to measure how deep this loss is to all of us
6101307 from here we mourn together as a university and we mourn together as the city of steubenville

6101311 no matter what happened there is a gap that i have to work harder to overcome
6101312 the pace was quite slow but i did not want to take the lead because that was not part of the strategy of staying near bekele i could not stay with him in the end but this race showed me how much ground i have to make up in order to compete internationally

6101324 corn its been running anywhere from 450 to 500 an acre to put in a corn crop
6101325 so even if you get 100 to 120 bushels at 5 an acre thats really just break even and so anything above that is obviously making farmers money
6101326 it wasnt until the middle of july when they got planted and because of our cooler weather they are just kind of sitting there so we are going to have to have a late fall if they are going to make really good yields
6101327 let me take this opportunity to restate and emphasize that mr noe is not aware that any reliable resources have reported anything

6101340 my biggest problem is i absolutely love the sb 800s imo many of the added features are great but i do not think i can justify switching everything out wholesale buying just one might be a very good idea i can see many instances when those extra features would make for a more useful single flash
6101341 after some preliminary use i dont think theres any doubt get an sb 900 if youre heavy into flash and retire your sb 800 to dedicated remote wireless use
6101342 the sb 900 is a flash for full time newsmen and wedding shooters its a poor choice for general photography

6101344 a number of our apprentices go on to run their own businesses or rise to the top of their employers firm and reap the benefits of their training
6101345 this is something that should be encouraged and we applaud the government for putting apprenticeships back at the centre of the education agenda

6101352 we have been able to try new sports and we have been given opportunities to get into coaching
6101353 the kids are all at different ability levels so we have to make the activities fun for all of them
6101354 this is my second year its been great and ive made new friends
6101355 ive really liked the tennis and football ive learnt how to do a header properly
6101356 there are lots of new sports this year and we have lots of matches
6101357 the first week is about giving the coaches a wide range of skills so they have more opportunities to work with clubs and organisations in the community
6101358 its a really good opportunity for all the young people and they really enjoy it
6101359 the group have obviously worked very well together to accomplish the results demonstrated in their final presentation to acrastyle management
6101360 their implementation of 5s workplace organisation activities are now clear to see within the production department including the machine area disconnector assembly area and the drilling area
6101361 we hope that the team members will all progress to study for the nvq level 3 in bit later this year
6101362 the group should be very proud of their achievements as acrastyle has definitely improved as a direct result of their efforts well done all

6101489 he tipped us off he was working on a deal that if you want more information before the news conference to drop in the office
6101490 to me councils role begins when the feasibility study comes in
6101491 city council approved the agreement with the spits in the fall of 2006 but councillors themselves were not shown copies of the deal council endorsed it based on an administration report that was then taken away following in camera discussions
6101492 his main concern revolves around whether city administrators will be asked to play a major role during the marina canal feasibility study taking them away from their main responsibilities overseeing city operations
6101493 it makes me want to know how much time will be spent on this since it has has not come to council
6101494 it is anticipated that the feasibility study will be over a period of approximately 10 weeks
6101495 thats why we are planning a new canal and urban village development that will expand our spectacular waterfront into the downtown core

6101536 mountaineering was one of the original sports identified by baron de coubertin for inclusion when the modern olympics began in 1896 so this is a particularly fitting event to mark an exciting four years for british sport

6101538 its always a pleasure to be at the top of scafell pike as its got one of the greatest viewpoints in the country and is one of the most visited spots in the lakes
6101539 it will be a particular pleasure as well be flying the flag for britain hopefully the publicity thats generated around the olympics will encourage more and more young people to take up sport
6101540 its an exciting prospect to be flying the olympic flag and certainly gives me a clear goal to aim for in four years time its a great honour to be asked to accompany two sporting legends to the highest point in england to mark this occasion
6101541 were all setting our sights high for the 2012 games so flying the flag on the roof of england is a suitable start to our olympic journey
6101542 the decision to recommend the offer was seen by both parties sellafield ltd and prospect in the context of the various opportunities for the site and the risks of strike action in particular the lasting damage that any such action could cause in areas such as job security site investment management union relationships and stakeholder confidence these issues are particularly crucial coming at a time when we should be working together for the long term prosperity of our sites
6101543 there is always that risk if industrial action closes plants and whether or not government decided to open them again these are the sorts of concerns we have this is why we are leaning in the direction we are
6101544 questions of confidence also arise with the new sellafield parent body coming in and the community which relies heavily on sellafield there is also the energy coast masterplan anything disruptive we did might have short or longer term effects
6101545 if there was an offer we felt we could recommend to our members then we could ignore the ballot
6101546 the message is clear our members will not accept this derisory offer and they need to come with a significant improved offer
6101547 although we are balloting separately the feedback is that a two per cent offer is unacceptable with inflation at five per cent and rising
6101548 as far as we are concerned this is an improved offer we are not saying it is a good one but we will be recommending acceptance in the ballot because we believe there is nothing else to come

6101915 the behavior of russia in this most recent crisis is isolating russia from the principles of cooperation among nations of the communities of states
6101916 it is not an act of the united states or the european union or anyone else to isolate russia it is what russia is doing
6101917 we call on russia to take immediate action to withdraw its troops from the areas it is supposed to leave under the six principle agreement signed by president saakashvili and president medvedev
6101918 i would say with respect to the russian disposition that we dont see much change in the forces that were there
6101919 there can be no business as usual with russia while this kind of activity goes on
6101920 this document is a very clear statement that this alliance nato having come so far after the end of the cold war and the collapse of the soviet union in achieving a europe that is whole free and at peace is not going to permit a new line to be drawn in europe between those who were fortunate enough to make it into the transatlantic structures and those who still aspire to those transatlantic structures

6101932 we faced a hard situation when the insurgents and militias took over the neighborhoods here
6101933 we faced a lot of problems especially with the power
6101934 we discovered this was something they were lacking and not only would it bring revenue and jobs but it would also help the whole country as well
6101935 we were able to save them quite a bit so were hoping with that money they will be able to get the parts they need
6101936 theyve been running at a loss pretty much since 2003 because of low productivity but theyve been able to come through i think a lot of that money is coming from their other businesses they run or personal money
6101937 ahmed strikes me as a good guy who genuinely cares about his product and is proud of what he does

6101939 youre talking less than a point of being in the final which makes it even more difficult to take
6101940 i was nervous which is kind of typical at least for me
6101941 at the beginning of the match i was kind of tight i was probably being more careful than what i normally am i was a little bit leery of trying to shade
6101942 i wanted to shoot in a condition but it was just coming and going the condition wouldnt stay there
6101943 it wasnt until about halfway through the match that i loosened up a little bit and started to shade more often
6101944 if i had done that in the beginning i might have fared a little better but shading is kind of risky theres no science to it or formula that you can figure out its just an instinct type kind of shooting
6101945 that hurt thats just tough to take ive been training hard i think i performed pretty decently today maybe i was a little too tentative and a little too careful and i probably shouldve been shading from the very start
6101946 ill never forget the experience in 04 but this has been a great experience too
6101947 what more can you ask for than another chance to represent the united states and the u s army you cant ask for anything more than that
6101948 i love representing the united states and representing the u s army theres not a better feeling than to do that
6101949 we did all the tourist stuff then the great wall the silk market and all the shopping
6101950 this time ive been trying to stay focused we have our apartment where were all staying in the olympic village and between there the dining facility and the range thats where ive been this whole shooting complex is just a beautiful facility they really did a great job of putting it together
6101951 theres so much emotion going on right now that its a tough decision to make but this will probably be my last olympics ive been doing this for a long time now its time to do something else maybe something still within the sport of shooting a coaching job or something like that
6101952 i dont even want to say because i hate to be one of those who comes out of retirement
6101953 its tough to do especially in this sport where you can do it as long as you have the desire to compete and i still have the desire to compete i just dont know to put four years of your life into an hour and 15 minutes thats hard to do
6101954 we do a lot of family stuff but maybe its time to start focusing on them more and what they want to do in life
6101955 the youngest one loves to shoot and i want to be able to give him the time that my dad was able to give me which you have to start at a young age i think its time to give back a little not only to my own kids but to other shooters
6101956 if there is a coaching job available at the u s army marksmanship unit i will definitely apply for that position
6101957 with my military background i think it would be a good fit and there are probably a couple other opportunities that will be available when i retire
6101958 ive been with the amu off and on my whole career
6101959 ive done tours in korea for 14 months and four years in fort hood texas i also went to airborne school ranger school and all the other army officer schools
6101960 the world class athlete program is just a superb program
6101961 its just an amazing opportunity that the army provides and a lot of people dont know that opportunity exists it just exemplifies what the military is all about it wants soldiers to be successful and thats one of the ways it provides an opportunity for a soldier to be successful in something that he loves to do
6101962 if you want to be an olympic shooter in the united states basically there are two places to be the u s olympic training center in colorado springs colo or the army marksmanship unit in fort benning ga

6101968 this will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea
6101969 it is nonetheless a system that establishes firmly again and reaffirms our cooperation and relationship with poland it will deepen our defense cooperation and it will deepen our ability to deal with threats
6101970 no one can dictate to poland what it should do thats in the past our neighbors should now understand that our nation will never give in nor allow itself to be intimidated

6102217 if computer programming is to become an important part of computer research and development a transition of programming from an art to a disciplined science must be effected
6102218 first steps toward transforming the art of programming into a science
6102219 previous to the year 1780 mineralogy though tolerably understood by many as an art could scarce be deemed a science
6102220 the work of science is to substitute facts for appearances and demonstrations for impressions
6102221 the development of the photographic image is both an art and a science
6102222 the making of a dictionary is both a science and an art
6102223 the science without the art is likely to be ineffective the art without the science is certain to be inaccurate
6102224 a knowledge of the science of number is of minor importance skill in the art of reckoning is absolutely indispensible
6102225 it was once thought that the imaginative outlook of the artist was death for the scientist and the logic of science seemed to spell doom to all possible artistic flights of fancy
6102226 i dont know anything about art but i know what i like
6102227 there is nothing the utility of which is more incontestable to what shall the character of utility be ascribed if not to that which is a source of pleasure
6102228 so programming is beautiful its all very well for you to declaim that i should take pleasure in creating elegant and charming programs but how am i supposed to make this mess into a work of art

6102237 if at first you dont succeed so much for skydiving
6102238 incredible performance by usain bolt once again he finished up in an incredible time this was an incredible performance he wanted that record
6102239 he got an incredible start i looked at his start and just went wow it was more amazing than the 100 metres guys that tall should not be able to start like that
6102240 he wanted that record this is his favourite event he went for it he came in focused on it knowing he would most likely win the gold
6102241 my concern was he would not have the ability to hold that speed for the entire race but he showed he has been working on that he used every ounce of energy he wanted that record
6102242 im just happy that im healthy and im looking forward to thursday over the years jamaica is very strong and i think everyone is just working very hard
6102243 i cant imagine that its possible for someone to do better within the program we have
6102244 if they want to add a couple of days then maybe but that was a very special accomplishment and were not looking to replicate it
6102245 were just going to try and move forward and set some other goals i think this is a high watermark in terms of the total number of medals
6102246 i think it will only help his 200 to have a faster 100 so that fits in well with what were trying to do it but theres no chance of going up
6102247 i think that he has goals to work towards and things that are exciting to us and that will mean doing something thats new
6102248 i thought about phelpsy for the australians but probably not
6102249 i just think thats a lot of pressure to put on a horse
6102250 only on my way here dolle phoned me to say this athlete tested positive the process is under way
6102251 that makes it bittersweet id have been really upset if shed won gold the penalty you should pay if you take drugs is not to compete at the olympics
6102252 the ioc took the measures with the olympic games we could also do similar things and take sanctions with regard to the world championships
6102253 the ioc was very clear in the lead up we would work in concert with all the anti doping bodies
6102254 we feel the deterrent effect plays a part in what we see here the athletes know the ioc means business
6102255 i hope this medal can be a message of peace in afghanistan
6102256 when i heard the national anthem i was truly emotional and i got goosebumps
6102257 its not the kind of thing that we in our wildest dreams would expect to happen in our hospitals in our wildest nightmares i guess
6102258 this is sports its never been a political statement on my end
6102259 i dont agree with everything that our government does and i dont agree with everything the russian government does
6102260 when i was a little girl there was no wnba so the olympics was the highest thing and in my opinion its still the highest thing in basketball
6102261 the dream of playing in the olympics is something ive carried around with me for 30 years
6102262 if you play in this country live in this country and you grow up in the heartland and you put on a russian uniform you are not a patriotic person
6102263 i dont expect everybody to understand or jump on my bandwagon
6102264 i know how i feel about my country im very proud of what america represents to the world but this is a basketball game this is not life or death the real heroes are over in im playing a game
6102265 now that i am at home i will try to win it back
6102266 i hope our victories will show that china has great boxers
6102267 we can compete with everyone when we have the chance
6102268 its very difficult for the boxers especially asian boxers because their skills are based on technique
6102269 emblazoned on the mallet heads it was going to be a noisy night on the ship one sailor predicted
6102270 it is hard to look at them when you are eating them
6102271 but you dont need butter like you do with lobster and they have flavor they are good
6102272 i dont eat anything that has a leg sticking out of it
6102273 in the end too i think its obvious youre playing another championship team and if youre not at your best youre not going to fare too well
6102274 weve been in six big 12 championships and we won five of them we are doing something right we know how to win those games so well manage the others the best we can
6102275 people in oklahoma arent satisfied unless you win a national championship
6102276 i know we can do a better job of closing things out we will finish strong this year
6102277 hes one of those special athletes everybody sees the great speed and moves that he has but hes also a physical guy too when you get up next to him and you pat him on the shoulder theres a lot to that guy hes a stronger runner i think than people might notice
6102278 he was so fast he had to swim with older swimmers and because i was a new coach and i wanted to impress them and think i was tough i gave them an extremely difficult training programme
6102279 because michael was the youngest he would go to the back of the line but by the end of the practice and at the most difficult part of the training session i saw a little cap moving up forward to the front of the line with each repeat swim
6102280 it was so remarkable id never seen anything like it and when i went home that night i couldnt sleep i was so excited but of course i didnt tell him that
6102281 when i disciplined him and tried to get him to stop playing around i said you should be very tired thats the hardest practice youve ever done
6102282 ill never forget he looked me straight in the eye and said i dont get tired so i made that my life goal to see if i could accomplish that
6102283 he was just 11 but six months later he swam those exact times to the one hundredth of a second
6102284 he always had a very good sense of finding where he wants to go and how to go there
6102285 i saw them sitting in our team area i could have taken the goggles to him but i decided to keep them and see what he could do
6102286 so he swam and won the race without the goggles just like he did here in the 200 butterfly when his goggles filled with water
6102287 ive always tried to find ways to give him adversity in either meets or practice and have him overcome it
6102288 quiero pedirle a todos los fans que por favor no nos dejen solos estoy bien loca porque en el foro de la p gina oficial ya les dije que hagamos una marcha mundial y me rega aron que por qu ando haciendo cosas as les dije que el 23 de agosto hagan una marcha en todos los pa ses para que esto no se acabe mi vida se llama rbd no s qu va a pasar son cosas del destino que no est n a nuestro alcance

6102300 faculty and two are sent to the chorus while the rest remain in contention for a lead role in an upcoming music video
6102301 i am certain mr molloy that your fantasies are rife with sex with young coeds it is a common myth that sexual favors are exchanged for grades or that coeds far from home seek validation through sexual congress with authority figures i find the implications of your statement abhorrent
6102302 thanks for the vocabulary lesson doc nice if you answered the question though
6102303 im sure if i go out there and ask someone will know someone who has slept with you no wedding ring no picture of a sweetheart on your desk youve been tempted
6102304 when i was younger i well let us say that i learned my lesson i am human and enjoy carnal pleasure as much as the next person but i was not sleeping with sarah brown
6102305 she has a boyfriend to be quite frank he and his associates frighten me so i have begun to distance myself from sarah our meetings are in public places no longer late at night this has upset her she told her boyfriend to back off i dont know how that went
6102306 he was escorted off campus after a row in the library
6102307 her roommate says she bought a home pregnancy kit came up positive she thinks sarah ran off with the baby daddy
6102308 paramour lover i do crosswords doc i can come up with more
6102309 understand something mr molloy what you do with language what i can do with language is but a fraction of what sarahs skill affords her shes incredibly talented i considered it a sacred duty to be able to help her develop her skills when you find her tell her i am willing to continue mentoring her her gift should not be denied to the world
6102310 they dont because they find you distracting im sure talia
6102311 you want to get out of range of his lightning bolts
6102312 larson did not take well my asking if he was sleeping with sarah
6102313 just so you know pretty much any faculty member would be insulted by the question you hit larson with professor student liaisons are the dirty little secrets that make campus life interesting
6102314 when people come into contact with authority figures they often default to coping strategies that have worked for them in the past the most common model is parent child the dynamic is familiar and easy to abuse i have no sexual desire or taste for children either chronological or behavioral i choose not to do it because of that
6102315 your finding me outside the english department wasnt an accident was it
6102316 i wont lie to you i figured youd be back to see doctor larson today was your best chance of catching him i stalked you
6102317 i said i wouldnt lie you intrigue me i find you attractive i figured i needed to seek you out because you wouldnt come back to find me
6102318 white knight syndrome you ride off to save the damsel in distress its a strong motif but one with a dark side its like all the westerns and samurai stories the white knight can save the day but hes never worthy of love hes always alone he seeks an idealized woman and no one ever measures up

6102369 i donated to the obama campaign because i was so excited and thrilled to hear him speak
6102370 i like what he says and i like what he represents and its a world stage today for any political leader
6102371 it was an error of me to give the donation and it was an error that it was accepted

6102373 were always looking for ways to best comply with all provisions of campaign finance regulations and obviously take swift action anytime flags are raised regarding potentially problematic campaign contributions
6102374 the polls show 25 percent of her supporters have not gotten on board
6102375 hes got to be very concerned by the neck in neck polls and by what happened at saddleback
6102376 over the last week weve seen sen obamas lead in the poll of polls cut in half
6102377 this change was likely driven by a renewed focus on foreign policy after russias invasion of georgia as well as by sen mccains willingness to launch more aggressive attacks against obama on issues such as off shore drilling
6102378 since obama returned from his overseas trip it seems like mccain has thrown all the punches clearly the blows have landed in recent days obama is fighting back going after mccain on the economy the issue voters care about most mccain has changed the dynamic of the race heading into the two conventions that puts more pressure on obama to go to denver and effectively define himself and mccain
6102379 thats not an issue on the table and i just want to keep our focus on what we must do with the democratic government of pakistan
6102380 whether im impeached or not the countrys stability will be compromised the office of the president will also be insulted pakistan is my love now and always my life is for pakistan i have defended and will continue to defend pakistan i want to be able to bring pakistan out of the current crisis so i think perhaps i should do something but i also do not want to do something that may generate uncertainty in the country i also want to save the parliament from horse trading even if the impeachment is defeated the relations between the presidents office and the coalition govt will not heal therefore with this situation in view and having consulted my legal and political advisors i have decided to resign from my post
6102381 how much i hate india and how much i will sacrifice to save muslim brothers in kashmir
6102382 that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
6102383 senator mccain was in a motorcade led by the united states secret service and held in a green room with no broadcast feed
6102384 may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
6102385 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
6102386 that room was totally free with no monitors a flat out lie
6102387 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because that what theyre putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
6102388 a motorist survey this year by the rubber manufacturers association found that 85 percent of american drivers do not properly check tire inflation pressure this is an alarming statistic since tires are the only part of a vehicle in contact with the road and a critical vehicle safety component
6102389 drivers across the u s can battle rising gas prices by simply maintaining proper tire inflation
6102390 current statistics indicate that 82 million vehicles have under inflated tires which means more rubber is hitting the road and accordingly miles per gallon is lessened in fact tire experts speculate that 2 8 billion gallons of gas is wasted by u s drivers each year simply because theyre driving on under inflated tires
6102391 the chps traffic safety commitment extends to safety campaigns like these which aim to reduce needless fatalities and injuries on california highways
6102392 our research shows that this improper inflation issue has been prevalent for years
6102393 that andreas excuse for leveling accusation against mac you buy into that prfsr
6102394 we as a campaign have not said anything about it though the mccain folks do seem pretty sensitive on the point
6102395 he made time to go to the gym but canceled a visit with wounded troops
6102396 obama had no intention of bringing any cameras with him i was there i can vouch for that

6102414 the immense financial burdens caused by inadequate enforcement of federal immigration laws
6102415 the concern of this court is that in these lawsuits potentially meritorious legal and factual defenses are not being litigated and instead the federal judiciary is being used as a hammer by a small group of plaintiffs to pound settlements out of unrepresented defendants
6102416 rule 11 b 3 requires that a representation in a pleading have evidentiary support and one wonders if the plaintiffs are intentionally flouting that requirement in order to make their discovery efforts more convenient or to avoid paying the proper filing fees in my view the court would be well within its power to direct the plaintiffs to show cause why they have not violated rule 11 b with their allegations respecting joinder i t is difficult to ignore the kind of gamesmanship that is going on here these plaintiffs have devised a clever scheme to obtain court authorized discovery prior to the service of complaints but it troubles me that they do so with impunity and at the expense of the requirements of rule 11 b 3 because they have no good faith evidentiary basis to believe the cases should be joined
6102417 by sale or other transfer of ownership or by rental lease or lending
6102418 i nfringement of the distribution right requires an actual dissemination of either copies or phonorecords 2 nimmer on copyright 8 11 a at 8 124 1
6102419 p laintiffs unreasonably rejected or sought to suppress evidence to the extent it tended to exonerate defendant
6102420 n either the parties submissions nor the courts own research has revealed any case holding the mere owner of an internet account contributorily or vicariously liable for the infringing activities of third persons
6102421 i see no reason for the court to take immediate action in this case as there is no evidence that records are about to be destroyed
6102422 if the owner of the shared folder simply provides a member of the public with access to the work and the means to make an unauthorized copy the owner is not liable as a primary infringer of the distribution right but rather is potentially liable as a secondary infringer of the reproduction right
6102423 t he inducement rule is a sensible one for copyright we adopt it here holding that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties one infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement
6102424 plaintiff must present at least some facts to show the plausibility of their allegations of copyright infringement however plaintiffs have presented no facts that would indicate that this allegation is anything more than speculation
6102425 plaintiffs are ordered to file any future cases of this nature against one defendant at a time and may not join defendants for their convenience
6102426 a n overwhelming majority of cases brought by recording companies against individuals are resolved without so much as an appearance by the defendant usually through default judgment or stipulated dismissal the defendant does cannot question the propriety of joinder if they do not set foot in the courthouse
6102427 n either floridas litigation privilege nor the noerr pennington doctrine serves as a shield for sham litigation
6102428 the court is unaware of any other authority that authorizes the ex parte subpoena requested by plaintiffs
6102429 plaintiffs contend that unless the court allows ex parte immediate discovery they will be irreparably harmed
6102430 p laintiffs can cite to no case foreclosing the applicability of the due process clause to the aggregation of minimum statutory damages proscribed under the copyright act on the other hand lindor cites to case law and to law review articles suggesting that in a proper case a court may extend its current due process jurisprudence prohibiting grossly excessive punitive jury awards to prohibit the award of statutory damages mandated under the copyright act if they are grossly in excess of the actual damages suffered
6102431 d istributing unlawful copies of a copyrighted work does violate the copyright owners distribution right and as a result constitutes copyright infringement
6102432 t his court finds that defendants use of the same isp and p2p networks to allegedly commit copyright infringement is without more insufficient for permissive joinder under rule 20 this court will sever not only the moving defendants from this action but all other doe defendants except doe 2

6102440 being asked to design the d amp ad annual this year was not only a great honour but also a challenge
6102441 the question was how to create something which would reflect a dynamic state one in which we find ourselves today
6102442 the very real schism and understanding gap between digital and anti digital design and anti design decoration and art direction presents us with a wonderful opportunity for debate and growth
6102443 the book itself is intended to be an experimental and living statement presenting design as a transient and vital part of society more than just a self reflective museum

6102526 i told her to get on the bus with her baby and i pushed the car to the side of the road
6102527 there was no way her and that baby were staying there
6102528 i carried her luggage on the bus and drove on to llandod llandrindod wells
6102529 once we got there a couple of my regular passengers took her to their house so she could feed the baby get warm and sort the car out

6102532 for i know the plans i have for you declares the lord plans to prosper you and not to harm you plans to give you hope and a future
6102533 this is part of the reason for the huge explosion in self publishing made possible when technology and print on demand publishers gave writers the keys to the factory
6102534 you can publish pretty much anything you can think of
6102535 i think weve just scratched the surface weve got a hundred million ideas of things we want to do
6102536 the revolution in publishing is self publishing an author a creator of any kind can now take their fate in their own hands
6102537 most should self publish to make more money to get to press sooner to keep control of their work
6102538 you get more credibility for a printed book than for an e book

6102543 i only managed to leave gaza in april when i trained in amman for one month and then one month in china as part of the olympic solidarity programme
6102544 im not happy with my result but thats all due to a lack of competition
6102545 when youre away and out of competition like this you cant compete against the champions
6102546 i kept pace for the first 2000m but after that i needed to show more endurance which i didnt have because of my lack of competition

6102550 sheer blond perfection handsome muscular a real sweetheart hes a good ol boy he also looked amazing in that silver wrestling singlet
6102551 jett blakk presented me with the perfect script and i saw it as the ideal opportunity to cross over eight of our hottest active duty stars to fill out the entire cast of a dirty bird pictures release
6102552 but i decided to make the wrestling show more of a rural circuit thing and have the story center on a guy whos tempted to join them
6102553 all but three of these guys had only done amateur stuff which is very loosely structured and shot in an easygoing style
6102554 my shoots have scripts and call times and makeup and glamour layouts
6102555 and as a result they are more structured i didnt know how the guys would take to that
6102556 i had never worked with any of the active duty men
6102557 so while they were all buddies i was the outsider and i didnt know how theyd respond to my authority as the director
6102558 it turned out not to be a big deal the guys were so gorgeous my crew gushed over them dink visited the set and threw us a barbecue it was like a frat house

6102563 in my travels round the world i have always been surprised that no matter where i go people recognize and know me from europe australia and india to the philippines and the zulu nation in south africa
6102564 this got me thinking i realized that while two people from two entirely different countries and backgrounds may seem to have nothing in common the only thing they might have in common is me so i decided to start a network where people from across the world might come together and get a conversation started over me
6102565 adventures of my life that no one else gets to see
6102566 an outstanding cpc communist party member a long tested and loyal communist fighter and a proletarian revolutionary who once held important leading posts in the cpc and the government
6102567 he wasnt adequately strong he should never have become maos successor and then he was deposed very gently it was rather a sad life
6102568 if you compared him with deng xiaoping he didnt have the gravitas the seniority that deng had

6102573 the ship has 39 crew of which 29 are malaysians and 10 filipinos
6102574 the number of chinese couples applying to adopt children has risen substantially in recent years
6102575 our policy is in line with the international practice of encouraging adoption by families within the country
6102576 but that does not mean we have any prejudice against foreign adoptions
6102577 now more and more chinese people are adopting kids simply because they love children and are proud to become foster parents

6102580 i think this is a direct and deliberate slight and snub to the leaders of the pacific island countries assembled here in niue
6102581 the challenge for us in these meetings is to uphold and stand firmly behind that principle of democracy
6102582 what im hearing from others whove been to fiji is that the commodore is not just baulking at the commitment for march 2009
6102583 there is no timetable for 2009 2010 2012 or any other time
6102584 let me place on record that the commitments that commodore bainimarama made at the leaders retreat were not forced on him as some have claimed
6102585 pacific island countries are saying to the countries of the world that the time for action concrete action over climate change is now

6102595 for the naysayers out there that would say the lights are out the lights are very dim on sco and its only a matter of time until there are no lumens coming out of the light bulbs and the games over thats far from what the truth is
6102596 the truth is the substantial amount of investment weve put into this mobile business in the past four years its in the tens of millions of dollars is now ready to go into harvest mode
6102597 we think itll actually be a killer application in the world of mobile phones
6102598 theyre going to the organizations that rely on franklincovey and will listen to them with an open mind
6102599 they actually have a decent pedigree with regard to their technical skills
6102600 but the problem is they carry so much baggage along with their corporate name that getting somebody to take a meeting so they can pitch the product is incredibly difficult im not convinced they can ramp the volume
6102601 itll be a lot more valuable out from beneath the sco brand
6102602 we really have a lot of confidence in it its very fast its easy to use youre always connected in real time its talking to a server and its always being updated
6102603 as we move forward at some point well have to answer that question what i can say is im very committed to sco stakeholders to finish off this battle that we started five years ago we believe it is time now to go in and get things finished off

6102609 once upon a time a man named tom started an online community called myspace it has since become the preeminent networking tool for musicians comedians filmmakers actors singers and people in general all around the world people are joining myspace by the millions it has become a cultural phenomenon weve decided to musicalize it
6102610 the premise eight strangers search for their true identities using myspace as a tool to find themselves these eight characters based on people you might meet on myspace come together on stage for a hilarious yet thought provoking night of musical comedy they are all from different walks of life but they seek one thing in common approval
6102611 i was amused to read davids comments that he would rather his side suffered relegation every other season than be like middlesbrough david is a good friend but i can only assume relegation has affected his thinking a little
6102612 i seriously doubt boro fans would swap our recent histories
6102613 since moving to the riverside in 1995 we have achieved five major cup finals are the only english side outside of the so called big four to have played in a european final have enjoyed successive seasons of uefa cup football won our first major trophy and enjoyed 11 consecutive years in the premier league
6102614 unfortunately chris smith had to pull out of the scotland under 21 squad
6102615 he has been suffering with a niggling injury for a few weeks which has been gradually getting worse although he had been trying to work through it
6102616 he did report along with scott cuthbert to the scotland under 21 assembly on sunday night but he was sent back to the club
6102617 im disappointed for chris that he cant get away with the scotland under 21 squad as he may have had a chance of representing his country but the most important thing is his fitness
6102618 apart from chris everybody is more or less okay the players who had been injured have been doing their rehab programmes and hopefully should be back with us soon
6102619 you dont need a long vacation to go to these places and there are agencies which organise treks rafting and waterfall rappelling you really cant get more out of a weekend
6102620 most of the locations are about two to four hours away we take groups in vehicles and organise porters and medical aid there is one instructor for every group of six seven trekkers
6102621 now you see people who are new to mumbai or maharashtra earlier there was little information available about these places so it was restricted to locals college students or serious trekkers who were interested in history and at the same time wanted an adventurous getaway
6102622 the villagers help us when we arrive there tired and fatigued over time the bond grows beyond money when heavy rains destroyed some of these villages in 2005 some trekkers got together and provided relief and money it is extremely heartening to see such friendships develop

6102626 i know that some people were panicking a bit during the summer because sean odriscoll hadnt brought in a lot of new players after winning promotion but that was never the intention
6102627 had he done that it would have changed the complexion of the team and thats not the way to do it
6102628 but as for me and my house we will serve the lord
6102629 weve been on this path for the last few years theres no doubt this year has seen some very very bold changes necessarily so and entirely reflective of what our buyers and sellers want
6102630 judge otoole however looked closely at the statute and held that the cfaa does not apply to security researchers like the students talking to people
6102631 beyond this core constitutional principle eff is defending the ability to conduct security research in the digital age as we note in our vulnerability reporting faq security researchers by definition raise questions that corporations and government agencies would prefer to keep quiet but by investigating flaws in security and alerting the public to vulnerabilities researchers play an important role in keeping private and public institutions accountable

6102637 the public was given a direct voice into the process and now has an even greater voice than ever before in making decisions said william j p banks 36th who co chaired the mayors zoning reform commission and has headed the councils zoning committee for almost 20 years since mayor richard daley took office
6102638 now its not to say that the aldermanic prerogative is out the door
6102639 there is still just as much strength as there always was
6102640 its just that now aldermen are kind of forced to sit down with the general public and get their views
6102641 but nothing in the new zoning code actually requires aldermen to involve the public in the process
6102642 asked why the councils zoning meetings are held at 10 a m on weekdays when most people have to work banks noted that every council committee gathers during daytime hours and he has given no thought to changing that
6102643 ask and it will be given to you seek and you will find knock and it will be opened to you
6102644 assuredly i say to you if you have faith and do not doubt you will not only do what was done to the fig tree but also if you say to this mountain be removed and be cast into the sea it will be done and whatever things you ask in prayer believing you will receive
6102645 there was in a certain city a judge who did not fear god nor regard man
6102646 hear what the unjust judge said and shall god not avenge his own elect who cry out day and night to him though he bears long with them i tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man comes will he really find faith on the earth
6102647 through the prayers of our holy fathers lord jesus christ son of god have mercy on us and save us amen
6102648 for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit now and ever and unto ages of ages
6102649 make thy good thy love thy mercy and kindness to triumph over the sin and evil done to us and that we do
6102650 we are told by the holy fathers that we are supposed to see in everything something for our salvation if you can do this you can be saved
6102651 the true christian is a warrior making his way through the regiments of the invisible enemy to his heavenly homeland
6102652 anyone who is attracted merely by glittering censors incense and beautiful vestments he first of all will fall down before antichrist
6102653 when i became christian i voluntarily crucified my mind and all the crosses that i bear have only been a source of joy for me i have lost nothing and gained everything
6102654 do not trust your mind too much thinking must be refined by suffering or it will not stand the test of these cruel times
6102655 consider now for the lord has chosen you to build a temple as a sanctuary be strong and do the work
6102656 however we will take legal advice and look into demands made by the farmers for more compensation earlier if there are provisions to give more compensation it will be handed over to the farmers
6102657 there was an earthquake at about 4 a m but it was only for seconds so far there is no report of any casualties
6102658 we fear that the quakes might cause damage to the dams if there are frequent quakes there is a danger that the dams might collapse we are afraid of the consequences of the quakes
6102659 im clear absolutely 100 percent clear and clean it did not spread they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer
6102660 my decision after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me the only one that seemed the most logical and the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy
6102661 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing and squishing and everything i just wanted to kind of be rid of this whole thing for me this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one
6102662 oh my god i was so pissed off so mad i was just shaking
6102663 immediately i had to go into take care of business mode
6102664 the thing that should give us pause is that in many chinese military manuals they identify the us as the country they are most likely to go to war with
6102665 says gary kebbel journalism program director for the john s and james l knight foundation which funds holovatys project with a 1 1 million grant
6102666 weve been seeking corporate partners all along to help us design schools and ultimately to help us run schools
6102667 our approach has been to partner with everyone we can
6102668 were literally building something that is going to help make peoples lives better in another part of the world
6102669 employees and suppliers have devoted time and expertise in various areas to create a unique project that is going to benefit thousands
6102670 with an airstream everything is curved which is much harder to design around
6102671 whose participation in a felony that results in murder is major and whose mental state is one of reckless indifference
6102672 this case has in it virtually every feature that makes the death penalty system in texas so scandalous
6102673 governor perry urged to grant thirty day reprieve for inmate convicted under texas law of parties who did not actually commit murder
6102674 despite todays decision by the parole board we are urging governor perry to grant a 30 day reprieve while the court of criminal appeals considers appointing a mental health expert to evaluate mr wood
6102675 given his longstanding history of mental illness governor perry must not allow mr woods execution to go forward without allowing the court to rule on this rudimentary due process right
6102676 ha d a delusional system an inability to grasp the reality surrounding the issues specific to this case his role in it in the crime as well as other things that present a direct threat to his own well being his own sense of self
6102677 we are in constant touch with the assam government and keeping a close watch on the situation we will provide additional forces if the situation worsens
6102678 that depends on how the nsg exemption is worded and so we will have to see how that is worked out
6102679 our hope is to do things expeditiously in the iaea board in the nsg and with some understanding from our congress to move expeditiously there so that theres no question of some people going ahead of others
6102680 we are both trying to make it all work together
6102681 we must tackle the high rate of wasteful consumption to which our society has become accustomed
6102682 the attitudes of individuals and organisations must be altered so that waste is not just viewed as being costly but as being socially unacceptable
6102683 im angesicht tats chliche gefahr versagt man auf ganzer linie
6102684 its not the kind of thing that we in our wildest dreams would expect to happen in our hospitals in our wildest nightmares i guess
6102685 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6102686 that hairline difference between nuance and what appears to be flip flopping is hurting him with liberal voters
6102687 conservatives were supposed to be the bigger problem for mccain
6102688 obama still has work to do on his base at this point mccain seems to be doing a better job with his
6102689 there were no wild swings there isnt one group that is radically different than last month or even two months ago it was just a steady decline for obama across the board

6102697 baru baru ini saya menonton tayangan berita tentang pengiriman tenaga perawat dari indonesia ke luar negeri seperti jepang di stasiun televisi bbc ini menarik dan suatu kemajuan yang berarti
6102698 saya pikir pengiriman tenaga terampil seperti itu di masa depan akan meningkat untuk memenuhi kebutuhan di luar negeri sehingga tenaga kerja indonesia di luar negeri tak lagi didominasi mereka yang bekerja sebagai pembantu rumah tangga

6102732 we do not simply advocate lowering the drinking age as a solution to a very serious problem
6102733 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
6102734 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
6102735 it should be obvious to anyone that the current system is broken and isnt doing what it should to protect the health safety and well being of our children
6102736 and if what we are doing now doesnt work then we have an obligation to ourselves and to society to explore what might
6102737 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
6102738 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
6102739 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
6102740 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
6102741 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
6102742 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
6102743 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
6102744 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
6102745 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
6102746 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
6102747 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
6102748 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
6102749 i have an habitual feeling of my real life having past and that i am leading a posthumous existence

6102759 this was back in the 70s i was sitting with my dad and his friends in a cloud of blue pot smoke looking at cigarette ads for subliminal messages thats how i learned about photography that there could be a lot of meaning packed into a photographic image whether its real or not
6102760 a distorted stretched out blood red map of the us used to cover up a failed business venture
6102761 i had a professor who said i didnt have the love of language to be a poet
6102762 he drove me right into the arms of the photography department but i never lost my fascination with language
6102763 its like ive been dropped into this place to see this thing and show it to people
6102764 everything is sort of there and its your experience that makes you notice it and want to communicate it its a shift from the artist as creative genius to the artist as looking at something in the world
6102765 i began wondering are these distinctions still relevant all photographs are illusions yet we have an implicit trust in the veracity of images even in our modern digital age
6102766 how does the media and image culture create the tenuous but powerful illusion of centrality
6102767 in swimming there are so many little things you can change that really do make a big difference in the end were able to go back to the drawing board and work on the small things that can make a big difference
6102768 for me when i watch other sports when i watch tiger woods when i watch roger federer when i watch rafael nadal the best athletes can compete under any circumstances no matter what it is no matter what the pressure you can always overcome whatever is put in your way
6102769 i dont think about it like that i think of it as something i love to do and i am having fun with it
6102770 doing normal high school kid things was something i was willing to give up i know i wont have opportunities like this in the sport for the rest of my life
6102771 good bye little nivard you will now have all the lands and property for yourself

6102795 mgm is a great place for the many worlds of jonas moore
6102796 there has never been a black british action hero before and what appealed to me was that mgm understood this from the outset jonas moore is sophisticated educated tough and uber cool he represents the next generation of intelligent action heroes of international sci fi drama
6102797 there are some professional cartoonists who hate their jobs why on earth are they working on cartoons they hate it couldnt possibly be for the money if i were going to do a job i hated just because i needed the money id sell weapons it pays better than cartooning

6102799 even if not in numbers the darfur genocide is of the same order of moral magnitude as the shoah it will haunt us in whatever day of judgment we face and it will haunt us when civil and civilized people at last come to bring some just order to the world including the moment when some court renders justice
6102800 h ow can the arabs feign such great agitation about the unfortunate palestinians when they maintain such composure about the truly bitter fate of the darfuris it is the blood of their blood who are committing the genocide it is their diplomats who protect the murderers pass it all off as if it were nothing when it is the rankest mass blood letting in a decade

6102811 there is no point in signing an agreement at this point in time
6102812 we will review the agreement in light of the comments given by the supreme court justices and in the light of what is happening in mindanao

6102819 perhaps companies will want to put windfarms atop our bridges and skyscrapers or use the enormous potential of powerful off shore winds miles out in the atlantic ocean where turbines could generate roughly twice the energy that land based windfarms can

6102822 fox would rather see watchmen killed instead of collecting a percentage at the box office
6102823 of course we are concerned about the fans however any disappointment from the core fans should not be directed toward fox what we are doing is seeking to enforce our distribution rights to watchmen legal copyright ownership should not just be swept under the rug and ignored
6102824 we respectfully disagree with foxs position and do not believe they have any rights in and to this project
6102825 did not opine at all on the merits other than to conclude that fox satisfied the pleading requirements
6102826 it is particularly noteworthy that nothing on the face of the complaint or the documents supplied to the court establishes that watchmen producer larry gordon the claimed source of warner brothers interest in watchmen ever acquired any rights in watchmen

6102834 tell him hes f ng amazing and i want to meet him
6102835 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
6102836 one of the things weve seen over and over again is that parents have difficulty getting redress if a child is paddled and severely injured or paddled in violation of parents wishes
6102837 international human rights law puts a pretty strong prohibition on corporal punishment
6102838 i didnt get any bruises but they still hurt and from that point on i told myself and my parents i wasnt going to take any more paddlings
6102839 just about everyone at the beginning of the year said if he or she gives you any trouble you can paddle them you can send them home and ill paddle them or you can have me come out to the school and we can both paddle them
6102840 its really just a part of the culture of the school environment there
6102841 the use of corporal punishment is associated almost overwhelmingly with negative effects and that it increases childrens problem behavior over time
6102842 we teach our children that violence is wrong yet corporal punishment teaches children that violence is a way to solve problems
6102843 it perpetuates a cycle of child abuse it teaches children to hit someone smaller and weaker when angry

6103010 we are deeply saddened by the loss of paul dean
6103011 he was an inspiring and innovative leader who brought georgetown law to the forefront of legal education
6103012 receiving the body and blood of christ unworthily is a sacrilege
6103013 if it is done deliberately in mortal sin it is a sacrilege
6103014 public officials who with knowledge and consent uphold actions that are against the divine and eternal moral law for example if they support abortion which entails the taking of innocent and defenseless human lives a person who commits sin in this way should be publicly admonished in such a way as to not receive communion until he or she has reformed his life
6103015 if a person who has been admonished persists in public mortal sin and attempts to receive communion the minister of the eucharist has the obligation to deny it to him why above all for the salvation of that person preventing him from committing a sacrilege
6103016 we must avoid giving people the impression that one can be in a state of mortal sin and receive the eucharist
6103017 secondly there could be another form of scandal consisting of leading people to think that the public act that this person is doing which until now everyone believed was a serious sin is really not that serious if the church allows him or her to receive communion
6103018 if we have a public figure who is openly and deliberately upholding abortion rights and receiving the eucharist what will the average person think he or she could come to believe that it up to a certain point it is okay to do away with an innocent life in the mothers womb
6103019 it is not with the intention of interfering in public life but rather in the spiritual state of the politician or public official who if catholic should follow the divine law in the public sphere as well
6103020 therefore it is simply ridiculous and wrong to try to silence a pastor accusing him of interfering in politics so that he cannot do good to the soul of a member of his flock
6103021 to bear witness to our faith not only in private in our homes but also in our public lives with others in order to bear strong witness to christ

6103029 i dont want any sex offenders in this country but the point is vietnamese officials have deported him to the uk so as we do whenever sex offenders return to this country we need to plan for what happens when people return
6103030 never mind his individual case anybody who is returning to the uk in these sorts of circumstances would be met at the airport by police officers would be served with an order which effectively puts them on to the sex offenders register
6103031 one of the things we have learned generally about sex offenders is they do want to travel to places where they can exploit children
6103032 if there is evidence the person is travelling abroad to abuse children we can get an order that stops them travelling there should be more of those
6103033 in every single case the court has to make the decision but this is the type of case where i find it pretty hard to imagine it is legitimate for him to travel abroad again

6103552 at first we just had the education up front for free now as the education has grown our branch has changed we have the sales people on the front lines teaching they know how it works
6103553 people always wanted to know more and more and more but then after an inconvenient truth there was so much demand for cleaner energy and then there was a demand of people who wanted to know how to do it themselves and they were willing to pay so we started doing seminars at the headquarters
6103554 from teaching the basics of renewable energy systems all the way to courses appropriate for professionals that want to become installers for these systems or current installers who would like to brush up on some of their knowledge

6103563 a violent education corporal punishment of children in u s public schools
6103564 african american students are punished at 1 4 times the rate that would be expected given their numbers in the student population
6103565 by exposing these children to disproportionate rates of corporal punishment schools create a hostile environment in which these students may struggle even more
6103566 every public school needs effective methods of discipline but beating kids teaches violence and it doesnt stop bad behavior

6103584 because john mccain is just like bush on all the key issues from energy policy based on big oil to an economy tilted toward the rich many progressives seem to think that senator obama cant lose
6103585 but its time to stop counting our chickens and start planting some seeds
6103586 no problem im very calm ill win the gold medal
6103587 i kind of got out of control but i was able to pick it up on the last few hurdles
6103588 im very sorry i didnt make the final at home
6103589 i supported senator mccain in the primary because of our close personal friendship
6103590 but i do have two friends now and i always said that i would probably have to remain neutral if it became senator obama and senator mccain and i wouldnt work against either of them because they are close friends
6103591 both will offer change both are prepared to change what really has been the image and the position of the united states over the last couple of years
6103592 i think it really is a shame that it appears that he has decided to overlook probably the best governor and one thats supported him from the beginning gov napolitano
6103593 there is a man of principle there is a man who certainly can reach across the party aisle there is a man who puts our countrys defense first and the needs of this country first
6103594 you dont hear the presidential candidates debating it you dont hear those running for senate or house seats debating it yet its the most critically important issue that we in phoenix and arizona understand
6103595 were going to let them know whats going on here in phoenix and that reform cant wait another year or two or three it has to be the top priority of the new congress and the new president
6103596 the federal government if they want us to do that job they have to fund it
6103597 instead theyre doing less with more and cities are doing more with less and that has to turn around
6103598 no matter how much you score it doesnt change the outcome we lost by 30 points but it was a great feeling to be out there
6103599 personally it is just a great feeling to be involved in the greatest basketball tournament in the world
6103600 at the start of second half we wanted to come out and we had a particular set we wanted to run i had a lot of good looks and knocked them down
6103601 we know they are a good team they execute very well but our biggest strength is our depth we are going to wear you down
6103602 standing on the sideline you are 25 down and it is late in the game and you look at the scorers table and they are bringing in kobe and carmelo it was too much for us

6103667 but a few years ago i asked some students if they knew what watergate was and they said that was where monica lewinsky lived

6103675 it is amazing how similar the image scores appear to be for both barack obama and john mccain if obama is this agent of change that america has been waiting for why is his image no better than the nominee from the other party a political party whose brand is supposed to be so badly damaged
6103676 voters are looking for change that gives obama a real advantage in this election even as mccain tries to reinvent himself among undecided voters obama has a decided advantage in being better liked this poll also modeled a traditional electorate however obama has the ability to change the electorate simulating modest gains in youth turnout takes the ballot to a 2 point advantage for obama changing the face of the electorate is obamas ace in the hole
6103677 the candidates will use the upcoming conventions to reinforce their positive and comparative messages this survey acts as an important benchmark going into the remaining weeks of the campaign which includes the vice presidential picks acceptance speeches and three scheduled debates
6103678 the positive re evaluation of john mccain is the untold story of the last three months of this election john mccains biggest comparative gain over the last three months has come on the issue of gas and energy prices
6103679 obama has a decisive advantage on the economy and domestic agenda for the middle class that will determine this election among voters overall he is ahead 9 points on the economy and 15 points on being for the middle class among undecided voters obama is ahead 12 points and 27 points respectively that should translate into decisively taking the undecided voters

6103682 for children who are still late talkers in school it is important to provide early intervention and enrichment

6103689 is reportedly sounding out republicans about the viability of a pro abortion rights running mate fueling speculation that hes considering connecticut senator joe lieberman or former pennsylvania governor tom ridge
6103690 multiple gop sources say that party officials in washington and in the states have been contacted by the mccain campaign in the past two weeks and asked about the fallout
6103691 sources at the republican national committee now say theyve been told by mccains aides that the former pennsylvania governor tom ridge is no longer being considered mccain aides flatly refused to comment
6103692 slipped further down mccains list yesterday as evangelicals remained deeply opposed to the pro choice republican
6103693 sources say mccain is seriously considering a registered democrat joe lieberman the right wing is threatening a revolt

6103717 bereits bei einem drittel aller 128 arbeitslosenzentren und arbeitslosenberatungsstellen sind nach einer befragung der tr ger der argen und optionskommunen sowie der kommunen schon nachfolgevereinbarungen zur finanzierung abgeschlossen worden und ihr bestand ber den 30 09 2008 hinaus gesichert
6103718 hieran wird sehr deutlich dass es m glich ist mit kommunen arbeitsgemeinschaften argen und optionskommunen neue finanzierungsformen zu erschlie en
6103719 das nordrhein westf lische arbeitsministerium hatte f r diese f rderung j hrlich ca 4 6 mio aus mitteln des europ ischen sozialfonds esf aufgebracht diese f rderung seitens des landes kann nicht ber den 30 09 dieses jahres fortgef hrt werden da in der neuen eu phase deutlich weniger finanzielle mittel zur verf gung stehen der r ckgang um 40 prozent zwingt leider zu einschnitten in der arbeitsmarktpolitik des landes alle arbeitslosenzentren und beratungsstellen sollten konstruktiv die bestehenden gespr che mit kommunen argen und optionskommunen weiterf hren

6103724 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
6103725 should they initiate the draft you know the age is 18 if we can go out and fight and die for our country and you cant have a beer that doesnt make a lot of sense to me
6103726 whether the drinking age is 18 or 21 i dont think it really matters because if people are going to abuse alcohol theyre going to do it regardless of the law
6103727 a culture of dangerous clandestine binge drinking often conducted off campus has developed
6103728 alcohol education that mandates abstinence as the only legal option has not resulted in significant constructive behavioral change among our students
6103729 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
6103730 we also need to keep in mind that alcohol related traffic fatalities reached a ten year high in 2006
6103731 theyve been going up in the last ten years we also need to keep in mind that peer reviewed research shows more than 1 000 lives of 18 to 24 year olds are lost each year off the highways to alcohol the evidence is not all on one side of this debate and we need to consider all of those data and consider whether 21 is in fact serving us well
6103732 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
6103733 we know the 21 minimum age drinking law does work
6103734 theres 48 highly backed studies to back the fact that the law does work it saved over 1 000 young peoples lives every year for the last 24 years why would we go back we tried this in the 70s and 80s it simply did not work then alcohol related fatalities went up in that age group
6103735 college presidents dont want this passed down to them from college presidents who are being irresponsible
6103736 we know that people continue to drive for instance after a drunk driving conviction
6103737 theyll simply drive without their license up to 75 percent of convicted drunk drivers continue to drive why would we think that 18 year olds would drive or not drive you know its not the solution
6103738 the presidential statement simply says that based on our own experience and 24 years of this law on the books we believe theres evidence to show that 21 is not working that it has had unintended consequences and that it is well past time to open public debate about all of the effects of this law on our campuses and elsewhere
6103739 removing that 10 percent incentive is the surest way to resume the debate that needs to take place
6103740 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue

6103785 there was less blood loss with this procedure than with conventional surgery and there is the potential for a faster recovery
6103786 the results were outstanding and suggest the robot assisted surgery is an attractive option for fistulas that would normally require abdominal surgery

6103878 these sites provide a record for the future about the workings of the government in this day and time
6103879 most government information today is published on the web and not published in paper
6103880 in the past 10 years there has been a radical change in the way that information is published by the government to its constituents
6103881 the majority of information is actually made available through these web sites but they are changing very rapidly as new information is introduced and especially as administration changes occur
6103882 when bush took over the second that he was sworn in the white house web site went from being this massive collection of important links to a picture of bush and his biography and a picture of vice president cheney and his biography

6103901 this is not only a heinous act but tantamount to selling the countrys sovereignty and independence to another nation it is shameful utterly humiliating to every pakistani
6103902 it is high time that the present government act like an independent sovereign nation and form its own foreign policy leaving behind the legacy of a discredited military dictator
6103903 based on the testimony of detainees held in bagram in 2003 and 2004 it is clear that there was a woman being held at the base whether or not that woman was aafia siddiqi is something that at the moment cannot be verified
6103904 however dr siddiqi has confirmed that she was held in bagram for years
6103905 i fear for her life they probably dont want her to see the light of day
6103906 a close look at the picture in newspapers here shows the years of torture dark circles under her eyes a broken and badly fixed nose made up teeth and crumbled lips it is a picture of a severely dehydrated and unwell person almost as if on the deathbed it shows the inhumane brutality of a civilised nation by the administration of the country which claims to be civilised
6103907 she was suffering from multiple bullet wounds that had been not been attended to she came to court in a wheelchair and was suffering from intense abdominal pain for which she was given aspirin which could only act as poison for her ulcerous condition
6103908 my brother told me he saw the perpetrators and the victim together in one room there was not a shred of compassion just stony eyed hate
6103909 you know it would have been better if she had died i believed she had died and was reconciled to the idea that way i could move on and then she re surfaced like resurrected from the dead and that brought some hope but seeing her like this it just breaks my heart
6103910 after seeing aafias pictures splashed in newspapers across the country and the torture marks she bore for five years i fear for my husbands life too
6103911 but being a woman and a mother whose children have been separated from her i can feel the torment shes going through
6103912 to say that she aafia had been taken into custody only on jul 17 2008 is a blatant lie as transparently ugly as any falsehood can be the insinuation that she had been hiding herself since 2003 is a travesty of truth an affront to peoples commonsense
6103913 we consider dr aafias case an instance of utterly unconscionable and most brutal form of attack on a human beings individual rights
6103914 the hrcp had been calling for her recovery since 2003 and when it went to the supreme court in 2007 her name was high on the list the only mystery was the silence of aafias family
6103915 all these years we were told by various government people that she was alright and is well and not to probe too much or harm would come to her

6103921 granted theyre not slumping too much and the site is still performing extremely well but it is down nonetheless i think digg slowly lost its appeal when it stopped becoming a tech savvy haven and tried to expand into areas that its tech influenced crowd didnt care about
6103922 yahoo buzz is taking the digg idea improving it by reducing the frequency of people gaming it and launching with a focus on all topics with its own main page to back it up
6103923 how can digg compete on any one of those levels when digg was firmly focused on tech and didnt try to improve algorithms to make upcoming stories last longer before they went popular or stop certain influencers from being too successful people found some value in using the site but now its nothing more than a placeholder of derivative stories and outrageous comment threads
6103924 not just any stories will end up getting buzzed but when they do they get posted to the front page of yahoo com
6103925 thats some pretty major exposure and the level of traffic driven by yahoo once something gets buzzed is exponentially higher than most other social news sites including digg
6103926 i think the potential that future submissions could appear on the front page of yahoo com is a valuable prospect
6103927 i think yahoos system is going to result in much better front page headlines its less about who you know and more about the actual content
6103928 the possibility of getting on the home page of yahoo is a strong selling point for buzz on the other hand theyre a bit late to the game to open it up to everyone i think for certain types of news it could do well but on topics like tech itll be tough
6103929 yahoo does amazing things like delicious and flickr but then they do other really lame things like yahoo

6103933 effects of high fat diet exposure during fetal life on type 2 diabetes development in the progeny
6103934 people dont consume as much calcium as nutritionists would like
6103935 and one reason for this is that foods high in calcium dont taste good to many people tweaking its taste could encourage a calcium deficient population to consume more of this key nutrient
6103936 by understanding how calcium is detected in the mouth we can either make it easier to consume by reducing its bad taste or even make pharmacological agents that make it taste better
6103937 most mice dislike calcium but we found a very unusual strain that drinks it avidly
6103938 by comparing the genes of this strain with other strains we were able to identify the two calcium taste genes
6103939 it remains to be seen if what we have discovered in mice the existence of two calcium taste genes holds true for humans
6103940 we know people have the sweet taste gene tas1r3 and the gene involved with the calcium sensing receptor casr we dont know if we have the same forms of genes as the mice have but it seems pretty likely they have the same function
6103941 there isnt a better word for it it is bitter perhaps even a little sour but its much more because there are actual receptors for calcium not just bitter or sour compounds
6103942 in tap water its fairly pleasant but at levels much above that the taste becomes increasingly bad
6103943 im not saying people cant take tablets to get enough calcium but eating real food is a great pleasure with salt sweet and fat the problem is to reduce intake without reducing palatability for calcium its a problem of being not palatable enough
6103944 we looked at what we could do to address them and the whole area of air quality as it relates to the emission of ammonia from poultry houses
6103945 weve certainly been on a learning curve since 2001 about the different plant materials suitable for this practice we typically recommend the first row nearest the fans to be either a deciduous tree or a tree with a waxy leaf surface and the other two rows be an evergreen
6103946 its very important to realize there are a number of criteria that you use in tree selection and planting design what works for our soil types and climate on the delmarva peninsula may not be suitable for other locations
6103947 one initial concern was that it takes years for trees to grow to become effective in filtering out poultry house emissions but thats not necessarily the case
6103948 planting trees demonstrates that the poultry grower is being proactive to address potential concerns of neighbors gives the poultry farm a landscape appearance and increases property values adding the vegetative buffers also helps to reduce noise associated with farm operations

6103973 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6103974 that hairline difference between nuance and what appears to be flip flopping is hurting him with liberal voters
6103975 conservatives were supposed to be the bigger problem for mccain
6103976 obama still has work to do on his base at this point mccain seems to be doing a better job with his
6103977 there were no wild swings there isnt one group that is radically different than last month or even two months ago it was just a steady decline for obama across the board
6103978 what is this a center for ants how can we be expected to teach children to learn how to read if they cant even fit inside the building the center has to be at least three times bigger than this

6103992 ik vind de commotie best heftig dat mensen z verontwaardigd zowel positief als negatief reageren doordat het verhaal van de serie naar de achtergrond is gedrukt is deze foto totaal in een verkeerd contrast geplaatst bij de foto op zich mag je vragen stellen dat hoort bij de vrijheid van meningsuiting maar ik heb mij er vooral over verbaasd dat iemand de foto zomaar heeft weggehaald
6103993 iris probeert haar leven zo mooi mogelijk in te richten zowel mentaal als materialistisch de sprookjeswereld voor ilias het interieur en hoe moeder en zoon de wereld mooier maken dan hij in werkelijkheid misschien wel is toont een groot contrast tussen realiteit en fantasie deze twee bijzondere positief ingestelde mensen lijken afgesloten te zijn van de buitenwereld door middel van gesprekken en observaties binnenshuis laat ik hun leefomgeving zien er zit dus allesbehalve een aanstootgevende gedachte achter deze serie het is jammer hoe het is gegaan maar in zekere zin vind ik het ook mooi dat dit onderwerp nu bespreekbaar is
6103994 in hoeverre kan ik als homoseksueel de kerk aanspreken op haar afwijzing van mijn gepraktiseerde geaardheid als ik diep in mijn hart weet dat god mijn levensweg zegent en met de woorden van de bisschop met mij is alle dagen van mijn leven
6103995 de heer is altijd met ons dat is het allerbelangrijkste wij hebben een relationeel geloof wij moeten onze relatie met christus verdiepen en zichtbaar maken in onze relaties onderling hoe iemand in elkaar zit heeft hij of zij zelf niet in de hand leder is zoals hij of zij geschapen is leef met god en de mensen om je heen zoals jezus dat deed leef dus zoals het evangelie het jou voorhoudt

6104002 in de britse anglicaanse kerk is met verbazing gereageerd op een in londen gehouden geheime euchariastieviering van en voor homoseksuele kerkdienaren binnen deze geloofgemeenschap
6104003 daar had ze het bij kunnen houden helaas ik ben verhinderd
6104004 de lokale kerken van bergen op zoom het gemeentebestuur en alle andere betrokkenen een inspirerende kerkdienst en een feestelijke roze zaterdag toe
6104005 de reacties waren haast volledig in lijn met het thema van de dienst niet te geloven
6104006 want nu staat zwart op wit dat beatrix achter de roze zaterdag staat
6104007 het is geen geheim dat koningin beatrix tegenstander van de invoering van het homohuwelijk was daar ben ik dankbaar voor
6104008 ze steunt de achtergrond van roze zaterdag emancipatie van een groepering die hier en daar gediscrimineerd zelfs in elkaar geslagen wordt
6104009 daagt daarbij het koningshuis uit om kleur te bekennen oranje moet zich uiten over roze
6104010 een bezoek van haar aan roze zaterdag zou beslist niet samenbindend werken in onze samenleving
6104011 als waar is dat zij adhesie betuigde aan het gehele gedachtegoed van roze zaterdag betreur ik dat zeer
6104012 wie de sport niet beoefent moet zich ook niet met de spelregels bemoeien
6104013 och ze zijn een beetje aan de jonge kant voor mij maar ze mogen bij mij ook wel eens naakt door de straat komen rennen
6104014 enerzijds houdt hij hooggestemde verhalen over hoe de mensheid in elkaar hoort te zitten anderzijds knijpt hij op het toneel dames in de billen
6104015 vlak voor we weggingen was ik naar de huisarts geweest met een aanhoudend hoestje
6104016 maar in itali kreeg ik zon pijn op een plek ergens onder mijn lever dat ik naar een italiaanse dottore ging die had het over het ziekenhuis maar ik grapte dat ik alleen wilde worden geholpen in het ziekenhuis waar de paus ook wordt behandeld ik had zoveel pijn dat frank erop stond dat we naar huis zouden gaan ik ging meteen het medische circuit in en we hebben nu net de uitslagen van allerlei vervelende onderzoeken gehad ik ben ongeneeslijk ziek
6104017 vermoedelijk word ik volgende week geopereerd dan halen ze de kwade bocht uit mijn darm en een maand daarna krijg ik chemo de oncoloog is heel duidelijk hij kan me niet genezen maar wel de zaak verzachten ik geen moment overwogen om me niet te laten behandelen dat zou respectloos zijn ten opzichte van de wetenschap die mannen en vrouwen hebben daar jaren voor gestudeerd bovendien kunnen ze misschien nog van mijn geval leren
6104018 de artsen gaven hem toen nog een half jaar maar toen hij was uitbehandeld heeft zijn long de tumor ingekapseld een soort wonder op zon wonder hoop ik ook
6104019 samen in de duif luisteren zingen bidden en stil zijn betekent blij zijn met onze kleine wereld aan de prinsengracht maar als we dat eerlijk en oprecht voelen leggen we tegelijkertijd lijnen uit naar buiten jezus van nazareth ging ook grenzen over namelijk de n luistert de ander praat dat zijn gelijk waardige talenten ik kan goed luisteren maar wil best zo af en toe praten als dat tenminste van me gevraagd wordt
6104020 ik heb aangegeven dat ik vanuit carr wil worden begraven daar is de openbare wake zo hoort dat bij acteurs vandaar naar mijn kerk de duif een kippeneindje verderop voor de uitvaartdienst dan naar westgaarde met een lekkere hap en snap na afloop dus niet dat kopje koffie en een plakkie cake waardoor de mensen nog dieper in de put raken op mijn uitvaart is het een vrolijk samenzijn met buffetten en drank het ouderwetse begrafenismaal zullen we maar zeggen en die waren er niet voor niets en dan maar hopen dat mensen mij herinneren als een man die zijn best heeft gedaan in het leven
6104021 wanneer je dood bent groeien alle bomen door en is de groentenman om negen uur weer open
6104022 hem tot werktuig van zijn vrede te maken zodat ik liefde verspreid waar mensen elkaar haten
6104023 hij ligt er mooi bij we verliezen een groot iemand
6104024 want het is niet gebruikelijk dat correspondentie van koningin beatrix openbaar wordt gemaakt
6104025 de koningin heeft laten weten dat ze als gevolg van andere verplichtingen helaas verhinderd was om naar bergen op zoom te komen wel wenste ze ons heel erg veel succes en een bijzonder feestelijke dag
6104026 ze ondersteunt de gedachte achter de manifestatie een gelijke behandeling voor iedereen
6104027 maar weet je wat het verschil is tussen bergen op zoom en amsterdam in amsterdam wordt een homofeest afgelast omdat ze bang zijn dat hooligans die op een voetbaltoernooi afkomen de boel op stelten zetten hier in bergen op zoom is het een en al gemoedelijkheid e n groot feest
6104028 al blijft het spannend natuurlijk doel van roze zaterdag is om homoseksualiteit bespreekbaar n zichtbaar te maken maar je bent daarvoor wel afhankelijk van de mensen hoe leeft het binnen de doelgroep hoe reageert de bergse bevolking dat zijn toch vragen die aan de vooravond van zon evenement door je hoofd spoken
6104029 het is heel indrukwekkend om te zien hoe de bergse bevolking meeleeft de hele stad is versierd de mensen zijn massaal aanwezig het is prachtig om te zien hoe roze zaterdag hier aanmeert bergen op zoom is een relatief kleine stad maar dit festijn is groots
6104030 want homos en christenen staan niet tegenover elkaar sterker nog veel homoseksuelen hebben een christelijke achtergrond dat moet je niet negeren dat moet je bespreekbaar maken probleem is dat het juist de kerkleiders zijn die dat frustreren daarom waardeer ik het dat ze hier op lokaal niveau wel de juiste weg weten te vinden als de kerkleiders het laten afweten moet de beweging ontstaan in de achterban
6104031 het was helemaal top al waren we niet met velen
6104032 ik zag er nog een paar in het publiek staan
6104033 dan wil ik in de tuin van de zon genieten
6104034 de mensen leven alsof god niet bestaat ik denk dan in het bijzonder aan de grote crisis binnen het instituut van het huwelijk en families de stijging van het aantal scheidingen de grote aantallen abortussen en de mogelijkheid van verbintenissen tussen koppels van hetzelfde geslacht
6104035 wat gij niet wilt dat u geschied doet dat ook een ander niet
6104036 de muziek bij de psalmtekst is eenvoudig en melancholisch en ondersteunt prachtig het vragende karakter van de tekst
6104037 de inzendingen verschilden van een vermelding van de melodie met een verwijzing naar bijvoorbeeld het liedboek der kerken tot bladmuziek met uitgewerkte begeleidingen en zelfs ingezongen en gespeelde nieuwe psalmen dit zorgde voor moeilijke vergelijkingen tussen de verschillende inzendingen
6104038 ik voel mij echt een zeelandse jongen in dit verrukkelijke dorp waar mijn vader molenaar was heb ik een heerlijke jeugd gehad
6104039 toen de gemeente dit idee bij mij opperde heb ik niet geprotesteerd ook heb ik gewillig geposeerd maar om nu te zeggen dat ik vereerd ben nee ik ben pas vereerd als iemand die in moeilijkheden zit met mij erover wil praten dat is wezenlijk de rest is poeha
6104040 pater van kilsdonk is altijd bezig geweest met de groei van de mens om de ander te leren ontdekken wie hij ten diepste is ik voel gewoon dat hij eruit trekt wat belangrijk voor je is
6104041 ik ben blij dat wij pater van kilsdonk hebben ik ben ook erg blij dat wij maar n pater van kilsdonk hebben
6104042 ik ben niet trots op de katholieke kerk ik ken haar geschiedenis de nederlandse bisschoppen kennen die niet anders zouden ze niet zo verwaand preken
6104043 pervers is dat miljoenen geestdriftig voor de buis of computer zitten als twee mannen elkaar tot bloedens toe stompen of elkaar met woorden doden terwijl iedereen pijnlijk gekwetst is als twee mannen elkaar teder liefhebben
6104044 in hoeverre kan ik als homoseksueel de kerk aanspreken op haar afwijzing van mijn gepraktiseerde geaardheid als ik diep in mijn hart weet dat god mijn levensweg zegent en met de woorden van de bisschop met mij is alle dagen van mijn leven
6104045 de heer is altijd met ons dat is het allerbelangrijkste wij hebben een relationeel geloof wij moeten onze relatie met christus verdiepen en zichtbaar maken in onze relaties onderling hoe iemand in elkaar zit heeft hij of zij zelf niet in de hand leder is zoals hij of zij geschapen is leef met god en de mensen om je heen zoals jezus dat deed leef dus zoals het evangelie het jou voorhoudt

6104047 als het niet zo uitermate kwetsend zou zijn zou ik het weglachen
6104048 ik heb er juist alles aan gedaan om de boodschap van naastenliefde goed over het voetlicht te brengen
6104049 het is jammer dat het evangelie desondanks zo weinig indruk op hen maakt
6104050 de kerk probeert het geloof in bepaalde vormen te gieten maar het gevaar is dat ze die vormen gaat verabsoluteren
6104051 ze is te veel een instituut en te weinig een beweging ze rekent op volgzaamheid waar ze mensen juist zou moeten uitnodigen om mee te praten en mee te denken het priesterambt is een vriendschapsdienst aan het volk van god en moet geen ambt zijn van autoritaire baasjes
6104052 de kerken houden zich te weinig bezig met wat mensen bezighoudt
6104053 de samenleving is individualistisch geworden mensen zitten opgesloten in hun eigen wereldje en dreigen daarin ten onder te gaan als je alleen maar van vakantie naar vakantie leeft dan heb je een beperkt bestaan dat weinig vreugde geeft mensen zijn te geconcentreerd op zichzelf en dreigen in die beperktheid ten onder te gaan
6104054 al is het moeilijk om in die wereld door te dringen juist daarin kan de boodschap van het evangelie veel betekenen
6104055 wat mijn wereld doorbreekt geeft immers vreugde zoals de vriendschap met een ander die mijn horizon verbreedt zo geeft jezus ons het voorbeeld van een vriendschap die geen grenzen heeft en tot het uiterste gaat het evangelie stelt ons voor de vraag zijn we vooral voor onszelf bezig of staan we echt open voor wat van buiten op ons af komt
6104056 de kerk verkeert in een spanning tussen geloof en cultuur maar moet vooral op zoek gaan naar de dialoog waar we met elkaar praten en naar elkaar luisteren al kent de kerkelijke traditie bepaalde vormen je kunt die niet zo maar aan mensen opleggen ook als er niet meteen een oplossing is zul je toch die spanning moeten aanvaarden en daarover het gesprek moeten aangaan
6104057 omdat de la citeit van de sapienza in het gedrang zo komen door de rede van de rooms katholieke kerkleider
6104058 in de universitaire wereld die talrijke jaren mijn wereld is geweest werd ik steeds gedreven door het zoeken naar de waarheid door een vrijmoedige dialoog en door respect voor wederzijdse standpunten

6104112 we are scrambling on a weekly basis to find physicians to fill emergency room shifts
6104113 prior to the provincial government signing the new master agreement we had no problem getting locums to come in to help
6104114 right now something has to change we have been able to maintain our coverage but if we cant get physicians to help out something has to change we are doing everything in our power but our hands are tied the resources that we have to call upon are limited
6104115 you know what my stand on the hospital issue is and it hasnt changed im optimistic western hospital will remain open
6104116 enough already im tired and dont want to work anymore

6104119 theres quite a drop in price but the last three years have seen record high prices
6104120 if you had looked three years ago at the 10 year average it was 50 cents a pound at 60 cents its 10 cents better than the average 10 year price in 2005
6104121 if prices go down i hurt even if you have the same yield youd still be down by half on your expenses column
6104122 we more or less expected it would drop off we expect when the price gets to a certain peak it drops off and settles for a couple of years
6104123 thats a lot of berries the pei share is so small were at the mercy of bigger growers in maine quebec nova scotia and new brunswick
6104124 all the rain we had helped them the berries and gave them some size
6104125 the rain in the first part of august is generally good for berries
6104126 the season started out dry and we prayed for rain but i guess we prayed too much

6104128 recently approved pesticides have been implicated in massive bee die offs and are the focus of increasing scientific scrutiny
6104129 epa should be evaluating the risks to bees before approving new pesticides but now refuses to tell the public what it knows
6104130 pesticide restrictions might be at the heart of the solution to this growing crisis so why hide the information they should be using to make those decisions
6104131 there is conflicting information about the affects of neonicotinoids on honey bees and different chemicals in this class are known to vary in their toxicity to bees however the epa identifies both imidacloprid and clothianidin as highly toxic to honey bees
6104132 their uses include seed treatments for corn cotton canola and sunflowers foliar sprays of fruit nut and coffee crops granular and liquid drench applications in turf ornamentals fruit crops and in forests
6104133 it has the potential for toxic chronic exposure to honey bees as well as other non target pollinators through the translocation of clothianidin resides in nectar and pollen in honey bees the affects of this toxic chronic exposure may include lethal and or sub lethal effects in the larvae and reproductive effects on the queen
6104134 there is concern about the practice of combining certain insecticides and fungicides
6104135 we do not know that these chemicals have anything to do with colony collapse disorder but they are definitely stressors in the home and in the food sources
6104136 pesticides alone have not shown they are the cause of ccd we believe that it is a combination of a variety of factors possibly including mites viruses and pesticides
6104137 epa needs to help shed some light so that researchers can get to work on this problem this isnt just an issue for farmers this is an issue that concerns us all
6104138 we literally generated whole tubes in the lab from scratch
6104139 the beautiful thing is that you start with one line expand them indefinitely and generate as many as you want
6104140 at this stage the work is very promising but has not progressed to the stage where the cultured cells are fully equivalent
6104141 much more work will yet be needed before this becomes a practical reality
6104142 we are urging the industry to remain vigilant and encouraging keepers to order vaccine as soon as possible
6104143 vaccination is the only way to protect your animals during this high risk period
6104144 we would have liked to have seen cumbria and northumberland enter the zone at the same time as scotland which is likely to be in the vector free period in winter
6104145 however there is small window of opportunity for arrangements to be made to allow trade
6104146 traders can move livestock into scotland now and markets can start making private transactions
6104147 about 30 of stock purchased in at our carlisle market goes into scotland while the same amount of stock is brought from scotland to be shown at the carlisle markets
6104148 some people have moved livestock to provide for specialist sales but extending the zone in the autumn when a lot of stock gets moved is bound to have an effect on markets
6104149 natural habitats could become islands in a sea of development
6104150 corridors for some animals to move about the state will be cut off by roads subdivisions and shopping malls
6104151 florida 2060 a population distribution scenario for the state of florida
6104152 as the state agency whose mission is to manage fish and wildlife resources for their long term well being and the benefit of people it is our responsibility to predict what could happen to the resources we have been charged to conserve it is what people expect of us
6104153 known as endemic species some examples are the florida scrub jay the florida burrowing owl and a roster of lovely plants restricted to tiny habitats in central florida scrub blazing star and pygmy fringe tree among them
6104154 continuing the current trend clearly would be detrimental to wildlife but it also would be detrimental to people
6104155 fishing hunting bird watching all kinds of outdoor activities which brought many of us to florida in the first place would be greatly diminished this affects our quality of life and our economy
6104156 on the contrary i have confidence that floridians will band together to ensure that we do the right thing for our fish and wildlife while boosting our economic growth and quality of life
6104157 but we must bring the best out in people to reach solutions and we must bring virtually all interests to the table to make that happen
6104158 compatible agricultural activity such as cattle ranches and timber operations
6104159 in the years to come we simply arent going to be able to afford to buy all of the land that needs protecting
6104160 well be more effective if we assist folks who own key wildlife habitats to manage and protect their own land
6104161 get involved in land use planning and decision making and become good stewards of the land
6104162 oh sorry i didnt take the time to figure out
6104163 no scientifically i do not believe its a human being until x
6104164 yes i believe it is a human being at x point
6104165 non voleva cedere al flusso di ricordi ed emozioni forse provava un senso di lealt verso la propria storia una cosa accennare a unesperienza usarla come riferimento e analogia ma descrivere il fatto orrendo nei dettagli a estranei che annuiranno e dimenticheranno doveva sembrargli un tradimento del proprio dolore
6104166 throw something away every day be sure to have one of those boxes set for giving to goodwill mark that box with neon paper or something so it doesnt get packed
6104167 i love the idea of tossing something each and every day i can do that for sure we are going to hold off on the
6104168 and wanted to share with you i think this will help us pack up the kitchen if its old or getting old its not going with us to the lake house
6104169 and that is why this merger is going to benefit shareholder value by creating value driven content
6104170 the united states relies extensively upon trusted contractors to uphold the integrity of the medicare system within new jersey and any abuse of that trust will be sharply addressed
6104171 i thought i was going to be supporting john mccain now im sure of it
6104172 with the release of the new platform the emancipation of women may once again become a legitimate political position

6104174 hierzulande wandern solche knorpelst cke bestenfalls in die wurst da aber leber und blutw rste mit schmeckbarem knorpelanteil inzwischen zu raren delikatesse geworden sind vermute ich mal dass sie eher zu hundefutter verarbeitet werden wie auch die meisten innereien ausgel ste knochen h hnerh lse oder die h hnerr cken mit dem b rzel dabei kann man aus all diesen abf llen schmackhafte und gehaltvolle eint pfe ragouts und suppen zubereiten und dies f r wenig geld ungarische rentner die in der regel nicht mehr als umgerechnet 300 euro rente bekommen sind auf so etwas angewiesen und sie leben damit gar nicht so schlecht bei uns bekommen die meisten rentner ein vielfaches ausgezahlt aber das ist angesichts der lebenshaltungskosten so wenig wert dass sie sich kaum mehr als dosen mit hunde bzw katzenfutter leisten k nnen
6104175 the economic costs of poor hygiene and sanitation in indonesia reached an estimated us 6 3 billion or 2 3 percent of gdp in 2006 according to a new report
6104176 markets are much more interested in the moments in demand and the fact that some were about to go into a recession means that prices havent reacted as strongly as they would have done otherwise
6104177 the pipeline from azerbaijan delivers at the moment around a million barrels a day which is significant given that world oil prices are really set around the margins of the market in other words small amounts of supply can have a big impact on the price
6104178 these groups who say we are fun thats like a grey shadow on the east berlin wall haircut 100 are closer to dean martin than the sex pistols theyre pre punk
6104179 theyre all tribal its this new pop that says vote reagan
6104180 a rope skipping exercise played when two ropes are turned in eggbeater fashion while the ropes are turned a third person jumps within
6104181 malcolm mclaren was very stimulating person a completely bonkers very odd man not quite the evil svengali hes painted as hes so chock a block with ideas he cant stick with one of them particularly long and thats his weakness
6104182 the record industry instead of accepting that the chart is a value ensures that it becomes the value
6104183 you cannot communicate without sensationalism because the entire nations media relies on sensationalism
6104184 there have been murmurings about white doing a soul album and i guess if bowie is accepted into that category then so should ramshackled be
6104185 if you put a nice bright cymbal sound in the fairlight it would come out with all the treble shaved off so it gives this muffled sound to everything
6104186 we dont really have songs so you have to find hook lines in drum sounds and construct different structures
6104187 hes very bright and he makes all kinds of connections and allusions we were almost a band by mistake
6104188 the art of noise comes from an early decision of mine that i hate pop groups
6104189 a lot of groups are well stupid and yet theyre suddenly in this position of being able to talk a lot about life and the world and themselves and they havent got a clue
6104190 a hybrid of the kind of disco records i had heard in the gay clubs but with a significant rock edge to it
6104191 melodic straightforward dance music thats not too funky zingy and pretty but powerful
6104192 bbc radio 1 disc jockey mike read was playing the record on his show when he noticed the mild sexual imagery used as a design on the front cover including one of the more salacious quotes from the lyrics
6104193 frankie was a monster no one could imagine what he demanded of his nephew

6104195 youve got to enjoy it first and its a buuuuuuuuuz if other people enjoy it
6104196 condemn me history will absolve me singing thisll be the day that i die
6104197 a few weeks ago on bbc4 there was a documentary on british b movies which included a clip from
6104198 look at me ma on top of the world weve made it out of liverpool

6104200 songs manacle and its demonic charge the original breath the whisper of unremitting demand
6104201 i was acting almost like the artist and steve lipson was almost like the producer
6104202 i was having all the mad ideas and he was executing them
6104203 all that has happened is that gary langan and i started something it was taken away and we have taken steps to get it back
6104204 the contract was based on english law and included plenty of clauses to say it in plain english it was crap the contract guaranteed us ridiculous fees we understood perfectly that we could hardly afford trevor horn as a producer it was clearly our own naivety but we really wanted trevor as our producer we didnt have a clue about all the clauses the only thing that was absolutely clear to us was that weve been exploited we have signed and had the moral backing but we didnt have any start appointment for a single or an lp plenty of time passed again without anything happening and because of this we also experienced finnacial problems although weve been the first band which signed with ztt the label preferred art of noise and we had to wait in the second row in the brand new studio a whole year passed from the very first contact till it really started because of the waiting period no real band feeling developed michael wasnt officially a member of the band yet because only four of us a kind of abba formation has signed the contract
6104205 at a certain point trevor horn became overstrained with too much work
6104206 weve got to make the marketplace a more exciting place for everyone to be
6104207 i think at ztt we wanted to sell millions of records but feel that there was a reason why we wanted such a thing
6104208 even if we couldnt quite articulate that reason even if it was just some kind of oldfashioned belief that the quality of the product counts
6104209 for nine weeks i was in the whirlwind of my life then i woke up and george michael was 1 with careless whispers fucking hell what was all that for then you wanted to feel youd hand over and john coltrane would be 1 but that was just a personal fantasy
6104210 in the coming age of automation man might be forced to confront himself with the true spiritual problems of living
6104211 moderne rationale phytopharmaka sind in ihrer pharmazeutischen qualit t und ihrer wirksamkeit chemisch synthetischen medikamenten mindestens gleichzusetzen
6104212 warum wir heute in osteuropa und vor allem in russland so erfolgreich sind liegt zum teil auch daran dass wir dort gleiche wettbewerbsbedingungen f r chemisch synthetische medikamente und f r phytotherapeutika haben rzte und patienten entscheiden daher nach rationalen kriterien wirksamkeit sicherheit unbedenklichkeit und kosten
6104213 sondern f r einen wirkstoff mit nur einem hersteller einen vertrag aushandeln
6104214 ich habe als student auch immer gedacht ob diese praktischen rzte berhaupt medizin machen wir haben dar ber gelacht wie die fehldiagnosen machen
6104215 ich bin ich da berfragt weil ich nicht verfolgt habe wie ein allgemeinmediziner wirklich arbeitet
6104216 wir haben leitfadengest tzte qualitative interviews gew hlt um den interviewpartnern auch die m glichkeiten zu geben die gespr che m glichst offen zu gestalten
6104217 lange bevor sie berhaupt mit der allgemeinmedizin in ber hrung kommen
6104218 eine kommilitonin tendiert stark zur p diatrie ein anderer kommilitone m chte in die unfallchirurgie dagegen ist ein allgemeinmediziner bis jetzt noch gar nicht aufgetaucht
6104219 es bringt nichts das hohelied der haus rztlichen versorgung zu singen wenn die studierenden selbst das fach gar nicht praktisch erfahren
6104220 die allgemeinmedizin vorlesung hat dazu beigetragen dass ich gesagt habe das ist kein richtiges fach das ist alles nur humbug ich bin eines besseren belehrt worden in meinem blockpraktikum die vorlesung ist grauenvoll ich habe danach gedacht allgemeinmediziner sind gescheiterte rzte da bin ich froh dass ich im blockpraktikum noch viel dazugelernt habe
6104221 bei vielen ist die bereitschaft nicht vorhanden f r andere da zu sein
6104222 then youre growing biggger as big as u can be
6104223 its not been instant and immense fame but i am a very satisfied person today
6104224 now mr paul gadd said he is ready to leave thailand
6104225 officials concerned are working through the process of putting him on the plane to take him out of the country but if he continues to refuse to leave then he will be confined in the airport transit area temporarily before being taken into a detention centre
6104226 cinderelly cinderelly your skirt goes right up to your belly
6104227 they will not have to go to a re education camp at least for now the order stated but their movement will be restricted and they are likely to face other requirements if they violate any provisions of the order or other regulations however they could be sent to a labor camp
6104228 some of the people in the neighborhood have the homes that their grandparents or

6104230 m glichst sichere preisg nstige verbraucherfreundliche effiziente und umweltvertr gliche leitungsgebundene versorgung der allgemeinheit mit elektrizit t und gas
6104231 some of the people in the neighborhood have the homes that their grandparents or
6104232 guys understand that for the betterment of the game weve got to keep our feelings intact but once you pull on the australian jumper and see the ball you just never know whats going to happen i guess
6104233 so its just a sense of obviously pull yourself back at times but when the balls there in your area as competitive as all of us guys are usually we just go 100 per cent and you just see what happens
6104234 none of us go out there to intentionally hurt an irish player its just a contrast in the sports
6104235 being professional we are a lot stronger than what they are whereas they probably read the game a lot better
6104236 when you pull on that australian jumper its a weird sort of feeling you sort of get that sense of playing for your country and youve got the whole country looking at you so it is pretty fiery
6104237 i think in the last series the irish gave as good as they got but i suppose with all the press that came along with what happened with the last series we might have to tone it down a little bit
6104238 the big difference is that we now have a specialist full time scrum coach in michael foley who has been working with us for the past 18 months
6104239 ryan obviously gives us a few things especially since hes a backrower that will play 80 minutes and theres not many of them
6104240 but jeremys been playing great all year though he probably wont get the 80 minutes and sikas been going very well
6104241 itll be a camp situation itll be a bit of a change of environment a change of surroundings for the players and hopefully that will help freshen things up
6104242 but we didnt want to play penrith have a bus trip back to the airport and then fly and do the same thing two days later
6104243 the big difference is that we now have a specialist full time scrum coach in michael foley who has been working with us for the past 18 months
6104244 there are a few drops where you have to ride on them should be very difficult
6104245 the course isnt the problem but the heat might be
6104246 the course suits me and im excited i dont mind the changes in the course im happy with it this way i had a very good season and im hoping for a medal
6104247 i just did my best its a lot of work and i just try to get better and better
6104248 i dont feel any pressure i just enjoy my ride ive been racing since i was five years old thats almost 16 years
6104249 nothing is broken and he is planning on racing tomorrow
6104250 we are happy with our progress and we are excited about the growth during a cooler economy and during an election year i expect to continue to see increased growth over the coming months and years as more boomers and investors get closer to retirement look to truly diversify and shift a portion of their funds out of the market and into the local real estate market
6104251 sunwest trust envisages further boom after record breaking performance as boomers seek to truly diversify their retirement
6104252 in the minds of most people you rarely spend money to get nothing done
6104253 but in government people often spend vast sums of money to make sure nothing happens at all
6104254 but to say nothings happened because of this money i dont agree with that
6104255 people have absorbed the fact that its a real crisis and it will take complicated solutions to solve
6104256 i think the biggest challenge for us is going to come from within the team
6104257 we work hard but compared to the way the british work we are amateurs
6104258 in 2008 were operating the same way we did in 1991 at the national coaching centre hyeres theres a coach a part time assistant and thats it
6104259 we have all the specialists you like in france but theres no money to pay for them
6104260 im surprised that some other nations didnt even match their worlds performance let alone show a progression
6104261 thats something we will have to look at we need to get riders together for a longer period of time
6104262 it has made a lot of teams sit up and take notice
6104263 but its not just the money its about the way you manage it even with half the budget they would still get the same results
6104264 even though weve put in 110 percent effort were effectively trailing britain by two olympiads
6104265 weve worked as hard as anyone else over the last three years with what we have we cant do any better
6104266 it certainly doesnt get monotonous for me i can tell you
6104267 its a very british thing to worry are we winning too much
6104268 there were never any grudges to bear in waratah land it was a big part of what i did and where i came from for a number of years so to be back is quite nice
6104269 four years ago is a long time ago and if you bear grudges for that long youd go a grey man its done and dusted
6104270 the kicking is important but that aspect of it working with the wingers and fullbacks excites me because i think matts experience as a player in those positions is just invaluable
6104271 we want to try and maximize the potential of our players particularly our wingers and fullbacks both in attack and defence and i think theres a lot that matt will bring to the table in that area
6104272 goalkicking wise it wasnt really good this year for myself pretty difficult but when he burke is on board it kind of gives you a little bit of confidence
6104273 i think the waratahs are going on a tour of fiji later this year so hopefully i can maybe get on that and then put my hand up for a spot on the wallabies spring tour at the end of the year
6104274 the big difference is that we now have a specialist full time scrum coach in michael foley who has been working with us for the past 18 months
6104275 hes brought a lot to this football club and in time you guys will get to speak to the younger players about mark johnson and his time here and theyll be full of praise
6104276 not for one moment do i regret picking him up
6104277 young cale morton i might take him out for a milkshake
6104278 i understand clubs and how they have to entertain players woo them and look at trying to re establish their own list its how its done
6104279 im not going to get into chris because ive got a good relationship with chris and hes trying his damndest to get that footy club up and running and he appears to be doing a terrific job in many areas
6104280 i think what we do have to be careful of is we dont want to go down the track of other codes and you should be able to read into what i say about that
6104281 the big difference is that we now have a specialist full time scrum coach in michael foley who has been working with us for the past 18 months
6104282 if not it will come down to a decision from the players
6104283 our position is that we cant recommend that our players should tour pakistan
6104284 our safety concerns are very much based on the report that was supplied by the icc and the report of the fica world players body commission which the pakistan board has and the report that reg dickason completed for cricket australia
6104285 we have considerable reservations as do our players and the australian cricketers association
6104286 the icc understands the considerable reservations that we new zealand england south africa and perhaps some others hold
6104287 we have been advised that they icc will meet on the 20th of august to consider that situation
6104288 were hoping that the icc will give us some advice some sort of certainty within the next 24 hours about what the next step in this process is
6104289 hopefully that will allow greater clarity about whats going on and we can all get on with making the decisions that we need to make
6104290 we will not put them in a situation if we get specialist advice that tells us that its not safe to do that
6104291 the security advice does not give us any great encouragement at the moment
6104292 we discussed with them our concerns about the advice that we have got on security which would appear to be contrary to their advice to us and we are waiting now for their response
6104293 if it comes to pass that it is suggested we go to sri lanka then we would need to have a look at that issue on the same basis that we have looked at the pakistan issue
6104294 as far as we are concerned the tournament continues in pakistan
6104295 sri lanka has its own set of problems we havent been through the process of analysing them yet
6104296 the big difference is that we now have a specialist full time scrum coach in michael foley who has been working with us for the past 18 months
6104297 we just didnt turn up on the day and hopefully thats something that wont happen again this year
6104298 its given us that big wake up call that we needed
6104299 we were disappointed with ourselves and thought we were a better team than that
6104300 what was worse than him hasler ripping in is he didnt say much
6104301 its like when youre a kid and you want your parents to blow up to let you know it was wrong but when they say im just disappointed in you it hurts even more
6104302 you get scared almost he was just thoroughly disappointed which we all were
6104303 its just a title where you are recognised as the most consistent side and youve played the most consistent footy all year
6104304 we just want to win the next three games the cheque doesnt come into it
6104305 i think back to back losses makes anyone cranky and im sure des will have them cranky and theyll be ready to play
6104306 the big difference is that we now have a specialist full time scrum coach in michael foley who has been working with us for the past 18 months
6104307 they dont have insight on how bad losses are going to get
6104308 its not a pyramid scheme its multi level or network marketing
6104309 surgery was always the last resort but unfortunately thats what it came down to
6104310 i am also shattered that i cant lead the australian davis cup team in chile in our bid to rejoin the world group and hope that the boys can still come through with a great win
6104311 i am looking forward to playing again in january in my home country and using that as a springboard to compete at my best again on the world stage for at least a couple of more years
6104312 if i play a full calendar then i know where i can be in the world and thats all that really matters
6104313 obviously the guys ive lost to since i started at the french open have been the top four players in the world
6104314 so i probably havent had the kindest draws but thats what happens when youre not seeded as well
6104315 the big difference is that we now have a specialist full time scrum coach in michael foley who has been working with us for the past 18 months
6104316 daniels in contract and everyone seems to be pointing the bone at us with daniel
6104317 i think hes a fantastic player hes 25 years of age but he is contracted to the west coast eagles i dare say hell probably finish his career at west coast
6104318 but i do like watching daniel play so if west coast said he was available wed sit down and have a look see what they wanted and wed go from there if we could do the deal
6104319 weve got an idea of our deficiencies and a pretty good idea of where we need to improve so wed be pretty open to whatever was put on the table
6104320 weve got hampson and kreuzer that are going to grow into men but we need to be mindful that we cant ask boys to do a mans job week in week out
6104321 we could really let ourselves down if we think thats it cue in the rack oh well weve done a pretty good job and be happy well no
6104322 this competition goes for 22 weeks and the standards we set will have a big imprint on 2009
6104323 the big difference is that we now have a specialist full time scrum coach in michael foley who has been working with us for the past 18 months
6104324 that was the only way i could talk my wife into it no one thought i had a chance
6104325 suddenly we went from 4 percent in the polls to 33 percent i was running against a group of people who had a lifetime of experience in politics and i had run a few bars
6104326 weve had a couple of tough years and we could use a little extra sales tax so spend a lot of money
6104327 those two guys have kicked a lot of goals each they are the real two key focal points for them
6104328 we have got young defenders that will have those big challenges
6104329 its looking at what eric mackenzie and beau wilkes have shown over the last few weeks and theyve taken up some big challenges and performed very well
6104330 its a pretty bad cork and its right in his buttock running into his hamstring and his hamstring was sore anyway so its sort of linked to that
6104331 in the last game he played he complained of a sore hamstring and then got the cork so its a bit of both
6104332 your greatest learning comes from looking at the toughest things not the nice easy things but looking at the things that are shortcomings and areas of improvement
6104333 the big difference is that we now have a specialist full time scrum coach in michael foley who has been working with us for the past 18 months
6104334 the big difference is that we now have a specialist full time scrum coach in michael foley who has been working with us for the past 18 months
6104335 everyone knows what happened a couple of weeks ago and our forms turned
6104336 everyone knows what happened a couple of weeks ago and our forms turned around since then
6104337 weve got a pretty young group and all the young kids have got a lot of confidence at the moment
6104338 so the coaches will try to bring that into the game and let the boys play the way they play and use their confidence and a bit of flair to hopefully get us over the line
6104339 weve just got to stick to our structures we do match up pretty well against sydney
6104340 hopefully we just keep doing the things weve been doing and things will hopefully fall our way
6104341 hes served his two weeks and he trained pretty strongly today
6104342 obviously hes a great runner hes one of those players that breaks the lines for us so im assuming hes available for selection
6104343 im very good mates with al so obviously i want him to stay id love him to play at collingwood for the rest of his career
6104344 going out to kids schools and the stuff he does off his own bat and helping out his mates kids and that sort of stuff you never hear about that
6104345 the big difference is that we now have a specialist full time scrum coach in michael foley who has been working with us for the past 18 months
6104346 i am grateful for my breath and the recognition that i am here alive breathing i am grateful for life and for this time alone in this moment i have to do nothing yes there are many things that need to get done but in this moment i have to do nothing
6104347 its not the kind of thing that we in our wildest dreams would expect to happen in our hospitals in our wildest nightmares i guess
6104348 the minutes of augusts mpc meeting might be seen as a touch more hawkish than expected after last weeks inflation report

6104352 summer of 69 by bryan adams dunno if it in sync with the tune you guys need to tell me
6104353 its really a transition from what it used to be like in the 90s it used to be a two tier system here in canada it would take about two years to hire someone who wasnt canadian we had to do a complete search advertise in papers and so on for someone from canada and then only when that was exhausted could we look for a foreign academic then it was often too late theyd be snatched up
6104354 now that we have our lawyers the process is really smooth
6104355 the immigration officer referred my husband and me to lawyers in toronto to take care of all the paperwork involved with immigration the whole process was very confusing and it would have been very difficult to do on our own basically they provided everything we needed to land as immigrants and all we had to do is provide them information to fill out the forms
6104356 i wanted a good quality of life along with academic rigor i was also impressed with utsc and the quality of the management program
6104357 the university of toronto strives to be the best research and teaching university in canada and as such we need to compete on the international market for new faculty

6104365 i didnt think i would lift him so easy because hes such a big bloke

6104400 weve learned that nvidia is working hard to launch gt200 55nm but this will most certainly wont happen in august or september our sources imply that this will take place in q4 2008 nvidia simply wants to win the performance crown back from r700 adding gddr5 memory and 55nm process will certainly speed things up and they will take the dissipation down thermal dissipation is nvidias biggest problem as the chip turns to be extremely hot and the new 55nm should be a bit better once you take care of thermals you can clock the chip higher which eventually means more performance the 55nm process with a new clock and gddr5 memory should get gt200 55nm a bit faster than r700 and this is exactly what nvidia needs

6104412 this is the peak time for the transmission of west nile
6104413 we expect an increase in the number of cases reported to us in early september because it takes about two weeks for symptoms to show up now is the time to be taking precautions
6104414 higher numbers of positive tests indicate that west nile virus is becoming more prevalent in the environment increasing the chances of being bitten by an infected mosquito
6104415 while it has only been detected in a few counties west nile can probably be found in every county this time of year
6104416 but they will help us improve our education efforts around vector borne diseases in new hampshire
6104417 interestingly the percentage of individuals who use the various protection methods does not appear to differ by region of the state
6104418 even though the risk is very different among regions this is good because the message is getting everywhere but we want to make sure that those at higher risk are always taking precautions of the people who never use repellent 22 said it was because of concern about negative health effects and we need to do a better job reassuring people of the safety of approved repellents when they are used properly our best chance at reducing risk includes being diligent in our practices and using multiple methods to prevent mosquito and tick bites and the diseases they cause changing behaviors is never easy but these steps are the cornerstone of protecting ourselves from these diseases
6104419 without treatment by a primary care provider chronic health conditions get progressively worse and people end up in the emergency room
6104420 the data in this report present the issues but the solutions like early detection of chronic disease and health education rest within the community

6104434 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative

6104437 the lovers in the gargoyle have the intimacy of roommates who hook up when they get drunk not a time defying passion their thoughts feelings conversations and affections are so unformed so hampered by sentiment and under powered awkwardness that the courage endurance and under standing ascribed to them seem silly davidsons lovers are dysfunctional and quirky qualities that can look a bit like profundity from a distance but they dont have emotional or imaginative depth or range which at the end of the day are the only things that can make a love story deep and wide ranging
6104438 west has made 15 reporting trips to iraq over the last six years and is almost as personally invested in the current conflict as he was in vietnam this book his third on iraq is his attempt to ensure that the endgame in iraq turns out better than in his last war
6104439 sharp as he can be in his judgments he is equally sharp in identifying the virtues of what he doesnt like he gives a spacious view of the countryside whatever the particular road he hews through it he takes his subjects seriously but not himself like snow white you might say
6104440 i read the suicide index with a rapacity bordering on need with tears in my chest and in my eyes occasionally i had to put it down and leave the room more often i devoured it the book is the product of a loving daughters grief and part of her process of grieving but it is also the measured elegant gripping work of a professional writer who has set her powers of observation to work on her own family her parents and grandparents her uncle her sister her husband her son and on herself

6104443 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
6104444 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
6104445 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
6104446 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
6104447 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
6104448 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
6104449 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
6104450 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks

6104455 were still in the wooden biplane era of cyber war it will get more sophisticated probably quite quickly the us has already created units for cyber defense so too has china no doubt russia and probably many others
6104456 if there had been a world wide web in the days of the blitz then the germans would have been attacking us on the net as well as from the air and wed have been doing the same back to them
6104457 for example you are physically attacked say bombed then someone screws with your emergency response systems making the situation worse
6104458 a malicious hack can be conducted by an individual or small group
6104459 it also provides a sneaky mechanism to states to attack and cause harm while avoiding retaliation because the identity of the attacker is obscured for instance if the republican of whatsistan launches a missile at you you know with a certainty where it came from not so with cyber
6104460 it costs about 4 cents per machine you could fund an entire cyber warfare campaign for the cost of replacing a tank tread
6104461 it is my hope that reading these stories inspires some to plant their own seeds of change that when we see something wrong well do something about it whether that means writing to your representative in congress or researching a cure for a disease or simply speaking out against inequality and prejudice were all in this together and the first step toward change can begin with any one of us
6104462 there is an increase in targeted attacks on specific pieces of high value information whether that is directors of companies and their personal pension investments or attacking corporate networks to try to take intellectual property ip out of the organization and move it to the developing world

6104466 it is common to talk in the industry about the declining standards and morale at the company since richard hickox started as music director
6104467 the allegations are serious and we are taking them seriously
6104468 i am confident that fiona janes would feel we have engaged seriously with the issues being brought to our attention
6104469 one action that does flow from the meeting is the recommendation that the companys consultative committee be re started to enable the views of key groups such as principal singers orchestral players and technical crew to be heard and exchanged it takes some courage to make criticisms such as these and its not concluded
6104470 often in our business criticism is dismissed as whingeing but theres a lot of truth in whats being said
6104471 without first hearing our side of the story and without providing us with protection to enable us to establish what our rights were and how we were to enforce such rights
6104472 it need hardly be said the investigation of crime will come to a grinding halt our law simply doesnt work that way
6104473 to force the south african government to give up its democratic and capitalistic principles by force
6104474 the exhibits and electronic data seized will be used as evidence in any criminal proceedings against the first applicant and others who may be involved in the commission of the offences
6104475 there are suspects who are out of the country and the exhibits and electronic data seized may be necessary in procuring the arrest and extradition of those suspects

6104479 the new york police department violated core constitutional rights when it arrested a group of peaceful demonstrators who were lawfully protesting against the commencement of the iraq war and those who stood to profit from it
6104480 we are gratified by the citys decision to compensate these individuals whose targeted arrests were without probable cause and intended to quell future protest in new york city this lawsuit and this settlement vindicates our clients rights to assemble and speak their mind free from the fear that they will be punished for their views
6104481 my question is why did the nypd send over 100 police in riot gear along with vehicles to block the street and disrupt the flow of morning rush hour traffic all to stop a legal peaceful protest when there are far more important matters they could be pursuing and why did they fight us in court so doggedly when they knew the evidence proved that we were arrested without any police orders to leave
6104482 we hope our victory helps convince the city to stop violating peoples rights as a matter of policy and stop wasting taxpayers money doing so
6104483 it should also serve as a reminder that washingtons illegal war in afghanistan and iraq is also being fought at home against its own citizens and in the name of war profiteers like carlyle and halliburton we intend to continue our resistance until this stops
6104484 i would like to make music with somebody who makes really funky music
6104485 i want to do a collaboration with somebody who has really different styles than me i am not in a hurry to do that
6104486 i have never done dance but i like it i think its funny if i sing on it because my singing is not funky at all
6104487 i had never thought about it but mainly i sing i dont play guitar i dont play piano well i dont play instruments well so i started to do electronic music
6104488 from the beginning i have been using a sampler because i play everything but not very well so finally i cut into small segments and i sample my playing so it becomes cut and pasted it is like creating my live show in my apartment
6104489 i used to think that having a telephone conversation was normally private but you cant walk down the street without hearing a number of telephone conversations some of them with people speaking loudly because of the noise of the surrounding traffic
6104490 when you look at the kind of information that people publish about themselves it makes you wonder
6104491 i wrote a judgment a few years ago in which i said there seemed to me to be certain things which were self evidently private i am not sure about that any more
6104492 the very changes that are taking place in the concept of privacy will be a matter that parliaments have to address and courts
6104493 the widespread availability of communications technologies that allow individuals to publish information about themselves that can be accessed by others is unprecedented in our society
6104494 people are only now beginning to understand the privacy implications of social networking sites and user generated content it may be that the pendulum will swing away somewhat from the great enthusiasm for disclosure that we are seeing now
6104495 i havent changed my position if its right i will support it

6104509 we are assisting companies meet this challenge by developing e learning modules which incorporate highly effective engagement techniques and interactive scenarios so that users quickly acquire or refresh their knowledge on a particular system change management process or service launch said simon
6104510 our approach to system training is to move beyond the simple online user manual by developing highly engaging training modules
6104511 our emphasis on engagement and interaction with users has proved very effective in system training but our work also includes breaking down company silos through change management and communication focused e learning so staff are much better equipped to understand the business rationale driving new systems or product roll outs

6104526 i know that saccawu will support the need for a peaceful protest
6104527 woolworths maintains that it will give the union appropriate recognition once they have demonstrated that they have sufficient representation
6104528 woolworths has tried very hard to criminalise the pending strike by saccawu members through effectively denying them their right to picket

6104542 being able to work the normal workflow that youre used to with your digital audio work station but getting the true sonic benefits of real tape of a real tape machine of the analog circuitry in the tape machine
6104543 i wanted to be able to use tape cause thats what i started out on i think we all started there and i wanted to get back to the sound of real analog
6104544 i wanted to be able to use tape cause thats what i started out on i think we all started there and i wanted to get back to the sound of real analog
6104545 the only thing that its doing is communicating what the mix engine needs to do to sync things up
6104546 or even a digital headphone distribution system those devices always have some sort of inherent latency that they introduce to the signal path and everybody just kind of deals with it with clasp you can enter that information and itll compensate for that as well
6104547 i figured youve got all these great tape machines that cost tens of thousands of dollars that are just collecting dust and nothing beats the real thing people would love to use tape but the traditional method of using tape is such a headache clasp solves all those problems theres no headaches anymore
6104548 with clasp you can do your entire album with just one reel of tape
6104549 sometimes during sessions weve forgotten that the tape machine was even there youre not paying attention and all of the sudden its rewinding

6104564 if you enemy is hungry feed him if he is thirsty give him something to drink for by so doing you will heap burning coals on his head

6104567 the matthew 25 network is a community of christians catholic protestant pentecostal and evangelical inspired by the gospel mandate to put our faith into action to care for our neighbor especially the most vulnerable
6104568 the election of our public officials and the politics they stand for are a reflection of our core values we believe that those elected to public office carry an important trust as their decisions have a profound impact on our nation and our world
6104569 we believe that people of faith should actively participate in the political process as an important avenue for social change we are called by our faith to engage in the world as it is while we seek after and hope for gods kingdom
6104570 therefore while no elected official will be without flaw we come together as individuals to support candidates for public office who share the values of the matthew 25 network promoting life with dignity caring for the least of these strengthening and supporting families stewardship of gods creation working for peace and justice at home and abroad and promoting the common good
6104571 what do you think this is pathetic and disgusting a waste of taxpayer money with all this nonsense this is a joke

6104576 my dad and mom divorced when i was young and i dont have any brothers or sisters
6104577 divorce is such a sad thing im really grateful mr toberman and i have still been happily married all these years
6104578 well maybe ill be that lucky when i am married
6104579 i wish they would take the extra time to make sure they had all their things before going down to open
6104580 our good friend leroi moore passed on and gave his ghost up today and we will miss him forever
6104581 i find it surprising that people seem to be taking what the candidates say at their word
6104582 he reminded me so much of bush in his delivery i also find his shoot from the hip approach alarmingly similar to bush
6104583 while in the senate mccain voted for the nominations of three of the four supreme court justices he said yesterday he wouldnt have nominated all but stevens
6104584 and that 3 million dollars to spend studying the dna of bears in montana that he brought up he voted for that as well
6104585 as obama mentioned the number of abortions have not gone down in the pro life bush administration
6104586 it is surprising that rather than support people who are actually committed to reducing abortions a pro lifer would want to support someone like mccain who claims the position to win votes but would do absolutely nothing on the issue if in office
6104587 would do absolutely nothing on the issue if in office
6104588 if you look at mccains record you will see that he puts a lot of effort into issues he cares about the war but doesnt have a lot of curiosity on issues he doesnt care that much about the economy
6104589 i seriously seriously doubt there would be any real groundbreaking work on reducing abortions in a mccain presidency
6104590 and the last thing i need is another president who is not curious about issues that impact the american people at the very least obama has that
6104591 come over some day and help me vet the landslide of requests for assistance im receiving
6104592 from working people waiting for the bush tax cuts to benefit them
6104593 the stereotype that those who arent making it just arent working hard enough is simply not my experience
6104594 it took a progressive like teddy roosevelt to get things back in hand and its going to take another progressive to correct the problem again
6104595 die neuen abschl sse sind eine wichtige voraussetzung f r k rzere studienzeiten und geringere abbrecherquoten
6104596 daher sollten bachelor und master bundesweit z gig eingef hrt werden
6104597 in der hightech branche gibt es viele t tigkeiten f r die dieser abschluss eine sehr gute eingangsqualifikation darstellt
6104598 gerade in den technischen f chern sehen viele universit ten den bachelor nur als durchgangsstation zum master
6104599 das verunsichert die schulabg nger und studienanf nger und f hrt unter umst nden zu einer entscheidung gegen das studium
6104600 in vielen anderen positionen sind lebenslange neugier lernbereitschaft und flexibilit t wichtiger als eine lang dauernde hochschulausbildung

6104603 on july 29th i posted that i was going to take part in a photo contest to sum up i am doing it because i feel the need to try something new and different
6104604 dieser wei e raum gar wunderbar und doch so heimisch als ob man nie woanders gelebt h tte wie alt seid ihr
6104605 so alt war meine mutter auch als sie das k chenmesser nahm in die kirche rannte und gott um vergebung bat doch h rte der alte sie nicht er war viel zu sehr damit besch ftigt seine gebote der neuen zeit anzupassen und sie dann zu verk nden
6104606 die beiden sind eh und je und weh und wach doch ich bin zu haben ihr alter schreckt mich nicht ab mein lieber schatz
6104607 oh schau doch nur da sind elefanten an der decke und da ziegen l wen v gel und kamele ich liebe kamele mein vater war eines ich bin leider nicht zu einem kamel geworden dazu war ich wahrscheinlich zu schlecht in mathematik aber das ist ja auch egal wie siehts nun aus alter mann hast du kein interesse an einem matheunf higen halbkamel
6104608 das sind doch keine tiere du dummkopf wo du einen elefanten siehst sehe ich einen riesigen panzer die ziegen die du siehst sind die einst rmenden infanteristen unseres heeres die sogenannten l wen unsere flaks die v gel unsere flieger und die kamelkarawane sind die sch tzengr ben die sich wie kleine adern durch den riesigen k rper aus erde und gestein hindurch ziehen
6104609 lass mich zuerst sonst durftest du immer und ich habe immer schmiere gestanden das ist nicht gerecht
6104610 du sprichst mir von gerechtigkeit mein lieber sind wir nicht soldaten
6104611 wir folgen dem nat rlichen prinzip der selbsterhaltung der der st rker ist nimmt sich das was er will derjenige der schw cher ist muss sich mit dem zufrieden geben was brig bleibt
6104612 mein asthma qu lt mich wieder mein lieber wei t du dass ich schon mehr als 12 jahre in diesem raum warte
6104613 ich warte und warte und warte doch niemand redet hier mit mir kaum kommt ihr in den raum hinein ffnet sich die t r die sich sonst nur ffnet wenn der herr eine zigarette rauchen m chte dann stellt er sich in die mitte des raumes und ignoriert mich
6104614 ich meine ich wei nicht warum ich hier bin und was das hier berhaupt f r ein ort ist damals als ich noch frei herumlaufen konnte die erde unter meinen baren f en f hlen konnte und mit jedem menschen der mir begegnet war sprechen konnte da war ich gl cklich aber jetzt bin ich hier und ich will zur ck muss ich noch so viel lernen
6104615 bist du denn zum lernen hier ich glaube die zeit des lernens ist vorbei die zeit des vergessens bricht an du musst nichts mehr hinzulernen was dir damals als wichtig erschien nein mathematik ist nicht das was eine seele auszeichnet auch nicht die tatsache ob man nach seinem vater oder seiner mutter kommt was n tzt dir zu wissen dass du ein halbkamel bist was bringt dir eine unterhaltung mit mir dem pf rtner
6104616 ah du bist also der pf rtner welche pforte bewachst du denn die ins reich der kamele
6104617 it is funny you mention this i believe i am the only member of the l g a who has seen johnny since his departure from toronto
6104618 after taking a 40 dollar cab ride across san francisco to meet johnny in a funky haight ashbury style cafe next to his office i have to say that he didnt seem himself at the time i thought the most effective way to cheer up my dawg was to invite him to an intimate performance by the tragically hip you know something is a miss when j l turns down the opportunity to see gord downie with one of his dawgs at a venue that seats less than 500
6104619 i dont understand the leadership of the lga my brother has been the most loyal and committed member of the lga for over 10 years that new chairman clearly doesnt understand what it means to have responsibilities and a family i heard that he didnt even invite my brother to his legendary maxim christmas party based on these commitments thats total bush league
6104620 the ironman is bullx stiff lost his iron man status 2 years ago at the 06 fall classic when he didnt show up for the party in niagara falls i say if you cant get sauced your ironman status is lost some people think the lga is all about golf
6104621 but from my view the lga stands for lets get annihilated now i dont know if just its coincidence but when stiff showed up for the 08 champions dinner everyone was passed out in bed by 10 30pm wasting prime party energy playing pond hockey thats just bad party karma
6104622 the ironman is very simple and scientific if you cant record a score in my online siebel based trend tracking scoring system you cant track attendance all this emotional bs is ridiculous
6104623 stiff should be more worried about his ability to hold onto scorecards than his ironman status its interesting that our fall classic scorecards always seem to go missing when stiff has a good round seems like handicap rigging in my book
6104624 you know its been a tough season coming off the high of winning the fall classic i didnt want to let it affect my game so i decided to take some time off and focus on my family outside of that any time ive got i need to spend here working on the muffin i dont have time to golf as for the ironman i have no comment
6104625 it seems the golf gods might be telling him to put down the spatula give alyssa back her capris and pick up the putter
6104626 blackberrys are so 5 years ago kenny was talking about opening a car mechanics shop when i was working my blackberry like that
6104627 matts work has been great but hes had a little trouble with the new slimming outfits hes wearing
6104628 hes been regularly setting off peoples gaydar around the office and this has been creating some tension
6104629 me and some of the guys are going for a non fat half caf ice frap straight up with a twist theyre soooo good
6104630 sorry i havent got back to you uhm im really not on email much these days and my phone has been acting up theres actually quite a few dead cell zones around the city and my caller id has been on the fritz i also lost my phone for a while there too and had to get a new one
6104631 the fact he won it is a total fluke he is like the philadelphia phillies one shot winners both of them always have the talent but both are always a mess between the ears and lost in the clubhouse
6104632 he is more concerned about ensuring that his shirt and slacks are perfectly pressed for the cameras rather then spending time to determine which club is the correct one to select from his golf bag
6104633 just look at him hes got the charm of lefty the dexterity of a sergio and the je ne sais quoi of a jiminez my work is done here
6104634 i dont know what hes thinking you cant change the spots on a dalmation
6104635 he running it like a bridge club amy and patti have looked into joining
6104636 jeffs running the lga to emulate his golf game slow calculated and far from colourful or exciting
6104637 jeffs got to stop acting like a 45 year old man
6104638 johnathon hud is jumping on me again you need to take care of him
6104639 crap this interviews over my wife makes me give my dog an hj so he stops mauling her it aint no freakin picnic
6104640 his youthful enthusiasm has been a breath of fresh air since he started earlier this year its the highlight of my week when he comes
6104641 when he sold me on fat free lactose free caramel vanilla liquid coffee mate to the benefit and appreciation of the local
6104642 rusty just needs to have confidence in his game and grow some balls
6104643 i can go proudly back to my hometown and tell my people that i have not let them down their dream came true and my goal was achieved
6104644 it showed the improvement of the overall level of chinese sailing
6104645 the medal race was really classic and it will be definitely recorded into the history of chinese sailing
6104646 it was a dream of the girls to win an
6104647 it is a breakthrough for china in this weight category because no chinese have won a gold in this before
6104648 i have been waiting for this day for a long time

6104660 some of this anthrax may and i emphasize may have come from iraq
6104661 encouraged him and told him he had brought pride to
6104662 when i heard the news i wept with joy it was so great
6104663 i received so many phone calls i was unable to answer them every taekwondo practitioner wanted to express their happiness for the ever for afghanistan
6104664 this opens a new window to the world for taekwondo and also for other sports in afghanistan
6104665 now we pray for my brother we are confident that he will also win a medal
6104666 its a critical time for the vaquita and the mexican government has stepped up to the plate
6104667 obviously some kind of mechanism kicks in for the boys
6104668 between the age of 2 and 7 they actually learn language faster than girls after age 7 boys and girls stay on the same trajectory
6104669 for children who are still late talkers in school it is important to provide early intervention and enrichment
6104670 parents should contact a speech pathologist if they have any concerns
6104671 in our large and diverse sample children in families with limited means have as good a chance at starting to talk as those in families with lots of resources
6104672 the polyketal microparticles we developed are simply a vehicle to get the drugs inside the body to the diseased area as quickly as possible
6104673 the major advantage to using these polyketals to deliver drugs is that they degrade into biocompatible compounds that dont accumulate in a patients tissue or cause additional inflammation
6104674 we think these microparticles are going to be fantastic for oral drug delivery because they can survive the stomach conditions before they release their contents in the intestines
6104675 patients with acute liver failure need drugs as soon as possible or else theyll die
6104676 weve tailored the polyketals hydrolysis rates to deliver the drug in one or two days
6104677 delivering proteins inside microparticles has been limited because getting the protein into the microparticles required organic solvents that frequently destroyed the proteins
6104678 to overcome this problem we developed a method of simply immobilizing the protein on the surface of the microparticles
6104679 although yeast can derive energy from a lot of different carbon sources such as fatty acids and different kinds of sugars yeast really really like glucose the sugar found in honey
6104680 thats what they will use if its there even if its there only in trace amounts
6104681 how do you get yeast to give up their habit of using only glucose no matter what else is around
6104682 yeast essentially care about glucose because they are genetically programmed that way not because there is any physiological reason they have to care about glucose
6104683 we can genetically change that program we are using genetics to modify yeast strains so that they will use other sugars just as well as glucose
6104684 you get a lot more ethanol for the same amount of work
6104685 honey i am leaving tomorrow to go overseas i dont know how long i will be gone or exactly where i am going but i want you to know that i love you always
6104686 it is amazing how similar the image scores appear to be for both barack obama and john mccain if obama is this agent of change that america has been waiting for why is his image no better than the nominee from the other party a political party whose brand is supposed to be so badly damaged
6104687 voters are looking for change that gives obama a real advantage in this election even as mccain tries to reinvent himself among undecided voters obama has a decided advantage in being better liked this poll also modeled a traditional electorate however obama has the ability to change the electorate simulating modest gains in youth turnout takes the ballot to a 2 point advantage for obama changing the face of the electorate is obamas ace in the hole
6104688 the candidates will use the upcoming conventions to reinforce their positive and comparative messages this survey acts as an important benchmark going into the remaining weeks of the campaign which includes the vice presidential picks acceptance speeches and three scheduled debates
6104689 the positive re evaluation of john mccain is the untold story of the last three months of this election john mccains biggest comparative gain over the last three months has come on the issue of gas and energy prices
6104690 obama has a decisive advantage on the economy and domestic agenda for the middle class that will determine this election among voters overall he is ahead 9 points on the economy and 15 points on being for the middle class among undecided voters obama is ahead 12 points and 27 points respectively that should translate into decisively taking the undecided voters
6104691 it is an honor to be part of such a dynamic and productive organization being an lcaa board member represents a fantastic opportunity for me to give back to my alma mater and maintain an active relationship with the amazing community that is lakeland college
6104692 i feel fortunate for this opportunity to continue my relationship with lakeland college and can only hope that my involvement will somehow serve to make a positive impact on the school and all those involved in its academic success
6104693 lakeland was my home away from home to be a part of helping keep the alumni connected to our school is a blessing to me being on the alumni board will keep me connected to a school that i will cherish forever and give me a chance to see people that are close to my heart
6104694 i joined the board to give back to lakeland for how much lakeland gave to me
6104695 reconnecting witnessing and hopefully helping contribute in some small way to all the great things propelling lakeland into the 21st century
6104696 dying as a martyr is my ambition my dream and my hope
6104697 if god wills that i be executed by infidels including hypocrites and apostates because i am fighting jihad in the way of god then that means that my greatest ambition has been achieved
6104698 before i thought the execution could be carried out before the fasting month but not anymore
6104699 theyre not afraid and are ready to die as martyrs
6104700 i want you to go to the window open it stick your head out and yell im as mad as hell and im not going to take this anymore

6104703 certainly consumers need to understand what a standard drink is

6104709 in silence we close off our souls from sounds whether those sounds be noise music or words
6104710 silence goes beyond solitude and without it solitude has little effect
6104711 hearing is said to be the last of our senses to go at death sound always strikes deeply and disturbingly into our souls so for the sake of our souls we must seek times to leave our television radio tape players and telephones turned off
6104712 in witnessing the role of talking is frequently overemphasized does that sound strange its true silence and especially true listening are often the strongest testimony to our faith a major problem in christian evangelism is not getting people to talk but to silence those who through their continuous chatter reveal a loveless heart devoid of confidence in god
6104713 how few of us live with quiet inner confidence and yet how many of us desire it
6104714 only silence will allow us life transforming concentration upon god
6104715 when were with those we feel less than secure with we use words to adjust our appearance and elicit their approval otherwise we fear our virtues might not receive adequate appreciation and our shortcomings might not be properly understood in not speaking we resign how we appear dare we say how we are to god
6104716 i will guard my ways that i may not sin with my tongue i will guard my mouth as with a muzzle

6104718 the lifeblood of our business is r amp d spend
6104719 what has happened was that many goods have been smouldering since then and we have been monitoring the situation
6104720 smoke inhalation could be dangerous and it makes sense to evacuate the scene
6104721 we are trying to push the players to use skirts and also nicer shirts not the shirts that are made for men but ones with more curves

6104726 the towns it girl journalist sara is the tara palmer thompkinson of harrisburg
6104727 if sara ever runs for political office shell have my vote
6104728 when the harrisburg young professionals were founded it was with people like sara in mind
6104729 kudos to sara bozich of the patriot for providing a bit of buzz about the local posters
6104730 this blog is a well tended garden fed by a clear passion for our city
6104731 youre the voice and embodiment of downtown and harrisburg is lucky to be chronicled by someone with wit and style

6104738 ma perch gridare se laltra persona proprio davanti a te non sarebbe possibile parlare a bassa voce perch gridare proprio quando si arrabbiati

6104740 to have insured nearly a half million people in less than two years is nothing short of remarkable
6104741 the producers said that they wouldnt use the original songs for the remake instead they will be having new songs to feature
6104742 oh really thats a waste of money understand that im not making this as a total comparison but it would be like saying hey lets go remake casablanca you should just leave those things alone
6104743 why would anyone want to do a remake of a cult classic

6104746 a violent education corporal punishment of children in us public schools
6104747 every public school needs effective methods of discipline but beating kids teaches violence and it doesnt stop bad behavior
6104748 corporal punishment discourages learning fails to deter future misbehavior and at times even provokes it
6104749 minority students in public schools already face barriers to success
6104750 by exposing these children to disproportionate rates of corporal punishment schools create a hostile environment in which these students may struggle even more
6104751 by understanding the political preferences of these voter groups its indicative of socio economic impact on political preferences and indecisions perhaps mccain should consider a bus tour through wal mart parking lots and obama could use target

6104974 they didnt bother to tell patients that organs had been offered
6104975 the demand had just grown far beyond what they could do
6104976 if we could have actually put the power to see that data and see that information in the hands of the allocation analysts we might have been able to stop that situation
6104977 our main goal was to put reporting in the hands of our business users

6104992 this cant be real someone must have read an unshelved comic and misunderstood
6104993 remember e t he ate those peanut butter candies and got really sick you have to be careful what you eat too so that something like that doesnt happen
6104994 a case could be made for an immediate increase for a cut or for maintaining the bank rate at the current level
6104995 in each case there were arguments in favor and against
6104996 the boe continues to view the path of least resistance of keeping interest rates on hold as the most preferable route to take for now implying rate easing is not just around the corner despite a significant deterioration in the u k economic outlook
6104997 we believe that the first rate cut is only likely to come early next year once it has become clear than cpi inflation has peaked
6104998 however the prevailing mood seems to suggest that blanchflower will find a few more allies as we move towards the end of the year as bad news on growth and employment continues to pile up on the dove half of the scales
6104999 it is a case of when not if the bank cuts interest rates
6105000 we expect the first cut to come in november assuming growth disappoints relative to the banks expectations these minutes support that view
6105001 but we also suspect that the recent collapse in energy and commodity prices after a period of reflection may also have prompted a modification in view
6105002 and we extend this point to the rest of mr besleys colleagues on the mpc

6105015 it is disheartening to watch us airways top executives enrich themselves with performance based stock awards while flight attendants continue to work under a bankruptcy driven contract that slashed wages and eliminated pensions and benefits
6105016 while us airways has improved its on time performance the airline still ranks number one in customer complaints which makes it even harder to justify this performance bonus
6105017 while management has every right to award themselves performance based stock grants it is a slap in the face to the hard working flight attendants who are facing job losses and have not received a simple cost of living increase in almost six years it is also an affront to the passengers being nickel and dimed for such comforts as a glass of water when will corporate america understand the devastating effects of this erosion on public and employee moral and trust
6105018 jai is the perfect addition to a city that already celebrates diversity and a variety of cultures
6105019 both the menu and dining room design are fun contemporary and rich with flavor just like la jolla playhouse we are excited to partner with them to offer san diegans the opportunity to enjoy fresh asian cuisine along with the performing arts
6105020 we disagree with the administration that the endangered species act isnt a perfectly appropriate act to address global warming
6105021 the pika is very much the polar bear of the lower 48
6105022 the pika is the american wests canary in the coal mine
6105023 as temperatures rise pika populations at lower elevations are being driven to extinction pushing pikas further upslope until they have nowhere else to go
6105024 its critical they be able to cross in and out of the park
6105025 some of these species i believe with enough time could just blink out
6105026 backcountry sprawl and habitat fragmentation are eating up your winter range
6105027 you can go to every jurisdiction right around the park and youll find that kind of push on the boundaries
6105028 the whitebark pine is essentially gone as a food source for grizzly bears
6105029 the salmon is essentially gone today the berries drive the bears
6105030 im not sure what the bears have left to fall back on
6105031 the interaction between climate and pathogens is sort of a crapshoot
6105032 thats because we still have the potential to preserve some of these linkages
6105033 connectivity is absolutely critical and we have this natural north south pathway called the rocky mountains
6105034 well need to work together and coordinate like never before
6105035 you start melting those places away and you can see how wolverine range contracts
6105036 they could be gone in just a few years once the snow goes
6105037 so when the scientific consensus is one of alarm that should tell you something
6105038 thats one reason we go to parks i think allowing the wildlife room to roam is a goal that every montanan and every glacier park visitor shares we all want our children and grandchildren to enjoy the wildlife that we enjoy
6105039 and i dont think its likely we can make it colder any time soon
6105040 every little area of connectivity is becoming more and more important all the time
6105041 these outside pressures absolutely affect what the park will look like in 100 years
6105042 were chipping away at the available habitat for now glacier is big enough that species are persisting but climate change is making it smaller
6105043 we should always be thinking about outside threats to the park
6105044 but in a time of abrupt climate change we should also be having a very serious conversation about how those threats might interact with other stressors to change glacier park forever
6105045 the results are a direct reflection of the need for more beds and community services
6105046 its got to be evident to everybody that we need more addiction and other services and smaller caseloads for mental health workers so they can provide more intensive treatment in and out of hospitals
6105047 hospitals are doing what they can but beds are at a premium and there is so much pressure to move people out
6105048 it doesnt take a catastrophic mount st helens blow the top off type of eruption to cause problems
6105049 it only takes a little activity to melt snow and ice and start things moving
6105050 some have indicated its really hard to get a foot in the door on state contracts
6105051 it requires working with major contractors and identifying opportunities for subcontracting
6105052 encouraging them to bid working with them if they dont get the bid to tell them what they can do to improve
6105053 the idea is to open the door and create a level playing field
6105054 must be more proactive in including certified minority and women businesses
6105055 if this results in more oregon small businesses getting these contracts its a good thing
6105056 its a reminder to agency directors to make this a priority
6105057 the ghost is not a weapon its a way of life

6105457 hence as we have said only the ties of a friendship which is founded upon similarity of virtuousness are trustworthy and indissoluble for the the lord makes those of one mind to dwell in the house therefore love can abide unbroken only in those in whom there is one chosen orientation and one desire one willing and one not willing if you also wish to preserve this inviolable you must first strive after having expelled your vices to put to death your own will and with common earnestness and a common chosen orientation to fulfill diligently what the prophet takes such great delight dwelling in unity this should be understood not in terms of place but spiritually for it profits nothing if those who disagree about behavior and chosen orientation are together in one dwelling nor is it a drawback to those who are of like virtue to be separated by distance with god it is common behavior rather than a common location that joins brothers in a single dwelling and the fullness of peace can never be maintained where there is a difference of wills

6105501 mijn oudoom is nooit getrouwd en ook zijn broer en zus hadden geen kinderen
6105502 maar via mijn ouders hebben we altijd veel contact met hem gehad begin juni was hij er nog bij op de bruiloft van mijn dochter en in april vierden we uitgebreid zijn tachtigste verjaardag
6105503 nonkel raoul was een liefhebber van franse wijn en ging elke zomer zes zeven weken op reis naar frankrijk normaal gezien kregen we altijd een kaartje maar we hadden vreemd genoeg nog niks ontvangen dit jaar
6105504 de twee zijn vroeger nog samen door frankrijk getrokken en bezochten daar dan altijd een gravin met wie ze bevriend waren blijkbaar had de politie haar adres in de auto gevonden en haar gecontacteerd maar toen het bericht van zijn overlijden ons bereikte was hij dus al begraven
6105505 toen we het nieuws hoorden hebben we onmiddellijk besloten hem naar hier te laten overbrengen maar we hebben wel eerst 2000 euro moeten betalen voor de begrafenis die ginder had plaatsgevonden en voor de kosten van de opgraving uiteindelijk hebben we hem hier een anderhalve maand later de uitvaart kunnen geven die hij verdiende er waren wel driehonderd mensen aanwezig
6105506 we hadden ergens wel gehoopt dat de stad sint niklaas in de kosten zou tussenkomen omdat daar toch wel een serieuze flater is begaan maar uiteindelijk hebben we zelfs geen verontschuldigingen gekregen
6105507 in die fax stond niet dat die man dood was
6105508 onze medewerkers hebben gewoon een antwoord gegeven op de vraag van buitenlandse zaken bz of er directe nabestaanden waren dat bleek niet het geval in onze registers maar in de fax van bz stond ook nergens dat de man dood was laat staan in frankrijk zou begraven worden
6105509 zoiets is nog nooit gebeurd het is waar dat er niet verder naar nabestaanden is gezocht op onze diensten maar ook zonder nabestaanden werden mensen in het verleden altijd gerepatrieerd naar belgi waarom bz daar nu anders over beslist heeft is mij een raadsel
6105510 het is de allereerste keer dat ik hoor dat een landgenoot bij overlijden in het buitenland wordt begraven tenzij hij zelf uitdrukkelijk die wens te kennen heeft gegeven
6105511 die ambtenaar heeft er zich wellicht makkelijk van af gemaakt in de veronderstelling dat niemand aan die nietrepatri ring zou tillen
6105512 bijna alle belgen hebben via hun mutualiteit een aanvullende verzekering medische bijstand in het buitenland die een volledige of gedeeltelijke terugbetaling van een lijkrepatri ring dekt
6105513 even though a person can make up to 20 000 more teaching say in loudon county or even close by in washington county theyre looking at the cost of the commute and i think time is a factor
6105514 we have a thousand dollar bonus for orientation that all new teachers receive also we have a housing allowance and a sick leave bonus so its possible that a first year teacher will make 36 000 starting in berkeley county
6105515 a lot of these permanent subs that we have hired are retired teachers in other disciplines and we have those folks in these hard to find areas

6105642 the hardest thing for a first time candidate to do unless hes already particularly well known in the community for something hes done is to build name id
6105643 dont have to go through the months and months and months of introducing themselves to voters
6105644 an important thing to realize i think is that youre not starting necessarily from where you finished last cycle
6105645 the mistake a candidate can make who got very close last cycle is to assume they start at that point and all they need to do is make up for the 1 000 votes or the 3 000 votes or whatever it is theyre short
6105646 it might be easier to start off with a blank slate than to start off with a guy whos got very high negatives
6105647 theres nothing that will teach you to deal with the media better than dealing with the media you learn that its a bleeping hot stove and it will burn you if you put your hand on it
6105648 the issue matrix is so different this time around and i believe it certainly plays to my strength
6105649 last time kagen ran against the establishment and now he is the establishment
6105650 its kind of like a team that made it to the super bowl and loses but they have that experience of going very far and the next time theyre going to win it
6105651 it was an absolutely fabulous night for our statewide candidates
6105652 they all outperformed what our expectations could have been dino first and foremost
6105653 you cant implificate me this time im up to my floppy ears in afghanistan trying to pacificate those presidentless folks over there
6105654 shoot i concoctified katrina to guarantee me one more term in office i did not have sex with that woman ms nature im still experimentating on a secret mass amnesia event that will allow me to sorta reintroducify myself as the next american messiah that way i can get reelected all over gain for the first time ive codenamed the project operation forget me not no wait operation forget me no wait oh just forget it
6105655 it honors the hard work of so many people who supported sen clinton
6105656 many of the pennsylvania delegates worked their heart out for sen clinton and theyre excited to cast a vote for her from my vantage point that will be closure for them
6105657 the government has taken tremendous liberties with our liberty taking away our liberty in the name of fighting terrorism using fear to take away peoples rights and their privacy in this country
6105658 and thats caused me and a lot of americans to lose a great deal of faith in the government which ought to be protecting our liberties not taking them away
6105659 they simply dont want the competition from an outsider so to speak somebody that might make them feel uncomfortable by raising some issues some new perspectives some new choices for the american people
6105660 youll get to see hillary speak on tuesday and barack obama the next president of the united states on thursday
6105661 and i hear hillary and you will have a chat ill make sure to stop by
6105662 i think it was a mix between the food poisoning and nerves i am over it but i felt a little flat out there
6105663 the thought of going out in a heat is horrible i want to feel the plane ticket was worth the money and show i am worthy of being here
6105664 there will be a disciplinary commission hearing about her case on thursday morning and because she is a medallist it will be then passed to the executive board
6105665 lack of competition in school sports being a positive step

6105668 call last week for americans to break their addiction to oil
6105669 is it doesnt have any real distinct tonality to it its pleasant to listen to its an voice
6105670 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6105671 this election cycle they are asking me to sound less like an announcer and more like a real person
6105672 it often feels like there is sort of more colloquial language like when i say things like is this really his plan
6105673 the sort of straight authoritarian announcer sometimes is still appropriate but a lot of times it will be noise or wallpaper to people
6105674 and i invented the remote control too another round of this and ill sell my television
6105675 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
6105676 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
6105677 cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
6105678 senator mccain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge
6105679 in iraq gains have been made in lowering the level of violence thanks to the outstanding efforts of our military the increasing capability of iraqs security forces the cease fire of shiite militias and the decision taken by sunni tribes to take the fight to al qaeda
6105680 understand what the essential argument was about before the surge i argued that the long term solution in iraq is political the iraqi government must reconcile its differences and take responsibility for its future that holds true today
6105681 he is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
6105682 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure and he declared that behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has many times before that i put personal ambition before my country
6105683 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
6105684 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
6105685 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
6105686 instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
6105687 well ah ah i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective
6105688 answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
6105689 this is something that i have not i think come to a firm resolution on i think its very hard to know what that means when life begins is it when a cell separates is it when the soul stirs so i dont presume to know the answer to that question what i know as ive said before is that there is something extraordinarily powerful about potential life and that has a moral weight to it that we take into consideration when were having these debates
6105690 im not sure if there are human beings in there but go ahead and blow it up
6105691 of his race and questions about his patriotism values and faith that republicans have already vigorously sought to raise and exploit
6105692 im asking a lot of the american people and i know that
6105693 my biography is not typical of a modern american president
6105694 ive looked down the barrel of an m 16 at an enemy of our nation put him in my sights and squeezed the trigger you never have and anyone anyone who thinks ill do any less to our enemies today knows nothing about who i really am
6105695 how do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake
6105696 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
6105697 there are droughts in north and south carolina parts of california most of new zealand and this idiot who firmly believes he can induce rain by prayer is wasting it by asking his lord and savior to play a political prank its not boyish humor and youre a selfish hypocrite
6105698 the democratic vice presidential prick in 2000 who now is an independent
6105699 following the lead of political families like the strogers and lipinskis illinois senate president emil jones is anointing one of his children to take over for him when he retires in january
6105700 his preference yes would be to see his son serve
6105701 in rural minnesota one district is skipping classes every monday to save fuel nationwide at least 14 other districts are switching to four day weeks and dozens more are considering it

6105709 is an obscene continent fit only for second rate people second rate whites with second rate ambitions who are prepared as in south africa to indulge in the obscenity of disciplining africans you either stay away from the continent or you go there and discipline the savages

6105711 naipauls nasjonalisme er med andre ord en kj rlighet til en id til en tanke om hva india burde v re ikke til hva det er
6105712 indians defecate everywhere they defecate mostly beside the railway tracks but they also defecate on the beaches they defecate on the hills they defecate on the river banks they defecate on the streets they never look for cover
6105713 naipauls sense of the past is so intense so profound that he sees them
6105714 as rejectors of their indigenous belief engaged in a dreadful mangling of history
6105715 forskjellen mellom sivilisasjon og barbari er en forskjell mellom de kulturene som
6105716 he believed civilization to be something laboriously achieved which was only precariously defended he wanted to see the defences fully manned and he hated the liberals because he thought them gullible and feeble believing in the easy perfectibility of man and ready to abandon the work of centuries for sentimental qualms
6105717 the ease with which civilization can be destroyed when i was in africa and saw in the congo the ruins of belgian cities when i saw the same thing in rwanda in 1966 i knew about people camping in houses and not knowing what to do with the things just stripping it apart
6105718 the pursuit of happiness it is an elastic idea it fits all men it implies a certain kind of society a certain kind of awakened spirit so much is contained in it the idea of the individual responsibility choice the life of the intellect the idea of vocation and perfectibility and achievement it is an immense human idea it cannot be reduced to a fixed system it cannot generate fanaticism but it is known to exist and because of that other more rigid systems in the end blow away
6105719 democrats on the ground and their operators from the democratic national committee and the state organization and the gore campaign deliberately and systematically scrutinized for challenge every military absentee ballot and knocked out as many as they could on whatever technicality they could find or even invent
6105720 the iraqis who have risen up against the occupation are not insurgents or terrorists or the enemy they are the revolution the minutemen and their numbers will grow and they will win
6105721 osama bin laden and these non nation state fighters with religious purpose are very similar to those kinds of atypical revolutionaries that helped to cast off the british crown

6105723 obamas vice presidential choice will show a great deal about how he plans to run the rest of his race and how he will lead if elected
6105724 this choice is especially important since obama has this opportunity to fill a perceived weakness and experience gap with voters this worked well for george bush when he selected dick cheney
6105725 obama can make another type of choice to get elected by selecting a young vibrant running mate to emphasise change this worked for bill clinton with his selection of al gore
6105726 det r en fr jd att vara n ra leoparder

6105731 i was really annoyed its not good sportsmanship to pull on someones feet what is all that about
6105732 to get a medal is amazing we did not have a tactic we just went out and swam every part of my body was aching but i tried pushing for the gold
6105733 i look at the aspects of our ticket where were strongest and where were most in need of help and joe brings more to the ticket than any of the other people whose names are mentioned as finalists
6105734 with all due respect and i know the other folks in consideration theyre a wonderful group but theyre not really all that close
6105735 you guys have better things to do im not the guy
6105736 take an active role to help secure a lasting settlement of the israeli palestinian conflict
6105737 its not enough for the next president to commit again to trying
6105738 to muster the political will for an intensive effort that brings the parties together hammers out their differences and brings about an agreement
6105739 well no but you have to ask yourself what it means
6105740 president elect mccain will be making a very big mistake by appointing joe leiberman as his vp
6105741 you ever notice how anyone who stands between them and power is an evil idiot bent on the destruction of the world funny how that works
6105742 actually the far right often accuses chavez not only of wanting to take over south america but often insinuate that hes working with iran to install nukes the far right often accuses syria of attacking us interests granted considering israel is our 51st state thats not unexpected as for mugabe the far right has been rather silent i guess its more important to pretend that were all georgians than to take an actual stand on mugabes horrific abuses
6105743 in the olympics we recognize that its possible for two competitors to both be perfect 10s a judge who feels that way can give both athletes the top score americans dont have that option in the voting booth even if you like two candidates you can vote for only one this is the root of the spoiler effect whenever two candidates base of support overlaps like al gore and ralph nader in 2000 voters who like both have to choose one and sometimes that prevents the most popular candidate from winning its happened at least five times in u s presidential elections one possible reform is to use a rating system much like that used in the olympics some have criticized scoring systems as complicated but people use them online all the time now rating videos and books on youtube and amazon both computer simulations and some real world trials have made a strong case that rating systems do the best job of reflecting voter sentiment
6105744 no matter when such election reforms are more widely enacted theres no good reason why pollsters shouldnt conduct some polls giving people greater choices right now
6105745 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
6105746 if obamas able to win in these states it will have more to do with national trends against the republican party manifesting themselves than with political and demographic changes on the ground
6105747 that national shift has to be great enough to upset the historical pattern of these states tending to vote republican for president
6105748 this has been a difficult year for most of us in many different ways
6105749 the votes going to be tight theres no denying that
6105750 i really think there are enough people who i dont want to say fear barack obama but just dont know him and will end up voting for mccain
6105751 hes focused about the workers and what he wants for our future
6105752 we see him on the news but we dont pay much attention to him
6105753 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6105754 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6105755 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6105756 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6105757 half of dems nationwide agree that hillarys act of putting her name in nomination you know that heinous scheming act at the heart of hillarys plot to steal the convention for herself think it will help unify the party only 28 disagree
6105758 i believe her testimony could have changed the course of history now others believed that she would hurt anita hill

6105762 the challenge for west virginia the challenge for coal producing states and nations is that as historically produced coal is a dirty fuel and is regarded as a dirty fuel
6105763 and there are environmental issues associated with the production and consumption of coal
6105764 if you want to do energy well in an environmentally sound fashion go to west virginia go to appalachia
6105765 we all win in that equation thats our great opportunity
6105766 the physically reality is that we cannot bridge to the future for decades if not hundreds of years without coal as part of the equation
6105767 if you accept that premise then your choices are how do we do coal well how do we do coal clean how do we capture the opportunities for coal
6105768 carbon sequestration is going to double the cost of coal fired power
6105769 one of the coal presidents said it is at least 15 maybe 20 years away from being commercially viable
6105770 there are a myriad of legal issues that are unresolved whos going to take the liability if it comes back out of the ground and the energy it takes ive heard estimates it could take 15 or 20 of the power of the power plant makes to strip out the co 2 thats going to raise the cost of electricity
6105771 im not sure that we can really appease the individuals that want to see coal eliminated abolished from the energy mix of this country
6105772 but those individuals and groups that have concerns about the environment or the impacts of mining certainly we can be more responsive to those concerns
6105773 right now we dont have a comprehensive bill out there
6105774 we havent been allowed to vote on anything that i think is going to address high gasoline prices and dependence on foreign oil and any time we do get something its a fight to get anything related to coal in there
6105775 pay any price bear any burden in the defense of liberty
6105776 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
6105777 they told me there are going to be resources here
6105778 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
6105779 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
6105780 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
6105781 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
6105782 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
6105783 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
6105784 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
6105785 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
6105786 trying so hard to be perfect that it is stultifying
6105787 if obama gets elected and there is nothing funny about him it wont be the economy thats depressed it will be the rest of us
6105788 bidens son is a lawyer who would be nowhere near the front lines
6105789 for mccains son it was either the army or jail thats why mccain rarely mentions he son in iraq
6105790 i didnt decide to run for president to start a national crusade for the political reforms i believed in or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism in truth i wanted to be president because it had become my ambition to be president
6105791 why is chelsea clinton so ugly because her father is janet reno
6105792 instead of focusing on positive free market solutions to energy challenges speaker of the house nancy pelosi and the democratic majority are pushing for the proven failed tax and regulatory policies of the past
6105793 and they are cheered on by global warming alarmists like al gore who want energy to be much more expensive so americans use less
6105794 educate citizens on the hot air in the energy and global warming debates
6105795 the oil and gas industry has launched a frenzied attack on these balanced common sense protections
6105796 i am here today to urge the cogcc to do what is best for all of colorado and tell an industry that routinely uses and spills dozens of toxic chemicals to stay at least 300 feet away from public drinking water sources
6105797 with tens of thousands of more wells on the way we need strong protections to ensure the oil and gas industry does not jeopardize our health and safety
6105798 we know theres more rehab ahead but he is on schedule
6105799 the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance
6105800 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines
6105801 whats less apparent is the judgment to be commander in chief
6105802 and in matters of national security good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president as we were all reminded 10 days ago by events in the nation of georgia
6105803 they did it to massachusetts sen john kerry they did it to former vice president al gore they tried to do it to former president clinton they did it to former massachusetts gov michael dukakis
6105804 thats what they do thats their politics they dont know how to govern they know how to run a negative campaign
6105805 in order for us to win we not only have to beat the attack machine weve got to win back the trust of the american people
6105806 the same guys that brought you george bush are now trying to bring you john mccain theyve basically got the same strategy which is they cant win an argument on ideas so what theyre going to do is theyre going to try to attack me
6105807 this may not be directly affiliated with the campaign but you know suddenly magically you got the same guy who wrote unfit for command
6105808 he comes out with a new book saying that im a nut
6105809 in the term of the next president skillful handling of such a crisis could be the difference between temporary hardship and far reaching disaster
6105810 unless you are in the top one tenth of 1 in this country you are not better off than you were four years ago or eight years ago
6105811 its because of that experience that when i hear that women are being treated unfairly in the workplace where theres injustice and were not seeing the basic principle of equal pay for equal work i get mad and i get frustrated
6105812 la nostra una societ nuova ci dice il direttore sportivo enzo tarantino ed anche la squadra stata praticamente ricostruita quasi da zero e giusto quindi che il nostro obiettivo base sia una tranquilla salvezza se poi strada facendo ci accorgeremo di poter raggiungere traguardi pi interessanti sar certamente tutto di guadagnato
6105813 il lavoro sinora svolto abbiamo iniziato la preparazione il 28 luglio stato pi che soddisfacente
6105814 la societ seria ed ottimamente organizzata e mi ha messo a disposizione un gruppo di ragazzi con cui sto lavorando alla perfezione a far da traino alla squadra prosegue mister aprile saranno certamente i ragazzi reduci dalla bella salvezza conquistata con la maglia dello sporting palermo tutti atleti validi di cui mi fido totalmente
6105815 we are in ohio in a significant way with a full operational staff with offices all across the state
6105816 weve been running television ads now for i believe seven weeks we view ohio as a very important part of our puzzle to get enough electoral votes to win the presidency for barack
6105817 there is no question that ohios electoral votes are critical to that victory
6105818 its always a major battleground state its really no different this year
6105819 ive been engaged in a lot of presidential campaigns during my life i have never seen a presidential campaign in ohio come anywhere close to where this campaign is organizationally and in terms of having actual man and woman power in the field
6105820 but she made it very clear shes really not counting on it and she was urging all of her supporters to get beyond the speculation
6105821 it would be such a shocker at this point because so many people have written it off
6105822 im not saying its what he would do but if he has quietly kept her in the mix it would have a powerful effect to kind of come out of the blue
6105823 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
6105824 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
6105825 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
6105826 a lot of companies are unaware of where their catalogue paper comes from
6105827 we want to work with them and pressure them to do the right thing by adopting sustainable policies
6105828 at first they werent responsive but then they saw how it would benefit them
6105829 consumer opinion has a lot of power to influence companies
6105830 we continue to work within the supply chain to promote certification of forests and fibre and we are engaged with our suppliers to continuously improve on our prudent use of natural resources
6105831 sears has yet to make any policy changes so well continue to lobby them
6105832 we confront more than the usual number of people who dont respond or cant respond people are away from their homes heading back from summer vacation or preparing their children for the start of the school year
6105833 how could they accuse of me of doing something wrong
6105834 if im not re elected our state will lose its influence
6105835 energy questions in the united states flow from the very fact that we have an energy policy in the first place
6105836 either the swimmers got it or they dont the suit will not win the race
6105837 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
6105838 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
6105839 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
6105840 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
6105841 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
6105842 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
6105843 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
6105844 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
6105845 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
6105846 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
6105847 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
6105848 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
6105849 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
6105850 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
6105851 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
6105852 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
6105853 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
6105854 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
6105855 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
6105856 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
6105857 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
6105858 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
6105859 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
6105860 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
6105861 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
6105862 oh my gosh the ice caps are melting and were all gonna die before lunch
6105863 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative
6105864 which is as textbook a case of the pot calling the kettle black as has ever been recorded
6105865 gore is the person who in the congress most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an internet
6105866 has played a powerful role in policy terms that has supported its continued growth and application for which we should be thankful
6105867 in a way you have a better chance of weeding them out if you meet them online you can go through quite a few email and phone exchanges before you actually meet and if you ask enough of the tough questions before you meet you can learn quite a bit about people
6105868 when i met my current beau id actually pretty much given up on meeting anyone of substance at least i was taking a break after meeting a number of nice guys that i knew would never amount to a relationship so i hid my profile and started haunting the forums on pof answering questions on everything from dating to fitness i noticed my current beau who was a regular poster there a beautiful writer who contributed to poetry forums and had long exchanges on many other topics from politics to relationships
6105869 i was email friends with tim whom i met in the chat room for at least a year and a half he was one of a group that i planned to meet when i visited washington state i do want to stress that the friendship was totally platonic and had never gone beyond that stage i was not looking for someone and neither was he
6105870 there were probably a dozen normal guys for every one weirdo i think the important thing to keep in mind is that the men who use dating services are pretty much doing it for the same reason that women are to find someone they connect with
6105871 the sites are getting more on top of the freaks
6105872 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
6105873 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
6105874 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
6105875 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
6105876 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
6105877 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
6105878 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
6105879 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
6105880 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
6105881 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
6105882 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
6105883 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
6105884 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
6105885 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
6105886 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
6105887 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
6105888 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
6105889 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
6105890 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
6105891 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
6105892 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
6105893 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
6105894 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
6105895 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
6105896 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
6105897 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
6105898 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
6105899 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
6105900 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
6105901 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
6105902 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
6105903 this is being done in a friendly and straightforward way
6105904 it is also all about what we can do to reduce our carbon footprint and greenhouse gases
6105905 these are all small things and they all add up
6105906 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
6105907 i know theres no one who knows the subject matter that hes going to have to deal with better than john
6105908 his attitude toward the environment at pennfuture has been very angry
6105909 i think id characterize some of his views as extreme
6105910 theres no one i trust more than mary jo white in striking a balance
6105911 helped shape bills that were both tremendously positive for pennsylvania businesses and at the same time good for our environment
6105912 he starts off with some positives and starts off with a few negatives but i think he can work his way toward confirmation
6105913 i know exactly the difference between being an advocate in the private sector and having a public responsibility
6105914 whats important is working hard listening to everyone considering different views and trying to arrive at fair productive answers
6105915 view of economic development is through regulation litigation and taxation theyve supported so many taxes against our members i think the appointment is a concern for us
6105916 were certainly hopeful that the secretary designate despite the constituency he most recently represented will be able to shift gears and represent a broader constituency that includes us
6105917 all of these things are just incredibly expensive to the public while yielding almost no environmental benefit
6105918 if you cant compete with petroleum at 120 a barrel you cant compete
6105919 the whole concept of state government playing around in venture capital is nonsense
6105920 i think hes done an excellent job leading pennfuture and i think hell transfer all that experience and passion to his new position
6105921 it is always good guruslash posted 25 hours ago from
6105922 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
6105923 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
6105924 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
6105925 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
6105926 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
6105927 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
6105928 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
6105929 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
6105930 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
6105931 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
6105932 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
6105933 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
6105934 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
6105935 i still dont understand how mcgovern could have lost i dont know a single person who voted for nixon
6105936 how is obama going to lose when he will get so much more votes in november than john mcbush
6105937 if anwr is so small and so filled with oil why not slant drill into it do you really think that the only oil in alaska is directly under anwr seriously
6105938 you do know that the oil companies are only drilling on a fraction of the land they currently have leases for why is that maybe because there are no more rigs to send out no more ships to transport and no more capacity at the refineries we have today have you thought of that phil
6105939 i guess since you are so well versed on oil recovery why do they lease so many acres and only find it on a miniscule percentage they have 68 million acres that have no oil on it
6105940 why do they lease so many acres and only find it on a miniscule percentage
6105941 iraq and afghanistan were supposed to instill fear in the mighty american war machine and make the terrorists think twice about attacking us instead the bush mccain war plan has made us the laughing stock of the planet and emboldened the enemy we have zero credibility we now are the torturers we are the ones with secret ussr like prisons we are the ones who refuse fair trials we are the ones who spy on our own citizens this is what obama brings to the table if its change from bush mccain failed policies thats all we need
6105942 oil drilling in anwr would not impact the u s oil supply for at least a decade
6105943 the opening of anwr would reduce the price of imported low sulfur light crude oil by only 0 75 per barrel in 2025
6105944 oh yeah there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq
6105945 im saving the word pelosi realization that democratic seats would be lost if she didnt bring off shore drilling up to a vote
6105946 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
6105947 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
6105948 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
6105949 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war

6105957 the terrorists should know that the only way for them is to give themselves up
6105958 as the president of the republic has said many times the state will unflinchingly fight terrorism with a strong determination until its total elimination in our country
6105959 at the same time algeria will not deviate from the path of national reconciliation chosen by the nation and which has already given major progress in the consolidation of security across the national territory
6105960 the chinese government condemns this terrorist action and we express deep condolences to the deceased
6105961 we firmly oppose terrorism in all forms and we support the algerian governments efforts in combating terrorism and safeguarding national stability

6105965 st is expected to exercise its option to buy nxps 20 percent of st nxp wireless before the closing of this transaction
6105966 the mobile phone industry is very much controlled by nokia ericsson has to do something to compete
6105967 ericsson is becoming more and more a pure network company the first step was the spinning off of the sony ericsson mobile phone part and now they are doing the same thing with the mobile phone platform part
6105968 in a business where scale matters the complementary product portfolios contributed by the parent companies will deliver significant scale and synergies by leveraging and expanding the existing strategic cooperation
6105969 this generation of prosperity had put millions of americans in new homes and millions of new cars on our roads
6105970 president richard nixon also called for greater efficiency standards at the federal level and for exploration of energy using the best options they had at the time extracting oil from shale and tar sands and developing cleaner coal technology
6105971 but when the same demagogues in the middle east who created the supply shortage decided to increase supply once again all the initiatives to use less and produce more energy were abandoned now 36 years later we again face a crisis an oil crisis a carbon crisis and a conservation crisis
6105972 the vehicles we drive have gotten bigger heavier and less efficient our homes have gotten larger and require ever more power to heat and cool our lives have become filled with new technologies that have changed the world for the better but increased the thirst for greater quantities of energy
6105973 this emergency far more complex than the one we faced three and a half decades ago harms our economy threatens our national security and pollutes to our environment
6105974 we are here today to accept the challenge of creating a clean energy revolution
6105975 the imperative is to end the drain of the american treasury both public and private which flow to the hands of volatile governments who control the worlds oil supply ultimately our vision is to bequeath to our children and our childrens children the livable planet that they deserve
6105976 if past is prologue and it is we know that this clean energy revolution will be complicated
6105977 so here in las vegas on august 19 2008 we are gathered gathered to share what we know where we are and what we do next
6105978 today in nevada there are 57 operating renewable energy projects producing 400 megawatts of electricity
6105979 our host the university of nevada las vegas is known for its high energy basketball and in the future it will be known as the leader in clean energy
6105980 look to nearby nellis air force base and you will find the worlds largest photovoltaic plant which provides more than 25 percent of the bases power
6105981 the first geothermal plant in america was built in nevada in 1984
6105982 unfortunately further work this year has been blocked by those creating a distraction by insisting that we talk about nothing but coastal drilling
6105983 even then it will be a drop in the global bucket
6105984 when people in the future look upon the polluted world of 2008 they will see a partnership of two politically differing individuals who came together to show responsible leadership
6105985 oil will be one part of our energy puzzle for years to come as we develop and produce the technologies that will one day render it unnecessary
6105986 congress should pass a long term extension of tax incentives for private sector entrepreneurs who are standing by ready to invest billions of dollars in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects
6105987 all of this will happen if we grasp the enormous economic opportunity this shift to renewables will create
6105988 for example if just 20 percent of our nations power came from renewables by 2020 we would create hundreds of thousands of direct jobs and save consumers many billions of dollars in lower bills
6105989 if we choose to embrace this challenge we can fundamentally change our world which will benefit every creature and person that inhabits it
6105990 we are taking the results and recommendations of this energy summit to the democratic and republican national conventions
6105991 and when we meet again next year i have every expectation that we will do so with a president a congress and a nation finally ready to fully embrace the great energy opportunities that lie ahead
6105992 while we still see that financial performance may weaken because of the more challenging market conditions they have a very strong loss absorption capacity if you were to look at their capital position they are very healthy and among the region they are one of the highest rated credit profiles
6105993 most of the expansion we saw in the loan growth came from the construction sector and if the construction industry were to experience some slowdown then the banks would experience some difficulty in cash flows getting money from the property players and this will of course give rise to deterioration in their loan books
6105994 even if the united states escapes the technical definition of a recession which may well be the case it will certainly go into a period of prolonged economic slowdown very mediocre growth and certainly experience a great deal of financial stresses this may cause investors and businesses to withdraw and create extremely difficult conditions for businesses including banks

6105998 this situation compels the dprk north korea to heighten vigilance against such unjust demands as the verification in line with the international standard recently claimed by the us as regards the nuclear issue
6105999 the dprk will increase its war deterrent in every way as long as the us and its followers continue posing military threats to it
6106000 it will take more time to resolve the issue but there is no fixed deadline
6106001 the acquisition of london mining brasil along with our investment in mpp ensures that our iron ore base is further diversified in the face of tighter supply for raw materials
6106002 the tone of the august discussion confirms that the interest rate debate remains finely balanced for now
6106003 accordingly there is little here to suggest that other members are about to join blanchflower in voting for a cut in the very near future
6106004 nonetheless with inflation close to a peak and the economy heading towards recession we still think rates could be falling by year end and will eventually drop much further than the markets expect
6106005 most members of the committee judged that the current stance of monetary policy was broadly appropriate and that bank rate should be maintained at five percent this month
6106006 inflation was likely to move further above the governments 2 0 percent target in the coming months the outlook for activity growth had continued to worsen but some build up in the margin of spare capacity was likely to be necessary to ensure that inflation returned to the target in the medium term
6106007 i really do feel passionately about promoting cycling its a great sport and an increase in profile can benefit not just myself but my sport
6106008 thanks to the successes of mark cavendish on the tour de france this year as well cycling on the whole is receiving such a boost now
6106009 hopefully we can get more people into it and it will benefit
6106010 weve got so many young riders coming through that cycling could end up becoming not a major sport but one that people know about and have opinions about
6106011 people might feel a bit of inspiration to get their bike out the garage oil the chain and use it for riding to work it doesnt have to be about elite performance it can be about riding your bike for fun
6106012 i dont spend enough time up there and i love going back specially when the festival is on its just a magical time to be there i think ill catch the last couple of days
6106013 theyre the things you miss when youre competing all the time
6106014 you always have self doubt thats what drives athletes on
6106015 youre always questioning yourself can i do this if you know you can do something its not a challenge and its boring
6106016 you can never rest on your laurels there are always people snapping at your heels even in your own team
6106017 people like jason kenny and the others are going to keep me on my toes for the next few years
6106018 he was only 16 when i won gold in athens nobody could have imagined hed win gold and silver four years later
6106019 ive been hearing stories about kids or 15 16 year old riders setting amazing times recently at junior championships at newport velodrome
6106020 theres this depth of talent thats coming through that nobody even knows about they could be the riders in 2012
6106021 i think i was too tired to really go for it youre physically and mentally exhausted glad to be out of the track and away from the pressure
6106022 ill be saving that for a couple of nights until ive really recovered
6106023 i havent really realised how busy its going to be
6106024 i was still thinking its going to be like after athens and whether it finally will be i dont know
6106025 but in any case there are a lot of people wanting to get in touch with me
6106026 its not just me whos won the medals its these people in the background too
6106027 ive been very fortunate with the british team to have a family whove supported me through all the years to have a girlfriend who can put up with me being away from home for so long all these things make a difference
6106028 but one thing i do forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead i press on toward the goal to win the prize for which god has called me heavenward in christ jesus
6106029 but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord

6106081 now nobody gets too excited about it knocking off a macs milk store thats more common today than it was years ago
6106082 people do move here to get away from the city because they feel when theyre in the city youve got more violence more crimes and more of a chance of getting hurt
6106083 times have changed and were trying to keep up with them
6106084 it challenges the myth that cities are violent and rural areas are not
6106085 in huron county they were totally outraged because the people were such fine upstanding citizens they didnt deserve a death like that
6106086 people feel like theyve really been intruded upon because its not the way of life up here
6106087 its really a country feeling we have people come here because they want out of the rat race and a slower pace
6106088 its almost like an arms war at one point in time a good old fashioned fist fight may have been the way differences were sorted out
6106089 the increase in violence goes hand in hand with the need to arm oneself to have the advantage if you want to have the upper hand you go with the biggest gun guns are in the hands of young people and thats because they are actively seeking them
6106090 all kinds of crime is going on but it only becomes officially crime when police charge someone
6106091 it does depend upon the focus of police with weapons charges it might relate to a concentrated focus of police activity
6106092 instead what were seeing is a steady trend line up
6106093 what weve done is moved the crime up along various highways out of the gta and weve moved it into some of these communities where theyve never heard of anybody being arrested with a gun now its routine its had a devastating impact
6106094 i live here on less than a dollar a month
6106095 i live like a recluse no one knows i exist
6106096 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
6106097 it was very brief we spoke for just a few minutes it was like meeting a complete stranger
6106098 huruma is a tough place last january during the elections there was rioting and six people were hacked to death the police dont even arrest you they just shoot you
6106099 how do you make objective decisions on the best companies when the first decision is whether they can pay or not
6106100 sometimes the hottest start ups either cant afford it or dont need it
6106101 the idea that apple can choose what functionality my applications should have frightens me
6106102 how about legislation that requires a mandatory kill switch be integrated into every human being so that the police can kill an individual without even needing to dispatch an officer to a scene
6106103 were still in the wooden biplane era of cyber war it will get more sophisticated probably quite quickly the us has already created units for cyber defense so too has china no doubt russia and probably many others
6106104 if there had been a world wide web in the days of the blitz then the germans would have been attacking us on the net as well as from the air and wed have been doing the same back to them
6106105 one explanation might be that theres a group of consumers thats holding off making do with the devices that they have either because of larger economic concerns
6106106 all features you would expect in a high end digital camera but at a price point consumers can afford
6106107 the lonely planet guides will help travelers to find great places to eat shop and sleep as well as describing the popular sights and nightlife for each destination
6106108 templar arizona is such a strange comic it would not exist if hadnt existed in web comics form because nobody would take a chance on it i could try a publisher but im at stage where i dont really need one if i had one it would be to simplify my life it would have to be a publisher that would do all the advertising for me all the small press publishers expect the creator to do their share of the footwork and i already do that
6106109 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6106110 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6106111 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6106112 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6106113 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6106114 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6106115 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6106116 wang xiuying is almost blind and disabled what sort of re education through labour can she serve
6106117 but they can also be taken away at any time
6106118 we have no records of these two names in our system
6106119 this is part of the arsenal of repressive tactics that the government has used to silence dissent
6106120 china is riding roughshod over its promises to allow lawful protests during the games
6106121 show that while china has now proven it is able to host international events to perfection it still has a long way to go before it respects even minimal international human rights standards
6106122 the goal is to silence and deter them this goal has been achieved
6106123 in china like in other countries to apply for a demonstration you have to obey the law
6106124 the day we worked so hard for has finally arrived
6106125 its a critical time for the vaquita and the mexican government has stepped up to the plate
6106126 former prime minister chretien strongly criticizes current prime minister harper for not attending olympics will pay heavy price
6106127 with hebron we are launching a new era of energy projects in which we the people of newfoundland and labrador are stepping forward and proudly taking our place as full partners and active participants in energy resource development
6106128 never before in the history of our energy industry have we taken the bold steps that we are taking today never before in our history as a province have we been prepared to take these important steps toward self reliance
6106129 now mr paul gadd said he is ready to leave thailand
6106130 officials concerned are working through the process of putting him on the plane to take him out of the country but if he continues to refuse to leave then he will be confined in the airport transit area temporarily before being taken into a detention centre
6106131 no thats not true i love my crafty creative self but i dont like it when i have no self control
6106132 our goal is to a snapshot of the variety of events from inside and surrounding the convention everything from rock the vote concert and the american presidential experience to caucus meetings and interviews from the convention floor
6106133 kbdi has had the dnc covered for weeks with coverage on our public affairs programs
6106134 mayor john hickenlooper and former mayor wellington webb have been guests on the aaron harber show dnc specials and the dnc has been a frequent topic of colorado inside out
6106135 aurora has experienced significant growth in recent years growing too in the number of families in need of health care for their children
6106136 while health insurance coverage is one of the strongest predictors of whether children have access to health care even insured children arent guaranteed access to affordable appropriate high quality care the new clinic will provide students enrolled at crawford elementary and nine nearby schools the opportunity to more easily access and afford medical dental and mental health services
6106137 we know that children who lack access to quality health care are far more likely to miss school are less ready to learn and are more likely to go to the emergency room for treatable conditions such as asthma attacks or ear infections
6106138 its heartening to know that the rocky mountain youth clinics are providing a familiar accessible way for families to make sure that their children receive immunizations have access to primary and preventive health care and improved referrals to specialized care for complicated illnesses in turn these children are likely to have better school attendance and academic performance levels
6106139 as the consumer appetite for wireless connectivity increases the industry is requiring reliable standardized interface solutions that can transmit data at speeds equivalent to wired usb connections
6106140 by providing these performance levels our new pd720171 host controller is helping bring the industry closer to mainstream adoption of advanced wireless technologies

6106142 they tried so hard to bury me but i survived it every time
6106143 lets make this guy really interesting in the way that hannibal or joker is interesting
6106144 you look like youd fit in the trunk of my car
6106145 neither the art nor the words claim to be fair and balanced just factual and correct
6106146 if derek and i did something wrong we were not provided with an understandable explanation of what we did to jeopardize our page and we were certainly not warned to stop doing something before the books profile was deleted
6106147 every time we posted something favorable about barack obama we got spam complaints levied against us
6106148 interestingly chapter 10 is about rock and roll and censorship
6106149 and derek and i clearly argue the point that censorship does not work in capitalistic nations that have a free press
6106150 people are going to trust you before they trust those people on tv
6106151 you cant make peace with others unless others see that youre someone with moral authority
6106152 we need a president to make us proud again all over the world having the high ground makes a difference
6106153 but its in the judges hands all he could do is do what he did he performed real good i didnt think the guy beat him i think raynelle outpointed the guy and he should have got the decision hes a disciplined kid he trains hard every time hes in the gym hes an excellent kid a pleasure to work with
6106154 the purchase price was contingent on an appraisal that assumed the toxic chemical spill had been properly cleaned up an independent study conducted for forest city in 1999 had revealed the existence of pcbs in the soil but the appraisal company was not furnished with a copy of that report
6106155 a review of property assessments conducted at the request of the board of county commissioners reveals the extent of the environmental damage that still existed when the land was purchased from forest city soil samples showed high concentrations of chemicals that could harm workers hired to clean up the site including benzene toluene lead and thallium nickel and arsenic were discovered in groundwater samples
6106156 i think youre going to find stories in the free times that youll never find in the plain dealer
6106157 he made the music because it was inside of him and needed to be expressed
6106158 like a shark has to swim to breathe raven has to record his gut wrenching creations perhaps exorcising his demons onto wax one could say
6106159 i was in florida working for this guy who would fly his learjet to columbia and bring me the kilos to cut up with my musketry
6106160 i walked into his place and there was nothing in the house but brown paper bags full of pot there must have been one living room one kitchen three bedrooms full of dope
6106161 we were all toasted and i do mean all of us
6106162 the year was 1975 and there wasnt a drug on this planet i didnt have in my body that can tell you where i was
6106163 a lot of what governed me to that point was fear i was afraid that nothing was good enough it was just a bunch of bullshit really trappings of a scared kid who was afraid to sit down and do work with that change and the collapse of the record business and the fact that im getting older and realizing im an adult now those became motivators to enjoy the moment im now grateful to be able to do what im able to do and not just bitching about it i want to take advantage of the cards that have been dealt
6106164 i was ready for a change of scene we were born in cleveland and rehearsed in the phantasy and played with a handful of other original bands that came from that scene our approach to get signed was unique it wasnt just play out and hope that someone sees you it was really a strategic plan of working on music first and trying to get it in the hands of the right people when we did get signed and got attention i thought the interest and light on cleveland might be something like theres cool shit happening there but i came back from a year of touring and everybody hated us there was bitterness and this feeling of you didnt deserve that i was like see you later in hindsight there are things i miss i think fondly back on the time i spent cleaning toilets there certainly
6106165 what i was trying to do was create a safe haven
6106166 nine inch nails had been fortunate we had made music that had integrity and yet found a broad audience that had made labels money when they left me alone to do my own thing i was hoping that the idea was that nothing would be a barrier between the label and the artists it did work in the case of marilyn manson initially everyone was afraid of what he was i believed in it then when they saw it could work they did too
6106167 the other stuff nobody at interscope who was really putting it out gave a shit about
6106168 and we didnt have the resources to fight the fight that the bands we licensed needed i realized that running a record label is not what i do the idea and ambition was noble but the execution was ultimately flawed and ultimately futile
6106169 well i dont know if that will be the business model of everything in the future
6106170 we had just released ghosts a couple of months earlier and just put tickets for the summer sale on tour i really didnt want to make it seem like im hijacking people for every scrap of cash they have thats the thing im looking at nine inch nails as a whole entity thats not something you could do when you were on a major label when we were on a label your record business is one thing your touring business is one thing and your merch business is another now its just all one pot really
6106171 i really really felt like making music and being creative i wanted to do something immediate rather than looking at something like a year long project that was like ghosts i wanted to do something different i called up producer alan moulder who was free and just said come over here and whatever we do whatever we finish lets release if its any good i thought it might be nice to have a single or something before i knew it i had an ep and then there was a whole album done its scary because im used to having the luxury to go back and edit and think about things it felt good to me it felt like things were flowing i wanted to try it this way looking back there are things that i would do differently but im proud of it i dont know if thats how the next thing will be
6106172 i know it was kind of a sore spot a little while ago
6106173 to be honest its never been as much of a sore spot as the media has made it out to be we knew going into this that it would be different and for a while we tried to fight it weve realized the best thing to do is just let people say what they want because its not going to change who we are as a band
6106174 i actually think thats for the best because its a fan favorite and a lot of times those songs are better off saved just for the fans
6106175 there are a few different scenes going on in nashville
6106176 theres a great indie scene an awesome hardcore and punk scene and of course theres a lot of country music going on theres a little of everything i think we are lucky to have a place like that to call home
6106177 i never try to write on a subject i dont know anything about
6106178 needless to say we arent playing any new songs live we cant wait to get home and focus on writing were ready to put out a new record
6106179 you look at the typical rock band playing on late night tv playing their new hit single they have horrendously bad guitar players
6106180 i went through that phase where i just wanted to overplay the guitar but now i want to write about everything ive learned over the years
6106181 this album is a modern version of who i am as a well rounded artist a singer songwriter a guitar player and a producer
6106182 im not going to go out and sing africa or rosanna
6106183 it wouldnt be fair to the band to me thats shitting on a legacy and i have a little bit of pride left for what we all did
6106184 im gonna buy my love an suv im gonna sink it in the deep black sea
6106185 everything they do is to keep us in our place
6106186 we went out to the west coast last summer and it was great but it just seemed too far especially with gas prices we hadnt really been to new england at all and we wanted to go especially since its so close we want to tour as much as possible ideally once the album comes out we might be able to get on tour with a bigger band
6106187 we recorded the first self titled album in craigs basement and ended up with 13 songs we thought it seemed like a pretty good album the album came out in april of 2006 and a friend asked us to play a show that was in june of 2006 so we got a band together here we are a few years later its amazing but its great its so exciting im still not used to it
6106188 the perfect album for riding in the car with the windows down on a summer day
6106189 i think as we were writing it i had an easier time picturing what the final result would sound like with the first album we hadnt done it before and id come up with acoustic guitar and vocal parts and didnt know what we would end up with this time it was easier to picture that and that helped me keep more focused i think craig had that experience too
6106190 from the places they live to the cars they drive
6106191 its not dedicated to the club scene its got a hip hop flavor to it we had to bring that back to the scene its like an album its more subtle and smooth
6106192 how does it feel to be snubbed by the rock hall
6106193 its great to talk to a rock hall member our city embraces you
6106194 hello cleveland anyone who has ever enjoyed spinal tap would never get tired of saying that
6106195 he looked like someone had just thrown him through a glass window
6106196 a couple thousand dollars a month its a cost that brings nothing to the business but people expect security when they go someplace
6106197 and bayne and rufus wouldnt pay 25 on fridays and saturdays people are quick to point the finger but theres nobody to help
6106198 all were saying to husarick is step up and partner with people and take responsibility
6106199 the gay and lesbian community has come a long way we dont have to go to the worst areas in the worst neighborhoods its time for business owners to step up to the plate
6106200 it is with huge regret and disappointment that we have been forced to cancel our imminent european festival appearances at
6106201 we know you will be hugely disappointed and so are we canceling shows is never an easy decision and we apologize to all our fans friends and family for not being there to throw down with you we will be back in europe this november and cant wait to see you all then
6106202 they both have their own particular brand of idiocy thankfully im not like either of them
6106203 i love the broad comedy the drummer falling over the sweating the nakedness
6106204 by the end i really loved fish and i really wanted him to succeed its a coming of age story for a 40 year old former heavy metal drummer which is a different breed of drummer
6106205 a heavy metal drummer is a showman its about pumping up the nosebleed seats in the arena and the double kick drum and the stick tricks and finding the hot girls in the audience and making sweat sexy again drummers are notoriously idiots but theres a special kind of idiocy to the showman drummer
6106206 i was in one of the worst cover bands ever called collected moss
6106207 metal was inescapable if you were anywhere near a radio in the mid 80s
6106208 so i certainly knew all the metal hits but those metal guys dressed like the ladies they started to dress like my aunt mary lou how are people taking this seriously
6106209 thankfully i had gone over to the punk and new wave side of things circa 1982 or so i started with the clash and went to elvis costello and the english beat and xtc and r e m so i got to skip the hair metal and it was awesome
6106210 its about fish but its really an ensemble movie its not one of those movies where jim carrey is the funny guy and everyone else is a straight person around him
6106211 drink too much of anything and youre bound to do some crazy stuff
6106212 we just didnt get enough traffic for it to be successful
6106213 maybe people wanted hard liquor or maybe four hours wasnt enough time for people to settle in
6106214 we are using the restaurant as a venue for our in house catering
6106215 the theater brings art and culture to our city and encourages shopping and dining downtown
6106216 we are thankful to mrs mcgrainor who has helped preserve this important resource in our community
6106217 and thats the way it is this fill in the month day and year
6106218 im ted fucking williams and im the greatest hitter in baseball
6106219 i grew up wanting to change my name to moose
6106220 ms obrien were sorry to inform you that you only have about six months until you go to disney
6106221 some of these guys never miss and every shot is strategized
6106222 the difference between the teams that win and everybody else is that every player on a winning team can make any shot some guys are just great point shooters or some guys are only masters at bank shots but the great players make every shot look easy
6106223 its one of those provincial cities where a lot of people stay their whole lives
6106224 its half collinwood half murray hill where bocce is a social gathering and guys smoke cigars catch up and get away from everything
6106225 i sorta felt the story coming together there and it made sense to me
6106226 my mother said why did you write a book about crime and drugs
6106227 his boss was a vice president and he said oh
6106228 i got into it thinking it would be temporary but it turned into a career the discipline transferred well to fiction
6106229 i was playing jazz fusion and big band music well before journey
6106230 people knew me from that band but journey was the odd situation i liked my rock music but ive always considered myself a jazz drummer
6106231 even though the camp was a great success it didnt have a great music facility to make it more of a success we found a good facility in cleveland to go to classes have some food and hang out afterward to play and listen to music
6106232 i dont think itll be as harsh as american idol but itll be in the spirit of what we can do to make you a better musician
6106233 that is fantastic feedback into helping you clarify who you are as a musician
6106234 its one big happy family its like tailgating with a mardi gras atmosphere
6106235 i was thinking about me with five girls in these pimped out short shorts
6106236 with the girls i play with we could probably win
6106237 there are people who bring out deep fryers and have this big spread of food and huge tents to make it an all day party
6106238 im just a people person its all about fun man and keeping the sport going
6106239 they said if its got a drinking game we want you to be a part of it
6106240 ive never actually counted how many f words there are
6106241 but if youre going to play with shots i guarantee youre not walking out of the bar
6106242 fans will be put on camera if they have one
6106243 the success of our promotions pretty much made this happen
6106244 pure brainstorming is responsible for this original night it should put grins on fans faces
6106245 i want to be ready because i dont want to make an abrupt transition
6106246 i put the seat down to practice i put 100 bottles of shampoo in the tub so that im used to it i take myself to movies i dont want to see i dont even know who she is but were fighting
6106247 i dont have add my mind is just filled with a lot of crap
6106248 because when too many tibetans gather in one place they are afraid well rise up
6106249 i always thought it was str int wis dex cha con i think that goes pretty old school though as f
6106250 so if the sin here is that the protest is ineffective what would an effective protest be
6106251 20 manny we made the squares and sent them in and she seamed them together and then put a backing
6106252 i saw this at the comic con and its presented like the top strip from a newspaper that it was a
6106253 takuan if the idiot provocateur 13 were a sympathizer of the chinese government s he probably wou
6106254 mr mccain i wish to inform you that we have informed much higher power about your ranting they ar
6106255 dont newspapers etc have fact checkers that after the story is mostly written call back sour
6106256 regardless of my opinion on if tibet should be freed or not does anyone actually believe china will
6106257 this is a known iphone bug that is being fixed in the next software update in september

6106260 watch black in america and join my group to get pissed
6106261 i think all of america will get a good glimpse of what its like to be black in this country
6106262 well do things our own way and dont butt in
6106263 america is being overrun by an invasion force from mexico
6106264 hey guys remember this is america it s not what you know but who you know right
6106265 ringtones have become such personal statements that a specially created condom ringtone seemed just the right way of combining a practical message with a fun approach
6106266 our analysis shows that were not treating the obesity epidemic with the urgency it deserves
6106267 even though communities have started taking action considering the scope of the problem the countrys response has been severely limited for significant change to happen combating obesity must become a national priority
6106268 gott ist todt an seinem mitleiden mit den menschen ist er gestorben
6106269 the mousse like texture glides on like the finest silk leaving a sumptuous matte finish behind as it absorbs any oils on the skins surface
6106270 they should be sexy and slinky not big baggy weekend jeans
6106271 we like a very messy thin roll rolled twice so you see a little above the ankle
6106272 if the government is going to decriminalise the process we need to do it with our eyes wide open and demand modern legislation that spells out a standard of care for our women
6106273 i am determined to get support from all mps to pass amendments whatever the outcome of the conscience vote
6106274 the government is trying to radically reform abortion laws to make it far easier for women to have abortions with no legal consideration of the human cost
6106275 the bill represents an enormous step forward in safeguarding womens rights to appropriate timely and safe clinical care
6106276 once legislation to decriminalise abortion is passed the rights and safety of women mothers sisters daughters will at long last be protected
6106277 slow down take a deep breath whats the hurry why wear yourself out just what are you after anyway
6106278 what was that all about and who are you just what the hell are you doing thats a new car and that brick you threw is going to cost a lot of money why did you do it
6106279 please mister please im sorry but i didnt know what else to do
6106280 i threw the brick because no one else would stop
6106281 he rolled off the curb and fell out of his wheelchair and i cant lift him up
6106282 would you please help me get him back into his wheelchair hes hurt and hes too heavy for me
6106283 dont go through life so fast that someone has to throw a brick at you to get your attention
6106284 sei du selbst die ver nderung die du dir w nschst f r diese welt
6106285 quite honestly its a tough market but the business did run well
6106286 its getting more difficult for us to grow our share as the decline becomes more prolonged
6106287 best olympic game of softball that has ever been played
6106288 if that doesnt get us back into the olympics then i dont know what will
6106289 i dont think i would have to say anything to him
6106290 watching that game it showed softball is a great sport
6106291 for it not to be included at london is very disappointing but as you can see today it is a great sport with great athletes
6106292 i have no doubt that it was the best olympic game of softball that has ever been played
6106293 it was one of the most intense games that i have ever pitched
6106294 that was my last shot its disappointing but we had our opportunities
6106295 including time spent on commuting and work related activities outside the workplace you work an average of 79 15 hours per week for that you were paid a net 10 85 per hour after expenses such as gasoline child care clothing for work and the like
6106296 in an average week you have about 16 19 hours of leisure time each of those hours is purchased in effect with 4 89 hours of work time or 53 03
6106297 the ultimate aim of any taxation measure in relation to transport needs to be to reduce emissions
6106298 the greens will move to have the luxury car tax transformed into a tax based on vehicle greenhouse emissions and we are keen to discuss how best to achieve this with the government opposition and independents
6106299 before the discussions are finalised it is too soon to say how the greens may finally vote
6106300 if thats their attitude i guess it just shows they dont care about people in the country
6106301 subsidies to fossil fuels will have to be phased out as part of the climate effort
6106302 the environmental cost of fossil fuels needs to be reflected in their price
6106303 having a strong budget surplus is an important buffer against international economic uncertainty
6106304 it was obvious back then that asset prices had fallen and the amount of deals they were doing was reducing so an earnings downgrade had to come
6106305 what did the company in was it had no idle capacity in their gearing structure that mean they geared as much as the market withstood but when the market turned down the company had little room to move

6106528 many thanks for all your efforts a quick couple of questions regarding the set of images that you are collecting have collected in order to seek advice regarding their possible status once the act is fully enacted do you already have in the collection images of the type to be seen on websites such as viciousvixens com femdon including breath control bondage smothering gwenmdedia ff bondage and breath control insex com no explanation necessary i guess kink com and affiliated sites etc etc

6106531 in a research article that graces the may cover of geology scientists at brown university think mars climate has been much more dynamic than previously believed after examining stunning high resolution images taken last year by the mars reconnaissance orbiter the researchers have documented for the first time that ice packs at least 1 kilometer 0 6 miles thick and perhaps 2 5 kilometers 1 6 miles thick existed along mars mid latitude belt as recently as 100 million years ago in addition the team believes other images tell them that glaciers flowed in localized areas in the last 10 to 100 million years akin to the day before yesterday in mars geological timeline
6106532 if you dont buy a hybrid and change your light bulbs youre destroying the planet

6106539 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
6106540 one of the things weve seen over and over again is that parents have difficulty getting redress if a child is paddled and severely injured or paddled in violation of parents wishes
6106541 international human rights law puts a pretty strong prohibition on corporal punishment
6106542 i didnt get any bruises but they still hurt and from that point on i told myself and my parents i wasnt going to take any more paddlings
6106543 just about everyone at the beginning of the year said if he or she gives you any trouble you can paddle them you can send them home and ill paddle them or you can have me come out to the school and we can both paddle them
6106544 its really just a part of the culture of the school environment there
6106545 the use of corporal punishment is associated almost overwhelmingly with negative effects and that it increases childrens problem behavior over time
6106546 we teach our children that violence is wrong yet corporal punishment teaches children that violence is a way to solve problems
6106547 it perpetuates a cycle of child abuse it teaches children to hit someone smaller and weaker when angry

6106557 guys usually have a problem expressing how they feel to each other so these kinds of films tap into that awkwardness
6106558 its a new age of awkward male relationships and were ushering it in i think
6106559 a bromance is essentially a romance between two straight male friends its not that theyre in love with each other its just that they have a deep feeling of affection for each other
6106560 at the end of superbad the two characters i mean say i love you they certainly are more forward about expressing their love for their friend butch and sundance wouldnt have done that

6106562 to us these movies are just basically a format for us to tell each other we love each other and we think how is that easily digestible you add in machineguns and mainstream movie accoutrements and then we can just hug each other all day and no one complains about it
6106563 if i were designing a system from scratch i would probably go ahead with a single payer system

6106591 and she does appear to be fat rather than pregnant a condition it has been suggested due to eating large quantities of fat and marrow and a sedentary life
6106592 if what the archaeologists tell us is true that stone age societies survived through hunting and gathering the chances are the women looked more like ms welch than ms willendorf whose obesity would have greatly impaired her ability to move around foraging and gathering the chances are a stone age woman much like the women in hunter gatherer tribes today such as the kung of the kalahari desert in south africa would not have had the opportunity to get that fat unless of course she had some special status she evidently did not need to gather or hunt but must have been catered to and had her needs met by others

6106604 the temptation to subject economic crimes to prolonged processes and the deliberation of committees not only delays justice but makes ultimate accountability less likely

6106622 our world is constantly changing with most changes brought about by globalisation it brought about the revolution in brand management and the advertising and pr industries and created a need for multi national brands to be understood and accepted by a local market and vice versa so for some local products and services there is a need to align themselves to the demands of a global market
6106623 our expertise in thinking globally while acting locally is visible in our strategic combination of pr and advertising activities placing global brands in the local south african market in our work for manpower we benefit from the knowledge accessible through manpower incorporated a global leader in employment services understanding the bigger picture and intensive research is necessary before implementing global recruitment trends in a local south african market
6106624 in preparing a brand or product to compete in the global market we take the client through a preparation process including research to confirm the positioning of the product or service in the international arena and the existing unique characteristics such as cultures and demographics that would affect the type of communication tools we use
6106625 whilst we co ordinated the public relations around the companys bee deal involving old mutual investment group sa to media and stakeholders we realised that there was huge potential from a global positioning perspective considering the kind of international projects anchor industries is involved in the brand design at that time did not reflect the size the business has grown to we developed a logo and look and feel that maintains existing design elements where possible whilst depicting anchor industries as a reliable global player
6106626 as active industry participants we pride ourselves on the high levels of knowledge and qualifications within our organisation the ongoing research of current trends as well as the experience gained through work completed for our b2b and b2c clients across various industries one size doesnt fit all the mistake too many managers make is to implement a standardised marketing strategy for local and global brands

6106724 e n van de feiten van het universum die verklaard dienen te worden zo kan gesteld worden is het verstand en het mag duidelijk dat niets anders het verstand kan hebben voortgebracht dan een verstand
6106725 ik heb geconcludeerd dat het bestaan van god evident is en dat mijn bestaan op alle momenten in mijn leven volledig van god afhankelijk is en dat ik denk dat de menselijke geest niets met een grotere bewijslast en zekerheid zou kunnen weten
6106726 alle dingen zijn uit het niets voortgekomen en bewegen zich voorwaarts tot in de oneindigheid wie kan een dergelijke verbazingwekkende loopbaan volgen de auteur van deze wonderen en alleen hij kan deze bevatten
6106727 het is waar dat een weinig filosofie het verstand van een mens naar het athe sme zal doen neigen maar een diepte in de filosofie leidt het verstand van een mens naar religie want ook al kijkt het verstand van een mens naar verstrooide secundaire oorzaken het kan hier soms blijven stilstaan en niet verder kijken maar wanneer de keten van deze oorzaken gezamenlijk en met elkaar verbonden worden beschouwd dan kan het verstand niets anders doen dan de toevlucht nemen tot de voorzienigheid en god
6106728 het totaal van alle mogelijke kennis over god is niet bereikbaar voor een menselijk wezen zelfs niet door een ware openbaring maar het ontdekken hoe ver onze rede kan gaan met betrekking tot de kennis over god is n van de meest waardige zoektochten
6106729 there is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about and that is not being talked about
6106730 there is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about and that is not being talked about
6106731 dat kan duiden op een gehoorbeschadiging werkt u in een lawaaierige omgeving of bent u veel in discotheken geweest
6106732 the u s has to adjust its mind set and appreciate that asia is finally becoming a force in international affairs and needs to be dealt with on its own terms there are plenty of specialists who understand the region but the prevailing tendency is to see the world through an atlantic lens this distorts washingtons understanding of regional developments and prevents the u s from successfully engaging asia
6106733 one of the problems is we generally apply our own standards of judgment when we look at other countries
6106734 the mind of the dreaming man is fully satisfied with whatever happens to it the agonizing question of possibility does not arise kill plunder more quickly love as much as you wish and if you die are you not sure of being roused from the dead let yourself be led events will not tolerate deferment you have no name everything is inestimably easy

6106737 i have been working on the endangered species act for 15 years and have never seen such a sneaky attack
6106738 with this change the bush administration threatens to undo more than 30 years of progress
6106739 this move is consistent with other efforts by the administration to cement industry friendly policies before leaving office in january
6106740 there is nothing that allows an agency of the federal government to not obey the endangered species act and the agencies are liable under civil and criminal penalties if they do not obey
6106741 proposed rule is consistent with the fws fish and wildlife service current understanding it is not possible to draw a direct causal link
6106742 it takes great hubris to resurrect an issue the court has already definitely struck down
6106743 this is like a zombie movie their proposal to toss the endangered species act over the cliff died but now has somehow come back to life
6106744 this is akin to a drug company suppressing results showing that a medicine is killing people and then trying to put the medicine broadly on the market
6106745 as president senator obama will fight to maintain the strong protections of the endangered species act and undo this proposal from president bush
6106746 after over 30 years of successfully protecting our nations most endangered wildlife like the bald eagle we should be looking for ways to improve it not weaken it

6106763 supposed to be on the dark dinghy and somber side
6106764 to find that it had been repainted top to bottom on rothmans orders the murky scuzzy vibe was gone and a brighter and less downish look had taken its place
6106765 at the very least given my confidence in the source it suggests that a creative tug of war is going on and that rothman one can reasonably gather feels a certain managerial slash territorial investment in the x men franchise
6106766 too many explosions too many colorfully cheesy shots and an unnecessary need to expand the story into a team of superheroes
6106767 you need a large brain with a lot of connectivity
6106768 if it had been a sparrow it would have been a problem
6106769 magpies are known for their ability to steal shiny objects and to hide away their loot its not too far fetched that a master thief like a magpie has that perspective taking ability
6106770 the temptation to subject economic crimes to prolonged processes and the deliberation of committees not only delays justice but makes ultimate accountability less likely
6106771 if you have high economic growth and a high level of corruption then corruption causes political contradictions that leads to the kind of difficulties we had in kenya at the end of last year
6106772 we have swept them under the carpet with committees and i know how this happened as i have served in government
6106773 these issues will not be resolved over night it will require a seismic shift

6106777 if i were a principal and a teacher had been in a dysfunctional school for 10 or 15 years given human nature i would probably be more careful about an interview than if that teacher had only been there a couple of years
6106778 its like this district feels they have absolutely no responsibility to their employees
6106779 the attitude is what do you care as long as youre paid well they do care
6106780 it isnt fair my friend but it just makes it easier for me to whup him
6106781 im looking toward the future now a future that looks very bright once we send twig legs back to the back bench
6106782 in archaic greece three figures the diviner the bard and the king of justice share the privilege of dispensing truth purely by virtue of their characteristic qualities
6106783 while hermeneutics may successfully explore the double register of hesiodic speech it refuses to understand memory and oblivion in their ethnographic and religious contexts
6106784 truth is defined at two levels conformity with logical principles and conformity with reality accordingly truth is inseparable from concepts of demonstration verification and experimentation
6106785 for the poet remembrance came through a personal vision that ensured direct access to the events his memory evoked his privilege was to enter into contact with the other world and his memory granted him the power to decipher the invisible thus memory was not simply the material basis for sung speech or the psychological function on which the formulary technique depended it was also and above all a religious power that gave poetic pronouncements their status of magicoreligious speech
6106786 a warriors worth was decided by the masters of praise the servants of the muses
6106787 a poet bestows through his praise a memory on a man who is not naturally endowed with it
6106788 truth is explicitly defined as a nonforgetfulness of the poets precepts
6106789 soon after he was taken to the oracle before entering however he paused at two neighboring springs called lethe and mnemosyne after the two religious powers that dominated the inspired poets system of thought the water from the first spring obliterated the memory of human life while the water from the second allowed the individual to remember everything he saw and heard in the otherworld
6106790 the speech of the diviner and of oracular powers like a poetic pronouncement defines a particular level of reality when apollo prophesies he realizes oracular speech does not reflect an event that has already occurred it is apart of its realization
6106791 magicoreligious speech is pronounces in the absolute present with no before or after a present that like memory incorporates that which has been that which is and that which will be this kind of speech eludes temporality because it is at one with forces beyond human ones forces that are completely autonomous and lay claim to an absolute power
6106792 pittheus is the inventor of rhetoric the art of persuasion and of using lying words that resemble reality
6106793 this second power of speech is dangerous since it may produce an illusion of reality
6106794 by turning memory into a positive technique and considering time as the framework for secular activity simonides dissociated himself form the entire religious tradition the tradition of both the inspired poets as well as the sects and philosophicoreligious circles
6106795 for the sophists memory is simply a secularized function whose development is essential to the kind of intelligence at work in both sophistry and politics
6106796 at this level of thought memory is not simply a gift of second sight that allows one to grasp the totality of past present and future even more important it is the terminus of the chain of reincarnations memorys powers are twofold as a religious power it is the water of life which marks the end of the cycle of metensomatoses as an intellectual faculty it constitutes the discipline of salvation that results in victory over time ad death and makes it possible to acquire the most complete kind of knowledge
6106797 memory is not simply a gift of second sight a decoding of the invisible that constantly interacts with the visible instead it becomes a means of transcending time and separating the soul from the body hence a method of acceding to something radically different from the visible world
6106798 memory is essential in an oral civilization and specific mnemonic techniques must be perfected
6106799 we are deeply saddened that leroi moore saxophonist and founding member of dave matthews band died unexpectedly tuesday afternoon august 19 2008 at in los angeles from sudden complications stemming from his june atv accident on his farm near

6106802 this will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of long range missile threats from countries like
6106803 missile defence of course is aimed at no one it is in our defence that we do this
6106804 we have to remember that western countries have certain values and principles in common
6106805 we have to stand up for these principles and we have to defend them
6106806 we will be forced to respond to this adequately the eu and us have been warned
6106807 our neighbours should now understand that our nation will never give in nor allow itself to be intimidated
6106808 obviously there is a certain environment you are operating in you cant deny it

6106941 as late as february 15th ed muskie was general conceded to be within an eyelash or two of having the democratic nomination so skillfully locked up that the primaries wouldnt even be necessary
6106942 he had the public endorsements of almost every big name in the party including some who said they were only backing him because he was so far ahead that nobody else had a chance
6106943 despite spending 100 million team clinton had somehow failed to establish ground operations in all but a handful of upcoming states

6106952 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed
6106953 both the size and pace of the withdrawal needs to increase and needs to increase sooner rather than later
6106954 we are beginning to see the early signs of some withdrawal it is not significant and it needs to increase
6106955 whether that is the beginning of a true withdrawal or some sort of token effort
6106956 there is a slight uptick in some of the numbers but this is not a new era of good feelings here these are still very low numbers all around
6106957 gas prices are going down and the olympics always provide a little burst of emotion
6106958 when you think congress is at rock bottom someone is there with a jackhammer
6106959 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6106960 that hairline difference between nuance and what appears to be flip flopping is hurting him with liberal voters
6106961 conservatives were supposed to be the bigger problem for mccain
6106962 obama still has work to do on his base at this point mccain seems to be doing a better job with his
6106963 there were no wild swings there isnt one group that is radically different than last month or even two months ago it was just a steady decline for obama across the board

6106970 reception like all a national glory for having filled the nation with joy
6106971 un recibimiento como toda una gloria nacional por llenar de alegr a a la naci n
6106972 it seems to me that dancap seeks to obtain the rights to control the sale of the theatres through this motion
6106973 it did not negotiate for this right in the term sheet
6106974 our position was validated by the judge and he seems to have accepted all of our arguments
6106975 he says that key brand has the right to sell and that we have a binding agreement to purchase
6106976 the polyketal microparticles we developed are simply a vehicle to get the drugs inside the body to the diseased area as quickly as possible
6106977 the major advantage to using these polyketals to deliver drugs is that they degrade into biocompatible compounds that dont accumulate in a patients tissue or cause additional inflammation
6106978 we think these microparticles are going to be fantastic for oral drug delivery because they can survive the stomach conditions before they release their contents in the intestines
6106979 patients with acute liver failure need drugs as soon as possible or else theyll die
6106980 weve tailored the polyketals hydrolysis rates to deliver the drug in one or two days
6106981 delivering proteins inside microparticles has been limited because getting the protein into the microparticles required organic solvents that frequently destroyed the proteins
6106982 to overcome this problem we developed a method of simply immobilizing the protein on the surface of the microparticles
6106983 couceiro has performed well in lithuania its important that he continues to live in our country
6106984 get to know one another in a fun and supportive atmosphere and to promote creative problem solving and team building skills
6106985 teams are expected to work together to define the problem and set specific goals brainstorm solutions evaluate the alternatives decide on a course of action and execute it
6106986 we want to get across the idea that an mba is more than books research papers tests and a diploma
6106987 ibwc prevented them from giving us the go ahead on this particular project
6106988 the majority of court members are disappointed because we thought it to be a viable alternative to the border fence
6106989 we cannot file lawsuits on behalf of private property owners
6106990 i just go that confirmed by our attorneys so we cannot do that but we can file litigation as it relates to our property
6106991 certainly its very important for the parents to also put their part into it and make sure that they dont get involved in any criminal activity especially in front of their children leading to these types of bad examples
6106992 we have teachers we have utpa professors we have police officers and so were very happy with the turnout
6106993 my strong lead was achieved without spending money on television radio or mailers now that the primary is behind us i am looking ahead to november and the task of ensuring that all voters are familiar with my strong record of fighting crime and protecting families
6106994 it is a great honor to have been selected as a recipient of the ralph e powe junior faculty enhancement award this award will be instrumental in my development of fluidic flexible matrix composites which are new material and structural systems that have the unique ability to change modulus on demand i believe these innovative materials will lead to new and exciting opportunities for both government and commercial applications
6106995 being a golfer i know a golf ball travels about 10 farther when hit at 5 000 6 000 feet above sea level clearly romo didnt have that factored in while in colorado based on his overthrows in practice and the game he should be okay at at 600 feet above sea level in valley ranch
6106996 i have always felt that a politician is to be judged by the animosities he excites among his opponents

6106998 um meister zu werden ist es ganz wichtig dass wir unsere heimspiele gewinnen
6106999 ich bin nun gekommen um mit bremen titel zu gewinnen und erfolg in der champions league zu haben das viertelfinale muss unser ziel sein
6107000 das war auch ein grund warum ich mich f r werder entschieden habe ich werde von der offensiven spielweise profitieren
6107001 ich wollte entweder in london bleiben oder bei einem verein spielen der wie bremen in der champions league dabei ist
6107002 wenn es gut f r mich l uft warum soll ich dann nicht l nger bleiben ich m chte auf keinen fall ein wandervogel werden
6107003 i think it reconfirms that mr chr tien and the liberals have always pursued a policy in this area calculated to their own personal financial interests and those of rich and powerful friends
6107004 its no mistake that mr chr tien was calculating his retirement income in his relations in this area it was a few weeks after he left the premiership that he was being signed on as a consultant to multinational companies with commercial interests in this area
6107005 i think we will see it workers becoming more skilled in more areas because employees know that those who have several strings to their bow will have an edge over their peers when it comes to the crunch
6107006 top quality contractors will always find work but there will now be increased pressure for them to demonstrate how good they are through recognised independent qualifications
6107007 i think we will see considerable growth in it support services because businesses can ill afford a serious technology fault downtime that costs money during testing economic times can break a company before it has time to act
6107008 we are likely to see continued acceleration of the restructuring of the industry towards higher level competencies that is good news for the industry as a whole but a threat to those unable to demonstrate they can operate at that high level
6107009 some 30 per cent of people who have resigned to take up other roles with new companies have been offered a revised package to remain with their current employer
6107010 of that 30 per cent 15 per cent have accepted and the increase offered has exceeded five per cent of their original salary
6107011 i believe the trend for contractors is sustainable in the short term despite the credit crunch however there are some sectors where contractor rates have stabilised and in some cases rates have fallen
6107012 the majority of projects we are working on are key to improving the performance of the companies we work with but it depends how much longer the credit environment continues it would be naive to think that the it sector will not be affected at some point if the crunch runs into the longer term
6107013 a typical effect for it in times of economic constraint is that firms delay non critical projects and this sort of response could affect workload in the short term but the extent to which it is at the heart of companies today means that the effect on the workforce may be less than it might have been some years ago
6107014 the credit crunch will certainly bring some changes and i do not believe the repercussions have even begun to be seen however businesses are smarter these days and we have seen reports where companies such as hsbc have praised their technology system for reducing the impact of the credit crunch
6107015 i also believe that if the industry continues to manage to survive this period without too many scars the impact on the industry will be hugely positive and we may see a renewed interest in graduates in the industry and related subjects
6107016 it is clear that the credit crunch has hit the uk hard we have seen a significant increase in interest for overseas job placements

6107036 and now these three remain faith hope and love but the greatest of these is love
6107037 commit everything you do to the lord trust him and he will help you

6107091 voters and legislators in the states from california to nevada to maine have decided to provide their residents suffering from chronic diseases and serious illnesses like aids and cancer with medical marijuana to relieve their pain and suffering
6107092 obama supports the rights of states and local governments to make this choice though he believes medical marijuana should be subject to u s food and drug administration regulation like other drugs
6107093 i dont think its a good use of federal law enforcement resources to be going after people who are supplying marijuana for medicinal purposes
6107094 what we should do is prioritize what the dea should be doing and that would not be a high priority theres a lot of other more important work that needs to be done
6107095 medical marijuana is not something that the quote people want
6107096 the tone of the discussion confirms that the interest rate debate remains finely balanced for now with most members concluding that the outlook for growth had worsened but that the risks to the inflation outlook remain on the upside

6107100 die zukunftsorientierte weiterentwicklung eines modernen bildungswesens ist eine daueraufgabe der sich bayern seit langem erfolgreich stellt unser ziel ist es unseren kindern bestm gliche und begabungsgerechte bildungschancen zu er ffnen und die unterrichtsversorgung weiter zu verbessern und die klassenst rken zu reduzieren bereits heute liegt die durchschnittliche klassenst rke bei den grundschulen bei unter 23 sch lern bei hauptschulen bei 21 sch lern bei realschulen und gymnasien bei 28 sch lern auch in der n chsten legislaturperiode wird das thema bildung vorfahrt haben wir werden hier eindeutig einen haushaltspolitischen schwerpunkt setzen
6107101 vom nationalen bildungsgipfel erwarte ich mir dass damit das thema bildung so wie in bayern bei den priorit tenlisten ganz nach vorne rutscht ich erwarte mir im herbst dass der bund wo er nach der f deralismuskommission kompetenzen hat diese auch intensiv ausf llt das bedeutet ein substanzielles insbesondere finanzielles engagement des bundes in den bereichen sprachf rderung f r migranten bernahme der kosten der mittagsverpflegung an den schulen f r bed rftige ma nahmen zur besseren verzahnung von schule und beruf weiterbildung und bei den forschungsausgaben
6107102 bayern legt mit seinen entscheidungen zur bildungspolitik die messlatte f r den nationalen bildungsgipfel bewusst hoch wir brauchen berall in deutschland h chstes niveau bei der bildung
6107103 die bildungspolitik von der kinderkrippe ber das schulwesen bis zum hochschulwesen steht im zentrum der regierungspolitik der staatsregierung

6107113 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
6107114 the democratic party also strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and post natal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
6107115 so if abortion is a test case of sen obamas ability to find common ground how did he do his team and allies did succeed in crafting a plank that opposing camps could agree on they showed skill at mediation and bridge building they made pro choicers feel comfortable taking a new step but reassuring them on their basic concerns they made pro lifers give in on several small points to get one big victory but they did all that in part by stripping the language of fire once you know the history and negotations its sort of an impressive accomplishment but to the naked eye its hardly a rallying cry for a third way
6107116 you must pray with all your might it means fervent effectual untiring wrestling with god it means grappling with omnipotence clinging to him following him about so to speak day and night as the widow did to the unjust judge until the answer comes and the end is gained this kind of prayer be sure the devil and the world and your own indolent unbelieving nature will oppose they will pour water on this flame they will talk about impossibilities and predict failures but if you mean to succeed you must shut your ears and eyes to all but what god has said and hold him to his own word you must pray with all your might
6107117 what we do with the promises of god is the tipping point in every area of our lives whether or not we decide to believe that we have access to the very power that raised christ from the dead will determine just how uncommon our lives turn out to be though we have trials his promises are true though we may not feel him at times hes still there and though the enemy would love for us to settle for less god gets absolutely giddy when we reach for more
6107118 a recent study for nasa estimated that by 2005 free flight could save the airlines nearly 4 billion a year bigger than the savings to airlines but a little harder to measure are the savings for passengers the value of a travelers time varies of course but a recent study by daniel brand a consultant and the chairman of the transportation research board of the national academy of science suggests that for a planeload of people it can run well over 100 a minute

6107155 smith has been a federal district judge since 1988 his record raises questions about his suitability for this important seat in 1997 smith refused initially to recuse himself from hearing a bank fraud case even though the claims implicated another bank where his wife was a vice president and where the couple had substantial financial assets instead in violation of federal judicial ethics smith issued a number of rulings in the case including several favorable to the banks before finally recusing himself smith long remained a member of a club that barred women even though by 1992 the federal code of judicial ethics specifically prohibited such membership only in late 1999 when the circuit court seat to which he has now been named first became vacant did smith obey the rules and resign
6107156 the not so dirty little secret of the senate is that we do consider ideology but privately if the president uses ideology in deciding whom to nominate to the bench the senate as part of its responsibility to advise and consent should do the same in deciding whom to confirm pretending that ideology doesnt matter or even worse doesnt exist is exactly the opposite of what the senate should do
6107157 the treatment of this fine man is an unfortunate chapter in the senates history

6107188 i think hell just want to be a celebrity whatever that means hell just have to keep improving if he wants to do that he handles himself so much better than he did i was just amazed at some of the answers he gave to a lot of these questions this time

6107205 youve got to have some capacity to cover sporting costs
6107206 north korea is no 1 in the world when it comes to uniformity they are uniform beyond belief these kind of traditional synchronized movements result in a sense of beauty we chinese are able to achieve this as well through hard training and strict discipline
6107207 in one week we could only work four and a half days we had to have coffee breaks twice a day couldnt go into overtime and just a little discomfort was not allowed because of human rights

6107209 yeah so what i abused and destroyed chinas finest performers in the name of one time spectacle going to do about it

6107212 we have to grow the pie the biggest way of quickly growing the pie is in the media area the feeling is that we would get greater revenue for media if we had more regular season games
6107213 its always negotiable but certainly theyd have to pay us more for 18 regular season games
6107214 it s possible in 2012 we may start seeing all nfl games streamed online
6107215 it did not take long for the discussion to center on the olympics with espn executives questioning nbcs decision to tape delay programming from michael phelps races on the west coast to the opening ceremony
6107216 when we put a live bug on sportscenter it means live right now at espn it just would not be part of our dna to tape delay the most important sporting event of the day
6107217 im glad to see that nbc has adopted that approach with the olympics because it validates the approach weve taken for years
6107218 espn is interested in bidding for the next round of olympic games 2014 and 2016 which will take place before october 09
6107219 penguins owner mario lemieuxs threats about moving the franchise if somebody else didnt pony up the cash how arrogant and how classless to say so on the very day that ground was broken for a facility that will line the pockets of the penguins with gold
6107220 the suckers that most public officials are came up with a mix of public gambling and private dollars lemieux calls the moving threats a negotiating tactic but lets call it what it was a lie
6107221 national parliaments play a key role in supporting policies that foster closer integration of asean countries and in particular the implementation of asean agreements which in several member countries have to be ratified by the legislature

6107231 the opposition are keeping quiet now because they are terrified of doing moscows work
6107232 but as soon as the russians are out of the country saakashvili is finished
6107233 mr miliband said it was a wise decision of the opposition not to raise problems during the occupation but he also said that he understood that it would soon be time for normal political life to return
6107234 saakashvili bears part of the responsibility for this war russia was trying to provoke us but we should have avoided direct military confrontation
6107235 im afraid it will not be very easy for the government to answer all the questions
6107236 im still holding my breath to see if obama will get the treatment he deserves being possibly the only person who could walk the racial tightrope needed for this country
6107237 all mccain has to do is sit back and see how the race relations play out
6107238 flash popularity thing does not bode well for him enduring the challenges
6107239 its really that obama seems ready to lie when hes under scrutiny that gets to me
6107240 i honestly believe if we vote obama in hell be assassinated and well be back to where we started politically
6107241 if theres anything to his muslim background then wed have al qaeda working on our country from the top down
6107242 its an ingenious device the voice we can use it to call out to draw in to make beautiful uncomfortable motions
6107243 the only thing i dont like is when people say that my voice is an acquired taste
6107244 if it was a woman singing they would just say it sounds pretty
6107245 i really dont feel its important to associate a persons gender with their voice or their music
6107246 does it really matter if its a man or woman who has written your favorite book or painted a favorite picture to me it most certainly doesnt and i dont think it should be any different with music not everything in music needs an explanation or a why i like art theres mystery to it
6107247 again today the democratic house leadership is proving that they are out of touch with the needs of their constituents by skipping town for more than a month without a vote to lower gas prices to increase supply of american made energy and to promote energy independence
6107248 the democratic party is owned and directed by radical environmental groups
6107249 tonight i want to have an unpleasant talk with you about a problem unprecedented in our history with the exception of preventing war this is the greatest challenge our country will face during our lifetimes
6107250 we must not be selfish or timid if we hope to have a decent world for our children and grandchildren
6107251 we simply must balance our demand for energy with our rapidly shrinking resources by acting now we can control our future instead of letting the future control us
6107252 some will cause you to put up with inconveniences and to make sacrifices
6107253 the most important thing about these proposals is that the alternative may be a national catastrophe further delay can affect our strength and our power as a nation
6107254 of course the congressman did not mention that he owns considerable acreage a few miles from georgetown acreage that might increase handsomely in value if an oil terminal and refinery were sited in the area
6107255 why the hell doesnt it cause an alarm its fucking obvious this is an epidemic and its rising every year
6107256 it was a simple calculation made with simple division i took the number of cases of autism service provided by state public schools and divided it by the number of children enrolled
6107257 people call it a study but its not really a study anybody can do it but what concerns me about it is that autism is affecting a far greater amount of kids than the cdc reports
6107258 but what worries me is that the number is only going up all the data points to this but the government is still using a number that is seven years old
6107259 its all based on classifying behaviors and these classifications vary between states so you have a fuzzy way of classifying with severe cases there is no problem but thats different when determining mild forms
6107260 the fact that we dont have a population based system at the public health level makes it that much more difficult to address such questions like prevalence
6107261 we sat in an office in a high rise in new york with a top music attorney who represented all the greats through the ages
6107262 it was when the backstreet boys and nsync were happening and he said hey guys if you hang in there im sure haircuts and guitars will come back but right now theres no avenue for this and he was so right
6107263 when we first started as a band the boring americana scene was happening
6107264 it all just sounded kinda like a beer commercial to me people would say about us theyre the americana band for people that dont like americana but at the time i wasnt into no depression magazine and all that
6107265 thats what im still hopeful for but you never know the way things go with making records
6107266 thats why we got together to play these shows just to play and gel and find our group spirit well get our mojo working make a killer record thats relevant for us and hopefully thatll mean something to other people
6107267 its good because everyones best ideas are one or two things so you get four or five people with one or two really good ideas
6107268 i like albums to be 35 to 40 minutes with 11 or 12 songs im not into big epic 17 song red hot chili peppers albums
6107269 its not a look or a particular sound its just a shared vibe that we all had the fortune to experience
6107270 now that all this time has passed whats left is whats real
6107271 hi hon its me and your dad again we are up at the hardware store and were going to pick up a part for your hot water heater to see if dad can fix it
6107272 well i think your daddy wants to come over and
6107273 what am i doing to make my life great today
6107274 the only thing you need to know is that hamlet is a play written by shakespeare that is revered and that making a sequel to it is a bad idea
6107275 if you can get your head around that youll enjoy the movie if that means nothing to you its probably not for you
6107276 not everyone who went and saw the dark knight is going to come and see this film
6107277 its not for all those people but its for some of those people who want to see something a bit different
6107278 sometimes you have thoughts as we all do that we know arent so healthy
6107279 normal human beings rational people edit those thoughts so that they dont offend people but i love performing those characters because its quite liberating being able to say the sorts of things you ought not to say its cathartic theres a strange perverse pleasure when you meet real people who behave in a way thats simply not acceptable when i encounter someone who is rude for no apparent reason part of me is obviously offended and appalled but part of me is amused and curious and interested their one mitigating factor is they dont quite know what an idiot theyre being
6107280 oh my god dude did she just piss on the floor
6107281 they were saying its inexcusable to pee on someones work but its also soooo 80s
6107282 this guy put our video up on his blog and people had already been debating the morality of people peeing on another artists piece but they have no idea if we actually did it they just assumed
6107283 we saw these two lame birds flying around on another submitted video and instantly we knew we had to do a parody of it
6107284 so suddenly it was a parody party and we were out in the backyard having fun making fun of the other entries
6107285 and i went up to the getty courtyard where there was this big party with beer and djs and stuff but then they had this little sign that said video revolutionaries with a little arrow pointing down so you go down the stairs and around the basement and theres this little room where theyre playing the videos and theres like four people in there
6107286 but the whole experience changed the trajectory of our work
6107287 the thing about youtube is that its kind of like the wild wild west its ever changing and evolving were not even scratching the surface of what we could do were still completely underground so to speak
6107288 which given that we had only come up with the campaign 15 days in advance i think that wasnt bad and theres a lasting effect too last week we had about 1 300 to 1 400 views of that channel one of the videos had been watched over 700 times this was an experiment but were going to keep using youtube to keep getting messages out and our big message now is what people love about tijuana
6107289 people will pass on the video or theyll watch the whole documentary which is up on google right now and thats been the best way to get our story out there
6107290 so thats another funny random way that youtube is helping us
6107291 i was like oh my gosh who are you whats your name
6107292 and i told him were going to make workout videos thatll blow everyones minds
6107293 we put a lot of work into planning these things and the peoples reactions
6107294 we get a sense of happiness and laughter during the mission but by sharing them on youtube it gives them an entire second life and people who werent there get to experience it
6107295 i just bought an apple tv do you know what that is its kind of like an internet cable box that you use with your tv so i actually cancelled my cable and with this thing you can watch any youtube video and you can download any television show you want to watch through the itunes store so a couple nights ive got home from work and just got sucked into youtube because you sit on your couch and youre watching youtube with the remote and the big tv you know and its a much different experience than watching them on your computer screen i do watch a good amount of youtube i guess
6107296 its good to do a video instead of a taped interview because so much is communicated with body language and peoples facial expressions as well as the settings and you just cant get that on a taped interview plus you can take the information a video that you use for the material in your article and you can actually make a whole separate medium out of it you can go from print to web and make a video feature
6107297 what i find to be the best part of youtube is that response video idea because what it does is make this community possible you see this link you see that this is a parody of that and you see how everything relates
6107298 no one has parodied our parodies yet but we hope they will
6107299 its the most recent album so by default its my favorite but even taking off the goggles that warp my own perception of what ive done to me it is a way more realized project than anything ive done by a lot i think i did the best writing and rapping of my life on that record
6107300 i realize people will have their favorite records songs from my past but a lot of that is based on what you heard first where you were when you heard it etc when all this is done and the lps and eps are weighed against one another in hindsight i really think none shall pass will stand out
6107301 but thats just me ill probably hate it as soon as i finish whatever i do next
6107302 basically this upcoming tour is going to be our last u s run for a while after which i plan on locking myself back in the studio to focus on solo material
6107303 the show weve started rehearsing incorporates some old stuff we havent done in a long long time some slightly more obscure stuff as well as some none shall pass songs weve never played before
6107304 rob is a like minded dude really great guy and amazing mc producer that is criminally slept on
6107305 we get along really well and the chemistry is there so it feels pretty natural to continue ive never had a hype man i always found it better to take another artist with me someone who can stand on their own and rock me him and dj big wiz really have a good understanding of how to be on stage together at this point so its just a comfortable situation that is pretty beneficial to everyone
6107306 but got to choose the colors materials and could pretty much do anything design wise
6107307 its cool cuz its something my mom will understand and think is cool
6107308 sometimes i do stuff and she just doesnt get it because the world im in means nothing to her but putting my name on a shoe will be cool to her and i like that

6107316 incredible performance by usain bolt once again he finished up in an incredible time this was an incredible performance he wanted that record
6107317 he got an incredible start i looked at his start and just went wow it was more amazing than the 100 metres guys that tall should not be able to start like that
6107318 he wanted that record this is his favourite event he went for it he came in focused on it knowing he would most likely win the gold
6107319 with my time and your money to waste we have nothing to lose

6107330 the opportunity to merge with linksman came at the perfect time we were getting plans rolling for next season and linksman has the resources to help g r i p on its path of continual growth
6107331 mike has been on board with g r i p since the beginning he is an industry veteran with great business sense g r i p will continue to be a favorite brand of recreational golfers in mikes experienced hands
6107332 we have completed twenty nine events in 2008 including our tournament of champions and most recently our third major of the season the tgaa summer classic we have averaged 40 players per event this is significant since as professionals we play in all conditions cold heat rain and yes even some snow we cap our fields at forty eight 48 players we find that this size field allows all players and especially those players in the early groups to be able to stay enjoy the company of other tgaa professionals and observe the results as the other groups return their cards we feel this adds to the overall enjoyment and excitement of tournament golf as it creates the same experience that a pga lpga nationwide or champions tour player feels when they are the leader in the clubhouse waiting patiently and excitedly as the players behind them complete their rounds
6107333 for 2008 we have forty 40 events on the schedule thirty five one day events four two day events and one three day event the five multi day events include our tournament of champions event three majors and the crown jewel of the season the tgaa tour championship all of our one day events are scheduled on weekends to accommodate our members careers in may we scheduled one day events on both saturdays and sundays on alternating weekends thereby bringing tournaments closer to our players
6107334 with the recent rise in gasoline prices it is important that we minimize the cost to the tgaa tour player while maximizing the experience like everyone else were keeping a watchful eye on economic conditions while at the same time positioning the tgaa as the premier pro net tour in the country tgaa promotes carpooling and other energy saving programs and our players have responded accordingly this allows our players to be more environmentally responsible a tgaa core business value
6107335 throughout the past twelve years we have seen many tours come and go throughout the mid atlantic many of them have attempted to replicate our tgaa business model there are several factors that have placed us head and shoulders above them all the most important is the quality service to our members and their guests that along with abiding by a set of standards that are neither subjective nor arbitrary we include the players through independent handicap and players committees everything we do can be statistically proven and has the supporting data and rationale consistent with the governing bodies of this game we love
6107336 were excited about the events leading up to competitive play
6107337 while the championship is obviously the main focus weve got some fun and exciting activities throughout the week that should keep fans entertained before play starts friday

6107345 todos os dias celebro a missa ou o confiss es e visito os doentes aos domingos h tr s ou quatro missas em locais seleccionados de modo a que muitas pessoas possam assistir

6107351 antes de ir para a universidade sent amos um grande desejo de evangelizar os alunos mas se queremos ficar muito tempo na universidade temo de ter cuidado e evitar o risco de sermos descobertos
6107352 por vezes somos descobertos e temos de mudar de casa
6107353 por vezes os seminaristas da igreja patri tica juntavam se n s temos de ser prudentes nesta situa o porque receamos que eles sejam espi es
6107354 a nossa maior dificuldade n o ter professores o reitor do semin rio ensina um pouco de tudo mas no final acabamos por m o conseguir ensinar nada devidamente outro problema a falta de bons livros para estudar
6107355 n o tinha medo era normal ser perseguido se n o tivesse sido perseguido teria sido um milagre

6107359 em geral os fi is preferem igrejas em estilo europeu que proclamam que a nossa f vem de roma mas o nosso bispo encorajou nos a construir em estilo chin s como sinal da acultura o da f cat lica na cultura chinesa
6107360 a igreja cat lica cumpre as suas promessas apoiaram nos desde o in cio da constru o at ao fim se no in cio o governo tinha criticas a fazer no final depois de ter falado com v rios funcion rios p blicos respons veis deixaram nos avan ar
6107361 nesta rea existem muitos crist os que s o cidad os modelo as autoridades reconhecem este facto e n o interferem nas actividades da igreja a reputa o dos crist o aqui de pessoas exemplares no respeito pela lei
6107362 o n mero de pessoas que diz acreditar em algum tipo de sistema religioso mais elevado do que esper vamos na china actualmente as pessoas est o mais abertas para se exprimirem nestes aspectos enquanto que antes provavelmente teriam hesitado em exprimir se como seno ou n o religiosas
6107363 esper vamos que as pessoas em reas economicamente mais pr speras manifestassem um menor interesse religioso mas n o esse o caso para nossa surpresa n o existe paralelo entre a situa o religiosas e a situa o de sucesso econ mico
6107364 o governo mostrou mais aten o ao papel das religi es na constru o da chamada sociedade harmoniosa socialista houve no passado atitudes mais negativas e inibit rias

6107386 officials concerned are working through the process of putting him on the plane to take him out of the country but if he continues to refuse to leave then he will confined in the airport transit area temporarily before being taken into a detention centre
6107387 pretty hard to imagine it would be legitimate for him to travel abroad again
6107388 i dont want any sex offenders in this country but the point is vietnamese officials have deported him to the uk so as we do whenever sex offenders return to this country we need to plan for what happens when people return
6107389 never mind his individual case anybody who is returning to the uk in these sorts of circumstances would be met at the airport by police officers would be served with an order which effectively puts them on to the sex offenders register
6107390 one of the things we have learned generally about sex offenders is they do want to travel to places where they can exploit children
6107391 if there is evidence the person is travelling abroad to abuse children we can get an order that stops them travelling there should be more of those
6107392 in every single case the court has to make the decision but this is the type of case where i find it pretty hard to imagine it is legitimate for him to travel abroad again
6107393 i think its right that we use police time to monitor sex offenders
6107394 if you are a british citizen you have the right to use the nhs whatever we think about an individual and this is a pretty despicable person
6107395 the last information we have is that shortly before the flight to the uk departed he declined to board

6107399 many pensions belong to working class people without other savings who will be counting pennies in their retirement for these people keeping up with the price of eggs is very important and investing in equities over the past decade has turned out to be a pretty gruesome decision im not sure if its possible for a pension fund to benchmark a food basket but there are lots of fund managers out there who are responsible for the life savings and wellbeing of people who are going to spend their retirements living on low incomes such managers might well want to start spending less time looking at absolute returns and more time keeping an eye on the cost of living and how it might be hedged

6107493 people arent looking at the rearview mirror on inflation or the yield on the 10 year would be well above 4 right now the inflation concern has moved away a bit
6107494 inflation pressures may have eased slightly but more important is the outlook for the economy
6107495 it will remain weak the situation in housing will pressure economy well into next year

6107762 the themes you took from me are working great painting obama as an elitist and out of touch celebrity when were rich celebrities too turning his big rallies and pretty words into character flaws charging him with playing the race card that one always cracks me up and accusing the media especially nbc of playing favorites its easy to get the stupid press to navel gaze theyre so insecure

6107808 research firm gartners latest figures show mac sales grew 52 per cent in the second quarter nearly six times the rate of the pc industry overall

6107861 african american students are punished at 1 4 times the rate that would be expected given their numbers in the student population

6107889 tank drownings are not all that common but they are completely preventable so we need to make people aware
6107890 i was going for a walk around my neighbourhood and an underground tank was being installed in a driveway my immediate thought was how easy it would be for a child to undo the lid and get in
6107891 they lean over fall in cant be seen and drown quite quietly its scary how quickly they can get into problems research shows they drown in a matter of minutes
6107892 but any body of water potentially can be a drowning hazard for children approximately 5cm of water which is basically their nose is all it takes to drown a child

6107897 they werent matters that were raised with me they were raised within the context of the submission
6107898 im just a member of parliament who had some responsibilities at the time and there is an inquiry and im happy to wait for the result of the inquiry
6107899 they are a thoroughly professional organisation but sometimes mistakes are made
6107900 this is unusual and important because it gives us great insight into the articles actually carried by australian soldiers into battle
6107901 it really is a snapshot of an aussie soldier because he was killed fell to the ground and covered with dirt and that was the last anyone saw of him until 90 years later when these guys dug him up
6107902 most of the times we have played in sri lanka it is not a bowlers paradise especially for the fast bowlers full credit to the fast bowlers for coming out with flying colours in tough conditions they bowled in right areas
6107903 in the last two games seamers got help but they may not get these conditions in the coming three games
6107904 it was turning a bit also so it was a bit tough when in one end we had a batsman but in other end it was open with the tailenders of course it was a concerned area till the match got over
6107905 many women find the idea of looking at it in great detail to be yucky

6107907 i speak for the majority of her family when i say her presence will not be missed by many very few tears will be shed and there will be no lamenting over her passing
6107908 her family will remember dolores and amongst ourselves we will remember her in our own way which were mostly sad and troubling times throughout the years we may have some fond memories of her and perhaps we will think of those times too
6107909 but i truly believe at the end of the day all of us will really only miss what we never had a good and kind mother grandmother and great grandmother i hope she is finally at peace with herself
6107910 as for the rest of us left behind i hope this is the beginning of a time of healing and learning to be a family again
6107911 there will be no service no prayers and no closure for the family she spent a lifetime tearing apart we cannot come together in the end to see to it that her grandchildren and great grandchildren can say their goodbyes so i say here for all of us good bye mom

6107918 i started the site for a simple reason i felt ill served by the undemocratic gatekeeping mentality so prevalent in our society and at that time we seemed to be on an inexorable march toward war with no avenue for dissent there was an assumption by the powers that be that the rest of the citizen body couldnt think for ourselves that we needed self appointed and so called experts to tell us what to think what to do and what we should or should not know for far too long these gatekeepers controlled the national conversation
6107919 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything

6107958 our research clearly shows that 40 of people from british ethnic communities keep in touch with their families back home by calls or text an extremely costly habit to maintain we are therefore very excited to launch this campaign as part of the programme we have launched an exclusive expat survival guide blog www vykehome com offering first hand advice on coping with homesickness and adapting to life in the uk sourav himself will be writing a number of the blogs we are extremely excited to have sourav on board as his global lifestyle and strong connection with friends and family make him the perfect vyke user and ambassador
6107959 what happens if the url is too long for the server
6107960 this is evident from a large number of factors including its lack of responsiveness to the needs of its airline customers and a lack of initiative in planning capacity
6107961 this has resulted in investment that is not tailored to the requirements of airport users and lower levels and quality of service for both airlines and passengers
6107962 monopolies clearly dont work and the baa monopoly has done huge damage to competition and the traveling public and it is high time it was broken up
6107963 this is not the end of the competition commission process
6107964 we will continue to point out to the commission the many areas where we believe its analysis is flawed and its remedies would be disproportionate and counterproductive
6107965 they dont have insight on how bad losses are going to get
6107966 i wouldnt say were flush with cash but from a budgetary surplus standpoint were in much better shape than places like california
6107967 im not at all upset because other taxes have risen to offset it and i have no desire to tax people for more than the state of texas needs
6107968 taxpayers have a fiscal and legitimate interest in paying no more new taxes than they have to
6107969 there may be more deductions available to taxpayers than we predicted
6107970 no one really wants to pay tax everybody wants an exemption everybody wants a credit but weve got services that government has to provide and everybody wants the services
6107971 we have to say where is the money coming from
6107972 until the special committee receives the offer or completes its review it will not comment on the offer nor will it speculate as to any future course of action it or the company may take
6107973 i believe that our value proposition will continue to attract more members as well as to deliver increased frequency
6107974 because the majority of bjs sales are derived from non discretionary items we have been able to generate strong top line growth in a challenging macro environment
6107975 i believe that our value proposition will continue to attract more members as well as to deliver increased frequency

6107978 keith has wanted someone who agrees with him after his show he was pushing to get joe scarborough out and that continued after dan took that time slot
6107979 its not about dan or about joe its about keith congratulations keith olbermann you now run msnbc
6107980 every public school needs effective methods of discipline but beating kids teaches violence and it doesnt stop bad behavior
6107981 corporal punishment discourages learning fails to deter future misbehavior and at times even provokes it
6107982 when you talk to local school officials they point to the fact that its quick and its effective and thats true
6107983 it doesnt take much time to administer corporal punishment and you dont have to hire someone to run a detention or an after school program
6107984 we need forms of discipline that makes children understand why what they did was wrong
6107985 teachers may have overcrowded classrooms and lack resources such as counselors to assist with particularly disruptive students or classroom dynamics
6107986 corporal punishment is not effective at the junior and senior high school levels and i do not recommend its application
6107987 it can be useful for elementary students especially with amateur clowns as opposed to hard core troublemakers for this reason i am opposed to abolishing spanking in elementary schools because we have systematically eliminated the tools with which teachers have traditionally backed up their word were now down to a precious few lets not go any further in that direction
6107988 most parents like this because it takes care of the punishment it gets the kids back in class it doesnt disrupt instruction its like the quick and dirty way of dealing with discipline problems
6107989 it works on some and it doesnt work on others
6107990 if youre one of the individuals that it does work on yes it will become a deterrent
6107991 i dont think its the schools place to make decisions like that
6107992 im not necessarily in favor of that kind of punishment in the house either but i feel like if somebody makes that decision it should be the parent
6107993 some were obviously laden most of them seemed to be empty riding high on their suspension
6107994 and there was no sign of armored vehicles or of artillery
6107995 three times medvedev has said they are starting the withdrawal and they have not
6107996 we cannot accept this kind of blindness not accepting international law
6107997 the territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognized borders
6107998 after lots of complaints about iphone 3g connection issues apple released a firmware update monday with hopes it would fix the issues but early reports suggest it
6107999 after complaining to a manager goodman was able to get a replacement unit but the reception issues persisted on thursday he was told by an at amp t customer service representative that its cell towers are having trouble recognizing the iphone 3g on the network and that a fix was forthcoming
6108000 we have no firm indications the russian troop withdrawal has really begun
6108001 people think it was just a certain group of players like quarterback andre woodson or wide receiver keenan burton
6108002 but i feel weve got the same amount of talent out here now when those guys went down we had guys that came in behind them and still made the plays
6108003 i believe we have become a better team over the last three years and i dont see us going back downhill to where we were
6108004 its like when you get a taste of it all you think about is wanting more
6108005 for the most part he makes really good decisions that hopefully will continue to improve with more reps
6108006 hes trying to do the right things and hes made significant progress
6108007 i just want to connect with them let them know that im there for them that they can call me for anything
6108008 with big names people felt like we relied on them to get the job done
6108009 but now i feel like everybody feels they are involved and are going to get a piece of this pie
6108010 maybe our offense isnt going to be scoring 37 38 points a game this year but we dont plan on giving up a lot of points to where they have to score 38 points
6108011 we feel like the pendulum has swung a little bit back around to our side of the ball
6108012 we need to continue to climb the ladder and knock off some teams we havent had some success with
6108013 we need to continue to try and climb up the pecking order for some years we were a patsy and thats no longer true
6108014 im just taking everything step by step enjoying the ride
6108015 i really want to spend as much time with my friends and family as i can
6108016 its coming up on two months on the road i want to be able to see them and just relax
6108017 well my careers over lets toast all downhill from here
6108018 my friends in the car business so hes going to help me
6108019 ive been looking at some aston martins and some maseratis it would be pretty sweet to get an old school aston martin some of the old school james bond ones that would be sick
6108020 it kind of bugs me im always getting rocked i need to get my video game skills up thats for sure
6108021 i would rather it be three months but i wanted it to be five so that it was probably longer than he wants and when he comes back hes really ready to come back
6108022 hes on his own now he makes all the decisions outside the pool and i take care of the pool
6108023 in athens he had never had any personal freedom at all now hes had a lot and hes screwed it up and hes learned what that means hes done a pretty good job with it i had my doubts in the beginning that we were going to get there but now i think hes got it down
6108024 it sounds really cliched but its true hes really grown as a human being
6108025 that in itself is going to serve him well as he makes these decisions in the upcoming few months and few years
6108026 i think hell just want to be a celebrity whatever that means hell just have to keep improving if he wants to do that he handles himself so much better than he did i was just amazed at some of the answers he gave to a lot of these questions this time
6108027 im happy to help him out if he wants a hand with some of these things
6108028 i think its just distant i dont think its good or bad theres not much there
6108029 its like michael said the other day debbie wants to go to rome i want to go to rome thats why were going
6108030 itll just be what it is he could probably do without it
6108031 we just have to play it by ear and see how things go but definitely start some new events and see where it takes us
6108032 i talk about him in every interview i want to meet him
6108033 hes that one guy i really really wanted to meet my whole life
6108034 i did not apply at first i waited a month and kept waiting
6108035 i spent a lot of time thinking and praying and just trying to figure out what was my calling what did i need to do
6108036 my intention is one year i am not closing a door but i am not stepping into a door
6108037 the transition has been wonderful this staff is truly the best staff ive worked with
6108038 i think it helped me because i already knew them and they already knew me
6108039 being a colleague on the same level as a teacher is different than being the boss
6108040 im still who i am i still have the same values but now im the enforcer whereas before i was one of the ones following the rules
6108041 those committees have outlined things that they want to do this year and my goal is to see that the committee work gets done
6108042 a combination pack hopes is attractive to the areas non catholic community
6108043 its a christian atmosphere where the kids are taught respect for each other where the kids are taught to care about their community and care about the people around them
6108044 we teach service as well as academics so we want really smart people to go out and help the community
6108045 theyre feeling me out were getting used to each other
6108046 they know me from class last year its just different as a principal
6108047 i dont know is about the best i can do
6108048 ive never seen a guy where he has the ball at his feet
6108049 and gets a yellow card for knocking someone down who was going after the ball because he slid i dont know
6108050 this was a little bit out of our routine we have school starting tomorrow and it showed
6108051 we have to play with a little more intensity than what we played with tonight
6108052 and we have to know what were doing a little bit better i dont know if it was because of the night or what but things were just off
6108053 were bringing back several seniors and several juniors but we have a whole new starting lineup
6108054 weve lost several players over the last couple of years and its going to take us some time to learn how to play together like a team right now were going to learn how to play as a team
6108055 he spent the last two years on jv and he learned from carpenter carpenter has also worked with him over the summer some there are a lot of little things that he hasnt picked up on we caught that today we pulled him off today and talked to him about it and hes going to be right back out there thursday
6108056 emmanuel nfor and ian colton both seniors and goss a sophomore
6108057 michael is the younger one coming in hes learning it he learned a little last year and hes going to be really good
6108058 hes just a ball of fire he just goes and goes and goes he gets the ball and puts it in the back of the net in ways you cant believe
6108059 ian is just rock steady hes going to be there and hes our captain right now he is that consistent player that you want out there
6108060 these guys are just coming together for the first time
6108061 once we gel were going to be really tough weve had glimpses of it and even in this game right after the second half we had three or four shots on goal but then we just lost it were still looking for that senior leadership
6108062 thats our team goal every year thats just above 500 and it gives you good momentum going into the postseason
6108063 i have to get back to work this is it
6108064 you may notice something different about the way im writing its fancy this is the font i type in now that im married
6108065 i do a lot of things differently now i say i do a lot for example who wants to do pilates i do would you like a mountain dew i do do you know why i pulled you over i do and that was just this morning
6108066 the love we felt from the people surrounding us and the love we have for each other made this the most beautiful and emotional day and one that well never forget
6108067 what can i say im the luckiest girl in the world shes officially off the market no one else gets her and now shell cook and clean for me
6108068 played with heart from start to finish and never gave up
6108069 the increase that were getting from the tax is just based on assessments
6108070 due to the assessments the school will generate more dollars than it did last year
6108071 i cant imagine anyone would complain that we have reduced those tax rates
6108072 this is not a situation where you walk out of the courtroom feeling victorious
6108073 inspector general of the marine corps review of body composition programs indicates we still have marines that fail to meet body composition standards
6108074 this impacts combat efficiency and effectiveness and unfortunately is a clear indicator of some commanders failure to enforce standards
6108075 its not often that we have to do a hump across the desert but we sure have to sprint like this in urban combat
6108076 how often do you actually do the motion in a leg curl
6108077 you ought to be able to take a shot of beer legally
6108078 we do think in the end this needs to be regulated at the federal level rather than as a patchwork of state regulations
6108079 i like this speech it really tells us what the character
6108080 one thing i like about your writing is that you know where to put an act break

6108197 everyone who knows me knows i can be a jokester but i guess i took it too far
6108198 i never meant to say anything rude about michael i am 100 percent sorry for what i said i take full responsibility for it
6108199 my diet has a lot to do with getting in shape i have no sugar i dont even eat fruit because of the sugar i eat chicken salmon and rice i eat avocados ill have egg whites for breakfast and turkey burgers for lunch i try to do 1 200 calories a day it may not sound like much but its actually a lot if you eat the right things
6108200 if you do vigorous workouts plus this eating program it is possible to lose 12 pounds in 30 days in a healthy non fad like way
6108201 t he practice of arbitrary imprisonments have been in all ages the favorite and most formidable instruments of tyranny
6108202 somebodys got to walk the line in the country theyve got to walk it unapologetically and im sure johnny cash would have been a john mccain supporter if he was still around
6108203 it is appalling to me that people still want to invoke my fathers name five years after his death to ascribe beliefs ideals values and loyalties to him that cannot possibly be determined and to try to further their own agendas by doing so
6108204 this is especially dangerous in the case of political affiliation it is unfair and presumptuous to use him to bolster any platform
6108205 were going in and were going to take care of this for these guys
6108206 thank you and well done for posting a bit of rationality amongst all the media hysteria surrounding this news item
6108207 some of the reports ive read state that the mortality rate for all patients treated at aiims not just children is 4
6108208 over 100 babies saved by taking part in clinical trials
6108209 the other key point that the mass media appears to have missed is that it is surely better to treat children with medicines that have been explicitly studied in other children not simply prescribed off label based on extrapolations from studies conducted in adults
6108210 it is disappointing that every other report or comment that ive seen on this item takes a sensationalist view rather than your more rational one
6108211 but if the potential displayed in the trailers is fulfilled the new tnt show raising the bar which debuts sept
6108212 the air and artillery bombardment left the provincial capital without water food electricity and gas horrified civilians crawled out of the basements into the streets as fighting eased looking for supplies
6108213 inflation has clearly put pressure on economic growth equity markets and the interest rate environment and that could have a short term softening effect
6108214 it is important for inflation in latin america to be better managed going forward for life insurance to be successful
6108215 at some point we could see some softening in latin america but so far so good at least in our lines of business
6108216 the leading edge of the baby boomers in the us who are now in their early sixties are beginning to retire and draw down on their savings whereas in latin america a good part of those 425mn people will still set aside assets for retirement for years to come
6108217 in the short run our focus is more on integrating and consolidating these acquisitions so i think you might see us slow down a little on acquisitions in the short term
6108218 but we will continue to look at bolt on acquisitions in latin america in the pension area or asset management or life and annuities
6108219 we needed a new facility in the united states to build on our global success with polybatch
6108220 we intend to be a leader with this product line in the u s market just as we are an established leader in europe and mexico
6108221 when it comes to fiscal policy taxes are a subsidiary issue the crucial long term fiscal problem facing the u s and its aging population is health care spending what happens to taxes will largely be shaped by changes in the health insurance market
6108222 i thought for the first time john mccain was revealing a lot of his personal side
6108223 you know he doesnt like to talk about when he was
6108224 is pauls gospel counterimperial evaluating the prospects of the fresh perspective fro evangelical theology
6108225 to what extent are teh parallels due merly to the fact that pal and the imepraci cult were drawing from the common stock of koine greek the lingua franca of the eastern part of the roman empire
6108226 an implication however differs in taht it is not a part of the autohrs conscious intention even though it is established by a type tha tderives from the authors willed meaning
6108227 the aims and agenda of the paul and politics group are broadly to problematize interrogate and re vision pauline texts and interpretations to idnetify oppresisvie formulaitlns as well as potnetially liberative visions and values
6108228 an improvement of over 8 percent in southern california is welcome news and hopefully the start of an upward trend
6108229 we established very good relations relatively speaking with china and suddenly you break the bridge it would have been easy just to be there
6108230 china daily acts often as a mouthpiece for the government and it also signals how the government feels about an issue
6108231 the fact that this runs on the front page suggests china is very unhappy
6108232 the article here points to the fact that stephen harper has not visited china since taking office in 2006
6108233 for china a major superpower that is a big slight and they continue to hammer down on this point
6108234 for me it was a good opportunity and maybe when i look back after a few years i will be proud of it not everybody can go on the cover of playboy i did it because i am confident of my body and myself it wasnt a group decision we havent seen each other the shooting was separate everyone decided it for themselves
6108235 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6108236 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6108237 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6108238 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6108239 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6108240 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6108241 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6108242 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6108243 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6108244 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6108245 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6108246 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6108247 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6108248 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6108249 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6108250 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6108251 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6108252 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6108253 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6108254 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6108255 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6108256 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6108257 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6108258 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6108259 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6108260 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6108261 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6108262 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6108263 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6108264 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6108265 our fundraising has been slow which kind of goes hand in hand for this time of year
6108266 im not surprised if were where we are by the end of september then i will be concerned
6108267 the question is reaching as many people as we can
6108268 its the legislators who will be deciding who the delegates are
6108269 they will be the ones who decide what questions get raised in the convention and if anything happens at all
6108270 the state constitution works and theres already a procedure in place to amend it without holding a taxpayer funded convention
6108271 i believe my last marriage turned me into an alcoholic i was so miserable and stayed in the relationship because of the kids but in the end it was awful for them because we were arguing six or seven years i hid the bottles when youre that depressed you cant even do it stop drinking for your kids thats the most disgusting thing
6108272 come on come on just say it you and me sitting in a tree k i s s i n g youre not in love with me
6108273 oh look i found it oh i really found it how could such a thing be happening to me
6108274 weve been together longer than most of our friends have but they dont know that its not always a party
6108275 and i dont know what id do if i found out you were untrue would i find it in my heart to forgive
6108276 next time ill hold my breath and count to ten
6108277 cant you see youre leaving me for an ugly girl does she talk about politics and all the stuff that used to make me sick
6108278 you were trying trying to tell me something i didnt want to know
6108279 get away while theres time your friends are making bets on your life
6108280 years have flown by taking with them time she never had for her own now she plays house while her husband stays out on the town
6108281 i think ive come to the conclusion that its all a bunch of bull love is an optical illusion and once again ive played the fool
6108282 well i love you mom and i love you daddy and i sure am glad that you had me but is it worth it over a stupid remote control
6108283 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6108284 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6108285 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6108286 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6108287 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6108288 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6108289 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6108290 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6108291 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6108292 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6108293 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6108294 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6108295 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6108296 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6108297 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6108298 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6108299 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6108300 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6108301 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6108302 this is a planning took where all things are going
6108303 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6108304 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6108305 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6108306 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6108307 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6108308 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6108309 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6108310 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6108311 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6108312 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6108313 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6108314 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6108315 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6108316 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6108317 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6108318 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6108319 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6108320 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6108321 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6108322 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6108323 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6108324 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6108325 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6108326 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6108327 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6108328 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6108329 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6108330 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6108331 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6108332 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6108333 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6108334 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6108335 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6108336 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6108337 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6108338 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6108339 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6108340 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6108341 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6108342 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6108343 being an orioles fan really paid off im as excited about the season tickets as i am about the 50 000 because it means ill be able to come to even more games
6108344 there was a lot of money on the table kurt really liked metallica but rose had the kind of macho rock persona that kurt detested
6108345 there was a recent piece that made me out to be this impossible person but i was having a really bad week and for a good reason
6108346 these programs are teaching viewers inaccurate views on medicine they are spreading misinformation
6108347 i may do it in the future but i dont think im going to do it right now
6108348 gm didnt call it pontiac g8 sport truck will have a v6
6108349 how to build your own custom full sized wireless guitar hero controller
6108350 hands on mac tools foose special edition tool box set
6108351 how to turn an old tractor seat into a great shop chair
6108352 i aint pro human because all humans aint pro black
6108353 sen mccain and i are colleagues in the us congress not confidantes he does not consult me and i do not consult him
6108354 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6108355 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6108356 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6108357 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6108358 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6108359 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6108360 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6108361 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6108362 someday therell be an n sync reunion but i dont think the time is right now maybe a few years down the road when we have gotten a chance to realise who we are as individuals well get back together as a group and put more music out
6108363 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6108364 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6108365 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6108366 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6108367 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6108368 already i have had people come up to me in cafes and say hey youre james franco right hey i cant get a hold of my guy do you know where i can buy some good weed
6108369 even in class at ucla ive had someone come up to me and be hey whats up man and give me a handshake and palm me a little bag of weed
6108370 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6108371 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6108372 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6108373 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6108374 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

6108393 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6108394 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6108395 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6108396 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6108397 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6108398 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6108399 im starting to feel more relaxed about acting in english now but it takes time and i have to work very hard on it
6108400 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6108401 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6108402 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6108403 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6108404 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6108405 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6108406 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6108407 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6108408 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6108409 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6108410 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6108411 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6108412 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6108413 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6108414 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6108415 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6108416 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything

6108441 guten morgen d rfte ich sie um ihre zimmernummer bitten
6108442 i am not a normal customer i am a smoker and you will not allow smoking in your restaurant
6108443 wouldnt it then be ok for me to take my plates outside and enjoy the smog from the cars
6108444 smoking is not not allowed inside and the breakfast is only served inside
6108445 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6108446 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6108447 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6108448 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6108449 i quite enjoy it actually im never followed but cate is her public identity is very associated with her work which i think is good right and proper because shes bloody good at it
6108450 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6108451 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6108452 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6108453 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6108454 to inspire the youth to live for jesus christ and offer the prime years of their lives to god and country
6108455 a dynamic youth movement transforming young people worldwide through the full gospel of jesus christ for righteous and excellent leadership in the church and nation
6108456 do you have your dancing shoes on so lets show hell what kind of generation we are
6108457 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6108458 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6108459 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6108460 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6108461 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6108462 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6108463 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6108464 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6108465 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6108466 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6108467 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6108468 do batteries with flat bottoms have more power than ones with dimples
6108469 do you have cameras that take pictures at the speed of light
6108470 i thought it was o k its an underwater camera right
6108471 it wont rust as long as it is in seawater will it
6108472 and dont let me catch you in my territory again
6108473 this was a shocking attack on a vulnerable woman who was walking home from the post office shortly before midday
6108474 we believe he targeted his victim following her from the post office to the alleyway
6108475 to attack a defenceless pensioner like this is pathetic however this man is clearly dangerous and needs to be caught
6108476 i must stress that this type of incident is extremely rare in this part of rochdale and i want to reassure residents particularly elderly people that we have a dedicated team of officers working on this
6108477 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6108478 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6108479 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6108480 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6108481 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6108482 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6108483 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6108484 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6108485 please dad take us to the kansas city irish fest we love it so
6108486 forget it theres no way im taking you to irish fest i know the ticket costs for me are reasonable if not downright cheap and that you guys being 12 and under get in free i know they have 257 different things for kids to do most of them free but i also know that you brats love nothing more than playing on those big inflatable bouncy things and the last time we went you dollar billed me to death a bounce here a buck a climb there a buck before you know it im so broke i cant afford to meet uncle bloggy at the pub so forget it
6108487 irish fest has made some significant changes in this particular area you can now purchase an all you can bounce bracelet for a mere 10 that lets us have unlimited use of the inflatable play structures all day long
6108488 we value the retail side at just 100m or 5 of turnover but we can see why management dont want to get rid of that for next to nothing and be left with all the debt even though they clearly see their future as more of a wholesaling publishing group
6108489 ambitious and much needed book which will be written from the worlds economic battlefields
6108490 it will provide an explanation of the current crisis and an authoritative guide to a new economic order one which will have to be heeded and adopted at a global level if were to make it to 2050 and beyond
6108491 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6108492 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6108493 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6108494 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6108495 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6108496 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

6108500 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6108501 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

6108524 over the last few weeks ive been talking a lot with the parents of malnourished children they tell me that for five or six months there was not a drop of rain hunger started to set in some of the farmers around here managed to grow a scant crop of ginger to sell to traders but theyve no food to eat the staples have become very expensive at the market compare the prices with last year 100kgs of maize for example has shot up from around 360 to 800 ethiopian birr 37 to 82 us the same with fertilizer it is simply too expensive for the farmers now that weve got some decent rainfall the maize and other crops are growing again but well have to wait until the next harvest in september or october before we see any sort of improvement
6108525 the patients in msfs care are just the tip of the iceberg
6108526 we are treating the most severely ill patients but many others are suffering from hunger they have exhausted their food stocks and right now they depend totally on food aid brought in from elsewhere food aid urgently needs to get through to these people so that they dont slip into acute malnutrition as well
6108527 an organization like msf has neither the capacity nor sufficient stocks of food aid to employ this strategy in all the affected areas
6108528 its very difficult to send children back home because theyre not malnourished enough when you can plainly see that they are hungry and that their whole family needs help
6108529 many are so desperate theyll do anything to receive a little food
6108530 we even have patients who speak the language of distant regions like wolayita or hadyia
6108531 these are areas where the humanitarian needs are comparable to here but where the amount of aid is clearly still insufficient
6108532 nick diaz is the no 1 contender k j noons should step up and be the champion that we think he is and take this fight nick diaz will take this fight any place anywhere noons management wont even return our calls hopefully k j wants the fight and hopefully he will instruct his management to take the fight k j signed a contract all we want is for him to honor that contract fight on oct 4 on cbs and prove that hes the champion we think he is right now hes not representing us as the elitexc champion

6108588 niameys privately owned media are being forced with increasing frequency to submit to decrees that are clearly being issued for purely political reasons
6108589 this is a disturbing development especially as the authorities no longer offer any clear explanation to the media they punish
6108590 the authorities can always brush aside our protests as coming from abroad but they cannot continue to hide behind respect for nigers sovereignty if they break their own rules

6108673 what sets this golf school apart from the rest is that they offer top notch instruction at reasonable rates
6108674 mels goal is to grow the game of golf game improvement equals player retention people shouldnt have to pay high prices for top quality instruction because high prices make learning the game and game improvement unaffordable for many middle income people so mel breaks down this barrier by offering a first class golf experience at a price most people can afford

6108676 golf magazine has consistently reported that the ritson sole golf school is one of the best values among americas top schools this special package delivers an even greater value at other top 25 schools students would pay three to four times as much partner that with our award winning jack nicklaus signature course and you have a golf package that truly lives up to its name

6108685 in a startling ominous decision ignored by most of the press around the country
6108686 able to say categorically that there is no evidence to indicate that mr arar has committed any offence or that his activities constitute a threat to the security of canada
6108687 the second circuit court of appeals announced yesterday it would convene at least 13 judges in december for another hearing for arar the ottawa engineer who was tortured and jailed in a syrian prison after being whisked out of jfk airport in september 2002 under a u
6108688 a three judge panel dismissed arars lawsuit in june but the dissenting judge said the ruling gave the u
6108689 yesterdays decision keeps alive the possibility that arar could still become the first rendition victim to force the bush administration to admit its role and compensate a victim in a case it maintains was an immigration matter
6108690 they have a green light to do to others what they did to arar
6108691 there can be little doubt that every official of the united states government involved in the torture of maher arar knew that sending him to syria was a clear violation of the u s constitution federal statutes and international law this is a dark day indeed
6108692 the prohibition on torture was so universally accepted that a u s court could hold responsible a paraguayan official charged with torturing a dissident in paraguay the u s court declared that when officials violate such a fundamental norm as torture they can be held accountable anywhere they are found
6108693 the torturer has become the pirate and slave trader before him an enemy of all mankind
6108694 such a ruling can have the most serious consequences to our foreign relations or national security or both
6108695 the coordinate branches of our government executive and legislative are those in whom the constitution imposes responsibility for our foreign affairs and national security those branches have the responsibility to determine whether judicial oversight is appropriate
6108696 one need not have much imagination to contemplate the negative effect on our relations with canada if discovery were to proceed in this case and were it to turn out that certain high canadian officials had despite public denials acquiesced in arars removal to syria
6108697 governments that do not wish to acknowledge publicly that they are assisting us would certainly hesitate to do so if our judicial discovery process could compromise them
6108698 judge trager said that even assuming the government had intended to remove maher arar to syria for torture the federal judiciary was in no position to hold our government officials liable for damages in the absence of explicit direction by congress
6108699 emphasis added if independent federal judges cannot hold our government accountable who can fortunately judge trager is not on the supreme court but look at whom george w bush has appointed to be our custodians of the constitution
6108700 rejected a request from american legislators that he appoint a special counsel to investigate the u s role in the case
6108701 three democrats sent a letter july 10 asking mukasey to appoint an outside special counsel to investigate and prosecute any violations of federal criminal laws
6108702 mukasey said u s officials received assurances from syria that arar would not be tortured sending him to canada could have posed a threat to our country mukasey said he said sending him to syria was safer
6108703 one reason officials refused to allow a man they suspected of al qaeda links to return home
6108704 there are still two investigations underway into the u s conduct in the arar case one in the department of homeland security and another in the justice departments office of professional responsibility
6108705 we believe it is important to take these broader preventative actions to respond to this situation promptly comprehensively and in the best interests of our consumers
6108706 we have a strong culture of food safety that these incidents do not uphold and we are taking every step required to maintain our very high standards

6108715 a large fraction of americans know that we need a jeffersonian political revolution to fix our corrupt system they were not fooled by the obama rhetoric about change not from someone that has been a product of and servant for the two party plutocracy yes all the votes for me and the other third party presidential candidates spelled the difference between obama winning and losing our voters correctly protested against the corrupt two party system they did not elect mccain only those who voted for mccain elected him and that is something they must live with as they watch a mccain administration continue dismantling american democracy and budget busting global warmongering
6108716 it is time to stop saying god bless america and begin repeating god save america the good news is that we will build even greater public support for a true political revolution during the mccain presidency all too often things must get much worse before they can get better they will get worse
6108717 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen

6108776 senator obama strongly supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose he believes that there is a moral and ethical element to this issue and he believes that women do not make these decisions casually but wrestle with them in consultation with their doctors pastors and family senator obama understands that some will disagree with him and choose not to support him and he respects those with different opinions but the recent attacks on senator obama that allege he would allow babies born alive to die are outrageous lies the suggestion that obama the proud father of two little girls and others who opposed these bills supported infanticide is deeply offensive and insulting there is no room for these kinds of distortions and lies in this campaign what senator obamas attackers dont tell you is that existing illinois law already requires doctors to provide medical care in the very rare case that babies are born alive during abortions

6108807 when she moved away from home arizona to study gymnastics in houston with famed coach bela karoly at age 13 we were devastated before we made the decision to let her go we went to houston to check this out

6108830 well uh bob the chinese are currently in first place so what that means for this next person is they will have to do even better
6108831 from the beginning of this investigation we opened our minds up to every possible scenario in this case so those detectives working on that task force have been contacted and are being kept abreast of whats going on in this investigation
6108832 we dont have a motive no suspects so we dont know the reason behind this
6108833 here is a man who grew up in a broken home whose father left at a young age and who was raised by a single mother
6108834 its an admirable story of rising from rags to riches one that resonates in many ways hes a modern horatio alger
6108835 now the mccain campaign wants to create a dramatically different narrative
6108836 they want you to see him as a man who went to fancy schools who has had the beneficiary of an elite life and is increasingly removed from the mainstream of normal american life
6108837 and now the mccain campaign wants to turn obamas strength into a weakness and make him seem like a celebrity who has nothing to offer but high blown words
6108838 hes obviously not in the same league as britney spears or paris hilton theyve gone way too far with that but weve seen where strategies that have been derided by commentators have been effective with voters
6108839 weve learned from previous campaigns that the effective way to create an alternative story for your rival is the summer before the fall campaign
6108840 you can but a ball and chain on an opponent and hes going to have a hard time running a race in the fall
6108841 but hes not an elitist thats not a sustained campaign tactic here was someone who grew up with nothing verses the son of four star admirals its a nice try and a good diversion in the first part of august but painting him as an elitist is not a winning strategy going into the fall
6108842 dont forget your safe word and you will be fine

6108874 jadi surat perpanjangan penahanannya dari hakim dia akan tetap ditahan sampai 10 september untuk proses di pengadilan
6108875 ini artinya habib 12 jam ditahan tanpa surat berdasarkan pasal 25 ayat 3 kuhp bila masa penahanan seorang tersangka habis atau tidak diperpanjang maka dia harus bebas ini juga berarti polda metro jaya telah merampas kemerdekaan habib rizieq
6108876 jadi sebenarnya yang berhak bebas bukan hanya habib tapi juga munarman keduanya ditahan 20 hari sejak 31 juli dan berakhir pada 19 agustus tapi polda tetap menahannya meski tidak ada surat perpanjangan penahanannya
6108877 bahkan permohonan pun baru diurus saya tidak habis pikir untuk munarman matsuni kaloko dan 7 laskar fpi lainnya yang tetap ditahan tanpa ada kepastian hukum surat perpanjangan penahannya belum ada tapi polda metro jaya tetap tidak mau membebaskan mereka seharusnya mereka sudah bebas demi hukum

6108886 he has been working on his start and the first part of the 100 proved he has worked on that
6108887 hes going to have to turn the corner a lot better and run the corner better to break the 200m record
6108888 that affords him the ability to cover more ground with every stride the way no one else can
6108889 it must be hard for john mccain running on the failed ideas of his best friend george w bush which is why hes trying to distract americans from the truth about his own failed policies the truth is that barack obama knows how hard it is for the middle class since he worked his way up after being on food stamps as a child and thats why hes giving them a tax break of 1000 which is three times more than john mccains measly 319 tax break but since john mccain thinks being rich starts at earning 5 million a year no wonder why hes so out of touch hed rather give billions in tax breaks away to his rich buddies who couldnt care less about the economic pain of hardworking americans barack obama has a healthcare plan to reduce costs and cover the uninsured john mccain leave them out in the cold barack obama has new ideas to re invigorate our economy while john mccain doesnt have one new idea to offer on the economy hes said himself he doesnt have a clue to deal with the economy cutting taxes for the rich and ignoring the middle class that sounds familiar and its the same old song that weve had for the past eight years mccain sure likes singing that song

6108926 we are having good success in eradication efforts through the arizona pink bollworm eradication program each cotton growing area is at some phase of eradication
6108927 the long term goal is to protect and maintain the viability of arizonas cotton industry
6108928 there is a 99 8 percent reduction in native pinkies in area 1 since the program was launched
6108929 the reduction figures are impressive but finding the last few natives is often the hardest part of any eradication program
6108930 capture numbers down to 200 natives means were making good progress but remember our goal is the last man standing
6108931 results show a near 99 percent reduction in pink bollworms in area 2
6108932 bt cotton produces almost 100 percent control of the pink bollworm
6108933 bt is the most powerful tool ever developed for pinkie control when coupled with other components in the eradication program
6108934 the area is unique since its bi national the u s and mexico
6108935 the mexican government has put in eradication dollars and so have the growers its a good marriage of efforts between the two countries in addressing pink bollworm eradication
6108936 we will establish a system where functional eradication could be announced
6108937 full eradication could be declared a year after the eradication activities are ended final decisions must be biologically based

6108944 not only will we be gathering final data on 2008 small grains production but well also be collecting information on quantities of grains and oilseeds stored on farms statewide
6108945 especially in times as uncertain as these such data is widely anticipated not only by farmers but by their customers international trading partners policymakers and many others
6108946 nass safeguards the privacy of all responses and publishes only state and national level data ensuring that no individual operation or producer can be identified

6108972 people and i use the term loosely since i mean republicans have questioned my patriotism for months
6108973 they accused me of not loving my country because i wouldnt wear an american flag lapel pin truth is i didnt wear it for the same reason john mccain doesnt wear a mitt romney lapel pin i didnt want to give away my choice for vice president
6108974 the american flag and i enjoy a close personal relationship
6108975 very casual very comfortable neither one of us feels compelled to make phony hand over heart gestures in each others presence its a relationship where the mutual love and respect is just so well understood that it never needs to be spoken of in public
6108976 its no secret that barack obama has no military experience on this issue an american flag brings much needed balance to the ticket having proudly served overseas in every war this country has fought however like obama its also very experienced at saying nothing intelligent while waving at crowds of foreigners
6108977 were looking forward to meeting students to talk about google apps and hear how theyre usi

6108986 this is an opportunity ive wanted since i started wrestling at 5 25 years ago and its pretty sour to have on me

6108988 i think they are going to be the olympic champions for sure
6108989 i picked up on your blog piece on golden cross acoustic
6108990 we work on the principle of mutual aid and devote our time to actively promoting an alternative to the big business of the music industry
6108991 paul starr has this uncanny ability to look at a face and see what it needs hes done my face a thousand times and never repeated a look i have never felt more like the best version of myself than when paul has made me up
6108992 who are you and what have you done with the real bill clinton
6108993 your evil spawn angelina jolie and her vacuous hubby brad pitt make about 40 million a year in violent psychopathic movies and give away three of it to starving children trying to look as if they give a crap about humanity as they spit out more dunces that will consume more than their fair share and wreck the earth even more
6108994 miss jolie says she likes john mccain too and hasnt decided who to endorse huh arent you supposed to be somewhat enlightened or do you not know that the african daughter you hold in every picture had parents who suffered and died because of the republican partys worldwide economic assault on africa over the last few decades since reagan
6108995 a major auction of works by damien hirst that will include an important series of new pieces which have been created over the past two years including monumental formaldehyde sculptures paintings which expand on the artists classic themes such as butterflies cancer cells and pills exquisite new cabinets and insightful preparatory drawings
6108996 not right now but hopefully within the next 50 years
6108997 i might be speaking against something that god is actually doing
6108998 no human ever filled a vessel worse than the stomach
6108999 no human ever filled a vessel worse than the stomach sufficient for any son of aadam are some morsels to keep his back straight but if it must be then one third for his food one third for his drink and one third for his breath
6109000 if the people only used these words they would avoid all diseases and maladies and the clinics and pharmacies would be idle
6109001 that which has killed mankind is the introduction of food on top of food before it has been digested
6109002 o son of adam eat with one third of your stomach and drink with one third and leave one third of your stomach to breathe so that you may think
6109003 something which aids in digesting your food after you eat
6109004 i have not eaten to being full for four months that is not because i am not able to do so but i was with a group of people who were hungry more than they were full
6109005 whoever eats little will understand and make others understand and will be clear and humble
6109006 the test of aadam alayhis salaam was food and it is your test until qiyama
6109007 whoever takes control of his stomach gets control of all good deeds
6109008 i have eaten until i am no longer able to eat
6109009 subhaanallaah does a muslim eat until he is no longer able to eat
6109010 i have not filled myself in sixteen years because filling oneself makes the body heavy removes clear understanding induces sleep and makes one weak for worship
6109011 the believer eats with one stomach while the kafir eats with seven stomachs
6109012 food for one is enough for two and food for two is enough for three and food for three is enough for four
6109013 the family of muhammad sal allaahu alayhe wa sallam never filled themselves with wheat bread three days in a row from the time he came to madeenah until he passed away
6109014 then they were followed by generations who neglected the prayer and followed their appetites
6109015 the best generation is my generation followed by the one after them then the one after them then will come a people who bear witness but are not asked to bear witness who swear oaths but do not fulfill them and fatness will appear among them
6109016 my greatest fear for you is the appetites of transgression with regard to your stomachs and your privates and the inclinations which lead astray

6109050 enterprises are increasingly being asked to prove their green credentials or risk finding themselves at the bottom of accredited suppliers lists
6109051 we believe that companies who put in place a sustainable development programme now will find themselves expanding at a greater rate in the future compared to competitors who have ignored these issues
6109052 sustainability is an issue that affects everyone in the supply chain
6109053 companies might be aware of the direct environmental impact of their operations but unless they procure from companies who are also addressing these issues and that includes factors like transportation of materials then in the future their order books will undoubtedly suffer as we and the world become more green conscious

6109055 you talk to some of the big league hitters in this league and they know
6109056 i was talking to dustan mohr and he said its filthy
6109057 im not sure weve seen the top end of the radar gun on this kid yet there are a lot of things hes going to do hes going to mature physically and mentally he doesnt have arm problems and hes as strong as a horse
6109058 someone needs to tell him how to warm up as a relief pitcher
6109059 hes still in that learning phase when you tell him to start getting loose a couple of minutes later hes throwing peas in the bullpen the great ones understand that they finish their warmup on the mound he doesnt have the experience to understand those things
6109060 coming in from college he had been a short guy there we mistakenly put the kid in that role here
6109061 the kid grew into a man in those first three to four starts
6109062 you put a little pressure on him and then back off but you dont break their spirit
6109063 i think long term hell be a big league starter i hope they will fast track him he needs that entertainment and that challenge he needs to have a lot of things going on at once part of his problem is you have to keep the kid active its hard for him to focus on one thing but hes a talented young man if he stays on the straight and narrow hes a kid well talk about when he makes his first start in the big leagues
6109064 he throws two different ones one is for strikes and the other is for the strikeout its kind of like a trevor hoffman change but then if he threw in the mid 90s like trevor used to hed be in the big leagues
6109065 he had good numbers he has long arms and a nice smooth delivery
6109066 his arm action is a little low on the backside but somehow he got the gift to make that changeup work for him
6109067 he has good run on the ball when he locates down
6109068 but he can also elevate in the zone and then he has that breaking ball dropping from top to bottom he works both sides of the plate
6109069 hes the kind of kid who just wants to pitch whatever the role is
6109070 i dont know if its from settling into the rotation but hes started to get into that grove of letting his stuff be
6109071 he used to pitch from the stretch all the time now hes developed his windup and the ball is jumping out of his hand
6109072 heres what i dont understand if you watch him play youd never know that
6109073 its never been a barrier to how well he performs thats a frustrating part from the standpoint of a coach who wants to see him move on

6109108 un 20 por ciento de la reuni n se relacion con la situaci n del partido en la provincia luego de la lista de unidad que se hizo encabezada por el reutemanista ricardo spinozzi previa declinaci n del candidato kirchnerista agust n rossi y que asumieran las autoridades comenz una nueva etapa le d mi punto de vista yo no integro el consejo partidario en el sentido de que el pj se debe recomponer pensando en el futuro ser necesario armonizar posiciones internas reconstruir la acci n partidaria y darle para adelante
6109109 no hubo ninguna ruptura partidaria sino una posici n diferente respecto de las retenciones que siempre hice p blica y respecto de la cual no pod a haber sorpresas
6109110 la mayor parte de la reuni n estuvo orientada a decirle lo que pasaba con el campo no se ha solucionada nada ninguno de los problemas que se observan en las distintas producciones y su comercializaci n que el secretario de agricultura de la naci n carlos cheppi se re na en las pr ximas horas con las mesas de la producci n lechera y de la industria y que desde el oncca se haga lo mismo con los sectores c rnicos no quiere decir que haya soluciones una cosa es hacer reuniones y otra aportar soluciones esto qued claro

6109115 washington reuters in a sharp turnaround republican john mccain has opened a 5 point lead on democrat barack obama in the u s presidential race and is seen as a stronger manager of the economy according to a reuters zogby poll released on wednesday mccain leads obama among likely u s voters by 46 percent to 41 percent wiping out obamas solid 7 point advantage in july and taking his first lead in the monthly reuters zogby poll the reversal follows a month of attacks by mccain who has questioned obamas experience criticized his opposition to most new offshore oil drilling and mocked his overseas trip the poll was taken thursday through saturday as obama wrapped up a weeklong vacation in hawaii that ceded the political spotlight to mccain who seized on russias invasion of georgia to emphasize his foreign policy views

6109120 a combative barack obama said tuesday that republican john mccain doesnt know what hes up against in this election and challenged his rival to stop questioning his character and patriotism obama campaigning in a state where he hopes to become the first democratic presidential candidate to win in more than three decades implored his supporters to fight for the presidency our job in this election is not just win although im a big believer in winning obama said during the rally i dont intend to lose this election john mccain doesnt know what hes up against he can talk all he wants about britney spears and paris hilton but i dont have time for that mess obama said his remarks carried forward a theme of feisty campaigning he debuted earlier in the day
6109121 over the past few years we have invested heavily in logistics it and systems and people which is now enabling vds to secure increasing market share
6109122 this time comments came in from key stakeholders particularly government and the review panel that required some additional work on the documentation the draft eir to provide better justification of certain things and better descriptions of some of the results of the studies
6109123 it was agreed that the risk of not meeting the deadline of the first public meeting was too great and it was thought prudent to postpone the meetings
6109124 we recognised however that we needed to do something about the nuisance impact that the wastewater was having on kitesurfers
6109125 the mccain campaign believes that some of hillary clintons tactics especially questioning whether obama is ready to lead can be a real winner
6109126 the mccain team has been very open that they went to school on the hillary clinton campaign that they learned from that
6109127 and on this 3 a m ad whats very striking as some have pointed out over the last few days is that barack obama was winning a steady streak of victories against hillary clinton
6109128 and then she ran that ad and she really went on the attack on the experience question and she won the bulk of the primaries thereafter in the closing months of the democratic primaries and won 500 000 more votes than he did and almost took it away from him
6109129 which candidate do voters believe is better qualified to deal with russia mccain by better than 2 1
6109130 going after more centrist voters more swing voters more conservative voters who will be a much bigger deal in the general election than they were in those primaries and caucuses
6109131 not only did the clinton campaign give mccain and his advisers a road map but they actually started the mccains down that path
6109132 thats why youre hearing from obama very specific policy oriented proposals here
6109133 theres not a lot of that kind of flash if you will from the earlier days
6109134 the big question now is whether obama can successfully regain control of the campaign agenda as we head into the democratic convention
6109135 what the clinton campaign demonstrated is when you bring obama back down to earth its a better battle
6109136 we need to learn to address the challenging 21st century issues in this socially networked world privacy drm rights legal issues ownership safety etc we need to understand the issues related to our photos are they real b amp w colour professional edgy silly embarrassing whatever will we want them to turn up in other contexts what about our private lives and photos what about weird uncle bill either way its time to re find our voice as professionals anonymity just isnt working for us professionalism requires that we learn to how to present ourselves promote ourselves and be where our market of users can discover us and be impressed that we are the sharks in the tank of the emerging information and knowledge economy our reputation will play out in the social web space as much as anywhere else we need to get good at this

6109140 it just means were starting to do things in the right way
6109141 were making less mistakes were starting to believe in what were doing it just validates the work that weve done its good but still theres a long ways to go its just nice to be there right now
6109142 i dont think weve played particularly bad in any of these games but tonight was one bad inning
6109143 we set the table for them and cracked it open further with an error and those guys capped it off with a hit we just didnt get it done late weve been doing a terrific job of that but not tonight
6109144 weve been pitching well its just at the end we cracked the door for them and let them win
6109145 its frustrating because we didnt play well enough certainly in the eighth inning theres not much more you can say about it
6109146 nick diaz is the no 1 contender k j noons should step up and be the champion that we think he is and take this fight nick diaz will take this fight any place anywhere noons management wont even return our calls
6109147 i dont understand it this fight on cbs is maximum exposure and the opportunity for maximum sponsorship dollars way more than he could make on showtime at this point i question his management
6109148 hopefully k j wants the fight and hopefully he will instruct his management to take the fight k j signed a contract all we want is for him to honor that contract fight on oct 4 on cbs and prove that hes the champion we think he is right now hes not representing us as the elitexc champion
6109149 its not the kind of thing that we in our wildest dreams would expect to happen in our hospitals in our wildest nightmares i guess
6109150 and sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really upset you know into wallowing in self pity sometimes and i think its all part of the healing

6109165 when i was twelve years old my brother charlie was murdered by a man named frank fuhrmann i lost my virginity to a 20 year old man and i was ordained with the priesthood in the church of jesus christ of latter day saints my graduate thesis film for the california institute of the arts is an autobiographical documentary that explores these events and their aftermath the film will share with others my unique journey into manhood and i hope resonate with audiences living in an era of continuous cycles of violence meadowlark will comprise volumes of family photos newspaper articles and legal documents regarding my brothers death and 16mm film shot in various locations in montana and at my moms home in new mexico i am talking with people involved in my brothers homicide case and subsequent trial families that now inhabit homes where i used to live my own family and i am eventually speaking to the man responsible for my brothers death this is a very personal endeavor at times the subject material is difficult and painful to engage but i am guided by a belief that confronting and talking about the horrible events that we experience is a way to help all of us understand those events more profoundly the breathtaking landscapes of my youth keep a multitude of secrets meadowlark exposes them my hope is that an audience will see this film and leave the theater feeling as though they were invited into an intimate personal story a story that is remarkable but not altogether foreign to the social landscape of america

6109407 both marc and i were somewhat disappointed that all her focus was on the tryon residents and not on the staff
6109408 i think she wants to do away with these tryon types of facilities and put them out in the community
6109409 we kind of got the impression theyre ocfs going to downsize it
6109410 my first thought is that while im sympathetic its not less dangerous to the staff
6109411 as you know the system utilized a corrections based model that relied on excessive use of restraints to control children suffering from post traumatic stress conduct or anxiety disorders depression and developmental disorders
6109412 as a result of this corrections based system children in ocfs custody are not getting better instead after release 80 percent of them were getting arrested again within three years
6109413 children aged 10 to 18 cannot be treated like adults
6109414 the scientific research has firmly established that their brains are still developing with proper diagnoses these children can be treated and rehabilitated so that they can reach their full potential as adults
6109415 the agency has aggressively been reducing the number of restraints used on children which are counterproductive and often result in children and staff getting hurt
6109416 as you are both well aware a child at tryon residential center died following a restraint in november 2006 the current rate of injuries to children and staff from restraints is unacceptable
6109417 for some at tryon reform has been a challenge and they are pushing back
6109418 it pains me to read some of the negative comments these employees have posted on the web site of a local fulton county newspaper
6109419 theyve written that the children in ocfs custody are hateful and evil and should be restrained with pepper spray and put to work in chain gangs
6109420 clearly ocfs needs to continue to expand and enhance its intensive training program in trauma informed therapies that are proven to work
6109421 the agency will also reinforce dialectic behavior therapy which helps children who are struggling to manage their emotions provide mental health training for non clinical staff and offer refresher courses in sanctuary trauma informed intervention
6109422 we were kind of upset with her relationship with the local media

6109429 effective revenue management strategy backed up by a solid system forces a management process that prevents over correcting in leaner times it has helped us in boom times too when managers might have been content with good occupancy and perhaps were slow to push rents higher
6109430 the b product is still a fairly safe place to be even though were seeing rent growth flatten in some markets
6109431 we are carefully watching all our markets continuing to do acquisitions and working to maximize occupancy and maximize revenue
6109432 an important value of using lease rent optimization technology is that it requires we track competitors and watch our renewals more carefully so we can generate daily rents more in tune with our markets it also stabilizes our renewal pace
6109433 people mistakenly believe that when you implement a revenue management system you flip a few switches and everyone turns off their brains
6109434 laramars pricing optimization system requires that our entire team be more engaged with the market and our strategies on a daily basis

6109440 other than both are usually played by a group of guys in hockey rinks who travel around a lot
6109441 when the stars came to dallas i ran into craig ludwig we started talking and i told him how much id really like to go to a game
6109442 he hooked me up with seats the very next night to the next game and i was just floored

6109444 the band members must have it with their crews just as the players and their coaches
6109445 music requires the teamwork of the guys in the band and like hockey everybodys got to be coordinated so it requires a lot of practice and a certain state of mind to be able to keep yourself up when perhaps you really dont feel like doing so
6109446 camaraderie is big the band members must have it with their crews just as the players and their coaches
6109447 i guess the word that comes to mind is intensity
6109448 these guys when youre around them theyre intense at their job hockey players are the same its all they know theyve been doing it since they were kids their intensity and their drive theyve wanted to do all their lives
6109449 the sheer brutality the speed the game is just so intense and thats what hard rock is all about the intensity pushing that level up further and further
6109450 most teams obviously prefer to play at home because they have the crowd on their side i guess theres a slight difference because in rock and roll heavy metal there is no home team in every hockey rink we get a home crowd
6109451 as a player youre sitting there and it just seems to fit
6109452 you want to and you need to hear it loud especially when theres not a lot of life in the building thats when guys start tapping their legs and hitting each other
6109453 for some reason at least with the guys ive been around weve always said that rock stars want to be hockey players and the hockey players want to be rock stars

6109530 its almost like an arms war at one point in time a good old fashioned fist fight may have been the way differences were sorted out
6109531 the increase in violence goes hand in hand with the need to arm oneself to have the advantage if you want to have the upper hand you go with the biggest gun guns are in the hands of young people and thats because they are actively seeking them
6109532 all kinds of crime is going on but it only becomes officially crime when police charge someone
6109533 it does depend upon the focus of police with weapons charges it might relate to a concentrated focus of police activity
6109534 instead what were seeing is a steady trend line up
6109535 what weve done is moved the crime up along various highways out of the gta and weve moved it into some of these communities where theyve never heard of anybody being arrested with a gun now its routine its had a devastating impact

6109782 la misma congelaci n de embriones aunque se realice para mantener en vida al embri n crioconservaci n constituye una ofensa al respeto debido a los seres humanos por cuanto les expone a graves riesgos de muerte o de da o a la integridad f sica les priva al menos temporalmente de la acogida y de la gestaci n materna y les pone en una situaci n susceptible de nuevas lesiones y manipulaciones
6109783 algunos intentos de intervenir sobre el patrimonio cromos mico y gen tico no son terap uticos sino que miran a la producci n de seres humanos seleccionados en cuanto al sexo o a otras cualidades prefijadas estas manipulaciones son contrarias a la dignidad personal del ser humano a su integridad y a su identidad no pueden justificarse de modo alguno a causa de posibles consecuencias beneficiosas para la humanidad futura cada persona merece respeto por s misma en esto consiste la dignidad y el derecho del ser humano desde su inicio

6109785 actualmente algunos cient ficos y pol ticos est n tratando de establecer una distinci n entre la clonaci n reproductiva y la clonaci n terap utica
6109786 la distinci n entre estos dos tipos de clonaci n es una distinci n biot cnica pero no moral
6109787 la gran mayor a de la gente se opone a la clonaci n reproductiva ya que es tan repulsiva pues le niega al ni o un padre y convierte a la madre en su hermana gemela sin embargo algunas personas est n cayendo en la trampa de pensar que la clonaci n terap utica s es buena porque ayudar a a curar enfermedades pero el error de este argumento reside en que el embri n humano es destruido para obtener sus c lulas madres nunca se debe permitir la matanza de seres humanos inocentes a n cuando fuera por una noble causa como la de tratar de curar graves enfermedades
6109788 afortunadamente dios nos ha provisto de alternativas a la clonaci n humana y a la investigaci n de c lulas madres embrionarias las c lulas madres que se obtienen de tejidos adultos e incluso del cord n umbilical o de la placenta tienen el potencial de suministrar tejido nuevo para el uso terap utico sin la destrucci n de vida humana la iglesia cat lica no se opone a este tipo de investigaci n siempre y cuando se haya obtenido el consentimiento apropiado

6109813 i would be extremely delighted if shevchenko returns to milan and i am ready to embrace the ukraine champion again for us its about a return home
6109814 the opposition are keeping quiet now because they are terrified of doing moscows work
6109815 but as soon as the russians are out of the country saakashvili is finished
6109816 mr miliband said it was a wise decision of the opposition not to raise problems during the occupation but he also said that he understood that it would soon be time for normal political life to return
6109817 saakashvili bears part of the responsibility for this war russia was trying to provoke us but we should have avoided direct military confrontation
6109818 im afraid it will not be very easy for the government to answer all the questions

6109839 but their minds were made dull for to this day the same veil remains when the old covenant is read it has not been removed because only in christ is it taken away
6109840 this sort of behaviour it is putting entire regions along the murray darling basin on their knees
6109841 but at the moment for the people who are up the top of the basin it is first in best dressed showing no concern for anyone down lower it is un australian
6109842 we are going to be running out of water in the next few weeks there will be water for critical human needs and that is it everyone is starting to get very anxious
6109843 we know river systems dont respect state borders surely in the middle of one of the worst droughts in our history we can get our institutional structure in place to recognise that reality
6109844 the desperate need to accelerate the purchase of environmental water so we can secure the health of those river systems
6109845 we have also committed to working with state governments to co fund the purchase of appropriately located irrigation properties and their water entitlements to enhance environmental outcomes in the northern basin
6109846 public storage facilities had enjoyed inflow and rivers have run at their best for several years providing extended opportunity to harvest water
6109847 which demonstrates the highly variable way that streams can run in queensland
6109848 breaks out into floodplains or alternatively feeds into terminal wetlands resulting in a great loss of this water
6109849 this means that the scope for substantial volume to flow through to the murray is very limited
6109850 we need to implement an interim basin plan within months so that we can start managing this system given the circumstances we currently find ourselves in
6109851 the river systems and the agricultural systems are collapsing and our institutional response needs to match that reality that nature has imposed on us
6109852 we are not really pointing the finger at the irrigators up there you do what you are allowed to do
6109853 water is a shared responsibility if the states cant handle it and cant agree it has got to move to federal control
6109854 we probably did take a fair bit of water in queensland this year simply because the river ran for a long period of time
6109855 towns almost died up here everybody just stopped spending money
6109856 most farms let most of their staff go seven dry years it was past anything anyone could ever believe
6109857 a lot of sorghum and sunflowers and soybeans there is a bit of wheat in now
6109858 it has got some cash flow going and it has got the towns going again
6109859 which of the existing supreme court justices would you not have appointed
6109860 how stupid does australia look when we are flying people in from overseas to do these jobs
6109861 how can we have an entire industry out there under threat because we cant get people to work here
6109862 theres not enough encouragement in the system to get people off the dole and into these jobs
6109863 there has to be tougher rules because indigenous people just arent taking up the jobs if youre not prepared to put your hand up for a job no matter where it is we shouldnt have to continue paying the dole the vast majority of indigenous people need to work and are ready to work
6109864 it would be a tragedy if it had to be farmed out to other nations
6109865 i think it is because at a time when entry level work is shrinking these are areas where our people can show they can enter
6109866 the most difficult end of the labour market young indigenous people with no skills
6109867 the bottom line from our end is you cannot force people to work
6109868 all the attempts we have made in getting indigenous workers involved have failed the best form of aid for anyone is employment and opportunity
6109869 if we can give people work its a win win situation but they just wont take the work
6109870 how can we have 22 000 low skill jobs go begging when we have so many indigenous people who are unemployed
6109871 unemployment benefits should be suspended in places like mildura during the picking season if jobs cant be filled
6109872 its not entirely realistic to force people to move vast distances
6109873 but if unskilled work is readily available in a particular area unemployment benefits should no longer be available
6109874 dont we have our first priority and responsibility to australians particularly those who havent got work
6109875 no way stop indigenous australians from getting a job as a seasonal worker
6109876 overseas low skilled seasonal workers will be employed only after employers have demonstrated they have first made reasonable efforts to employ australians
6109877 it was probably something i went into as a result of people i met in vegas lets put it that way
6109878 i bought the quarry as an investment and its done nothing at all and all of a sudden out of the blue ive had an offer to start it up and get it going as a business so im going over to run that
6109879 one of the most elegant and impressive homes on the whitsunday mainland
6109880 i love it to bits its a shame to be leaving it really but weve got to do what weve got to do
6109881 it would be nice to think i could but i am pretty much asking what it cost me and what i put into the place
6109882 for 10 years we used to base ourselves in england for the polo and we flew all around france and germany and wherever
6109883 in its struggle against terrorism france has just been hard hit
6109884 my determination is intact france is committed to pursuing the struggle against terrorism for democracy and for freedom
6109885 this is a just cause it is an honour for france and for its army to defend it
6109886 serious measures notably in the air were taken to support and extricate our men caught in an extremely violent ambush
6109887 the doctor prescribed a painkiller and issued a certificate saying he is fit to travel
6109888 we will have to repatriate him back to vietnam because he is on our watch list as persona non grata thai immigration cannot let him enter
6109889 the issues are similar to the defence force just because you dont have a war doesnt mean you disband the army navy and air force
6109890 our darwin office closed six months ago and now we are losing all the rest it is difficult to see how we can possibly service remote areas such as queensland and the northern territory with the remaining staff
6109891 there used to be 10 technical staff in brisbane to look after southeast queensland now we have four and we have to cover all the areas handled by the closed offices
6109892 on top of that acma receives more than 8 million from the government to do digital television field strength measurements all over australia prior to the analogue switch off in 2013
6109893 this is to establish just what the problems are going to be and believe me there are some real problems
6109894 so far we have done about 1200 but they may have to be done again because there has been a rethink and there may have been a blunder in getting us to do the measurement at 2 5m antenna height instead of a more realistic height as found at most homes
6109895 unless this work is completed in time for translators and fill in transmitters to be installed there is a real risk that many thousands of people will be watching blank screens when analogue switches off
6109896 we have another team using new equipment replicating the tests done at 2 5m and the results they have been getting from their tests at a height of 10m show substantially the same results as the earlier readings
6109897 these cuts highlight the damage short sighted arbitrary efficiency dividend cuts can have
6109898 there are always unintended consequences and it appears in this instance that they may be very costly we are urging acma and the government to revisit this issue
6109899 should the merger not eventuate or not be completed in the timeframe envisaged moodys has stated that there would be potential for downward pressure on our deposit and debt ratings
6109900 since then we have been able to demonstrate clearly that we have ongoing access to wholesale term funding and we have reduced our short term wholesale debt
6109901 we have raised this years term funding and 30 per cent of next years funding
6109902 red herring interesting with a lot of emotion around it that suits some parties
6109903 accordingly in 2008 we have held a higher level of liquid assets and increased our proportion of wholesale funding

6109917 im playing the best golf i have ever played since learning natural golf i play a rigorous tourney circuit with other nfl alumni and hall of famers and they are amazed every day i recount for an athletic colleague how i switched to the natural single plane swing method and what an amazing difference it has made in my overall performance
6109918 joe is in incredible shape and is famous for never missing a game due to injury in his entire football career joes golf challenge started with body rotation of the conventional swing hes got large arms and a barrel chest but hes also got incredible athletic acumen and got the mental part of the fundamental change to the natural single plane swing immediately he took a 4 day school with platinum level natural golf instructor steve conrad charleston sc and chased it with lessons from platinum level instructors in charlotte nc eric hanson and buffalo ny jim lahey while traveling on his tourney circuit and is now the envy of a slew of players he sees regularly
6109919 as a 4 handicap looking to be a scratch golfer i see that natural golf and the single plane swing method is the key to helping me get my golf game where i want it to be my one day school with pga professional and ngci dutch van ooestendorp tunica ms was impressive im playing the hank aaron and walter payton tournaments this month and im excited to apply what ive learned into my game and show others what this swing method could do for them
6109920 its no secret that the more high exposure sports figures playing golf using the natural single plane swing method the more likely that golfers novice to experienced will realize that the natural single plane swing method is the easiest way to enjoy the game of golf
6109921 with professional athletes agreeing that its the natural single plane swing that gives them the advantage of a better game its just intuitive that the general player would find the same ease in the method with our corporate mission being to grow the game i think its the most effective way to make a difference and guarantee the future of golf

6109928 barack obama seems to have gotten the message about his message in the past few days amid growing concerns among democratic allies obama has begun campaigning in a different gear one that is more aggressive in attacking john mccain and more focused on the economic concerns of struggling americans
6109929 for the second day in a row barack obama has demonstrated a change in attitude
6109930 at a town hall meeting today he was fiercer his attacks on john mccain were sharper and he seemed to be as he likes to say fired up

6109943 my husbands sister was burnt alive ossetian fighters made her set her own house on fire then they pushed her in there and locked the door behind her
6109944 i phoned my ossetian neighbours asking them to bury my husband they said they had tried but the fighters threatened to kill anyone who would try to bury a georgian ive been haunted by nightmares i cant carry on living
6109945 my village took the hardest hit they bombed and fired at it from all sides in the morning after the attack on our village stopped we got out of our cellar and fled
6109946 she had to leave her old father behind she doesnt know what happened to him the village was destroyed and plundered and lots of its residents were killed
6109947 if youd met my father you would know that he was an absolutely harmless person he did not deserve a death like that
6109948 and he cried so much when i was leaving how can i ever forget his eyes
6109949 today i was told that they were killed but the person who told me this does not know them personally he isnt certain its not reliable information its a rumour i dont believe it i dont want to believe it i will go on looking for them
