8300080 moi autant de commentaires crit si rapidement et lexicalement exprim de la m me mani re je trouve a louche
8300081 eric francis tu aurais fait quoi toi si tu tais un policier intimid par un groupe agressif que tu tentais de proc der une arrestation et quun des jeunes voyous se lan aient sur toi et semblaient vouloir sortir quelque chose de ses poches
8300082 cest vraiment symptomatique dune certaine jeunesse louche cette peur de la police quand tu nas rien te reprocher quand tu marches droit la police nest pas ton ennemie mais ton alli e
8300083 toi si tu voyais ton fr re ou ta soeur se faire arreter et maltraiter pour rien tu le laisserais faire caca
8300084 quun homme adulte de 18 ans fon ant sur une polici re ne m rite pas son sort si triste fut il
8300085 je trouve la version de la police infiniment plus cr dible que celle du fr re de freddy qui est en probation pour des d lits mineurs mais sil sav rait que les policiers ont effectivement tir sur le jeune homme sans raison valable je serai le premier exiger des suspensions voire un cong diement pour ceux ci et les d noncer prement et je serais alors lalli le plus fid le de tous ceux qui me d noncent aujourdhui bonne nuit
8300086 au contraire cest des cacausians blancs qui nous ont pris de notre homeland pour venir ici ok ma chere alors cest pas de notre faute si on est dans ton quebec ok
8300087 mais cest quoi ce d lire ils crivent tous de la m me fa on en lettre capitale sans paragraphe sans ponctuation avec le m me vocabulaire vraiment moins davoir affaire une g n ration danalphab te maitrisant parfaitement la recherche de blog sur google il y a quelque chose qui cloche ici moi je pense quil y a un seul esprit malade derri re ce d lire et le pire est que dans un cas comme dans lautre je ne peux pas croire autant de commentaires en si peu de temps
8300088 ah nous sommes mieux queux nous avons une belle civilisation notre gouvernement est solide et nos policiers sont sans failles
8300089 2 la version actuelle et la seule publi e en ce moment mentionne que les policiers ont senti une menace due a la violence verbale du groupe ainsi quun geste soudain de sortir rapidement les mains de ses poches en sapprochant du policier et en protestant et en voyant un collegue pris a la gorge etc un policier pris a la gorge son autre collegue entoure de 20 personnes un gars arrive brusquement et sors ses mains de ses poches pour arriver a lautre en protestant et la boom une r action tr s surprenante a mon avis quand meme dans le sens quil faut d gainer charger et tirer a son ce quon sache aussi les coups de feu sont parti en direction des 3 qui agressaient le policier ou sen approchaient dangereusement

8300093 la policiere a ete trop nerveuse cest sur mais comment on se sent quand on nous entoure aussi
8300094 ceux qui parlent de racisme si a avit t un blanc pointe aux trembles par exemple tout le monde aurait dit que ce qui lui est arriv est sa faute mais comme cest un immigr qui est mort l automatiquement tout le monde se mettent des oeill res et ne voient plus la r alit en face parce que c un immigr l a devient un acte de racisme de la part des policers come on un peu de jugeote svp

8300102 je ne permettrai pas que les policiers de la ville se fassent menacer comme cela
8300103 un largissement majeur sur une chelle encore jamais vue de tous les aspects de la vie d mocratique y compris au niveau de comment la police devrait oeuvrer doit faire partie l tape o nous en sommes de tout projet visant un changement radical de la soci t cela devra n cessairement faire partie de notre vision pour le futur ou il ny aura juste pas de socialisme
8300104 mais encore faudrait il sassurer au d part que cela ne se termine pas par la mise en place dune autre structure de plus qui ne serait quun autre cran de fum e de plus dans un environnement d j suffisamment opaque
8300105 cest dailleurs pas mal la m me chose pour ce qui est de la soit disante vie d mocratique dans les lieux de travail cela nexiste pas vraiment non plus
8300106 ce serait de rendre les autorit s polici res beaucoup plus redevables non seulement devant les autorit s politiques ceux et celles qui d tiennent le pouvoir mais aussi devant lensemble des autres lues cela doit faire partie de la lutte pour tendre encore plus la d mocratie dans notre soci t la population devrait galement tre capable de savoir ce qui se passe au sein de ces forces et dexiger une beaucoup plus grande transparence
8300107 advenant la prise du pouvoir au qu bec par un gouvernement de gauche il faudrait faire cest s r un bon m nage dans tous les services policiers mais d s maintenant on peut au moins commencer par exiger que la d mocratie puisse sappliquer jusqu et y compris au sein des forces de police
8300108 pourquoi faudrait il aussi que tous les policiers soient tout le temps et en toute circonstances arm s dans plusieurs autres pays ce nest pas le cas si on prenait juste la peine de prendre cette tangente on pourrait galement et ce fort probablement viter bien des drames

8300157 google has gone from innovative upstart to fat and happy industry leader in what seems like record time
8300158 we just had to get on with life very quickly we got used to the cameras we forgot they were there the cameras didnt change our behaviour at all except simon had to wear his pyjamas
8300159 it was a very gradual process we just became more and more confident with how they were going to portray us and more confident that we didnt have anything to hide
8300160 we came to respect what they wanted to do show that behind the closed door aspect of family life how things are resolved the love thats there in that family life
8300161 also its a fantastic thing to pass on to later generations of the hughes the great great great great granddaughter of the hughes that i will never meet will be able to look at it and say god doesnt he moan
8300162 our rule right the way through has been that if any family member doesnt want to do it we dont do it
8300163 we were not trying to find a family that symbolises britain because no family can do that but we didnt want to find the partridge family the extremes because theres enough drama conflict resolution without that you dont need to find a family on the margins or the fringe
8300164 when we met the hughes family we were delighted its a series over eight weeks about the universal themes of family life its real tv a documentary series lovingly crafted but not a piece of reality tv
8300165 the family was a brilliant series in 1974 one of the great documentary series but i dont think there has been a straight line from paul watsons series to this
8300166 it is the first time for a while that the issue of the family has been addressed head on pauls was the beginning of that tradition and this is the next turn of the wheel
8300167 i really liked them when we met and we met so many families they seemed bright honest and asked some quite difficult questions the fear is are people going to be honest and it was clear they were
8300168 the family seemed like a really good place to look at to tell you what life is like now

8300196 we think its unacceptable to use different methods of sexual expression as a way to judge peoples mental health
8300197 rfsu feels its wrong to classify these sexual practices as psychological diseases and believes its high time that these terms were removed from the whos and socialstyrelsens classification of diseases

8300215 youre a 30 year old police officer both taller and heavier than he was
8300216 this was a 12 year old boy from a childrens home who was clearly vulnerable and needed care and looking after
8300217 you still dont seem to accept that you assaulted this boy which concerns me
8300218 he was somebody in a stressful job in a stressful situation who took a step too far and paid a very high price for it
8300219 one or 2 is always pretty much the same thing
8300220 the change i feel is fans are really supporting me and telling me im still no 1 and still the best
8300221 i never saw my opponent before that was the tricky part
8300222 i think i have a great appeal to many fans around the world
8300223 maybe because i speak so many different languages and im so international i have a bit of an advantage im not sure
8300224 i thought the other guy played good for the pressure he was under
8300225 i went on a great roll the only thing i look back on that was a little bit unfortunate was that i was not able to stay ahead with the break in the third set
8300226 expecting the big three theaters in nyc to do more adventurous programming is like expecting my grandpa to not be racist
8300227 iran radical islamic government known sponsors of terrorism developing nuclear capabilities to generate power but threatening to eliminate israel
8300228 they dont pose a serious threat to us the way the soviet union posed a threat to us
8300229 you know iran they spend one 100th of what we spend on the military if iran ever tried to pose a serious threat to us they wouldnt stand a chance

8300231 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8300232 arizonans are also proud of their political tradition from barry goldwater to mo udall to bruce babbitt theres a pattern here
8300233 speaking for myself and for at least this coming election this is one arizona tradition id like to see continue
8300234 nowhere in that speech did she answer the question about his character his ability to lead the things that are at issue here
8300235 and until she does youre going to have a lot of hillary clinton supporters that are either not going to vote or are going to vote for john mccain
8300236 barack obama is a charming and fine person with a lovely family but hes not ready to be president
8300237 i want to get involved in writing emails to members of congress urging them to cut off funding for the war and other things but if i do that wont i end up getting put on a watch list

8300255 the leading nations that produce tea are in asia yet you do not have a luxury tea brand from the region
8300256 we felt that it was time for tea to evolve with the times to become not only a drink that is enjoyed by our grandfathers but a fashionable chic upmarket beverage for the young too
8300257 we also want twg tea to be a school of tea for the world a one stop shop where you can know everything there is to know about tea

8300275 using a consistent standard would enahance the nyses abilty to assess compliance with the independent director requirements because companies are required to disclose compensation in excess of 120 000 but are not necessarily required to disclose compensation between 100 000 and 120 000

8300286 its part of their belief system that this is not the right thing to do
8300287 this outbreak at least got going because it took hold in an unimmunized community so they are the ones who are really sitting ducks for infection
8300288 weve tried to do advertising to the general public about the importance of not sharing spit because thats how this thing has spread
8300289 the inspectors that are part of our union have expressed a concern that its simply keeping them too much off the facility floor where they used to actually get a chance to walk around and get a better feel for things
8300290 theyve introduced basically a documentation system that better tracks what activities take place both by the plant and by our members who inspect for the cfia
8300291 the system is supposed to make it more regimented make sure that everything happens in a particular fashion and from that perspective it would be good
8300292 added workload in terms of the documentation certainly doesnt have them feeling really comfortable about the amount of time they get to spend looking at things like sanitation and observing clean up procedures

8300305 whipping up hatred is not a good basis for fair taxation what matters more than retrospective taxation is properly working competitive markets which is what the energy regulator ofgem is there to bring about we are seeing old fashioned socialist hatred converting once again into high taxation
8300306 another reason that prices are going up is that the government are putting in place new charges and regulations such as the european union emissions trading scheme the renewables obligation and the climate change levy the government could reduce prices tomorrow by scrapping some of these ineffective regulations
8300307 imposing a windfall tax sends a message it tells business that if they make important investments that need to pay off with substantial profits later on we will punish them for it we might try and convince them that the windfall tax is just a one off and future investments wont be punished for being useful but they have no good reason to believe us
8300308 if the government increases spending to make use of the revenue from a windfall tax or fails to take action to plug ongoing gaps in the public finances then they have stored up fiscal problems for the future once the windfall is spent

8300340 apple states that the same hitachi deskstar drives are found in their line of apple xserve servers and meet or exceed the 1 million hour mean time between failure mtbf recommended for server grade hard drives the deskstar is in the time capsule
8300341 one of our key findings has been the lack of a consistent pattern of higher failure rates for higher temperature drives or for those drives at higher utilization levels
8300342 there is nothing that needs to be changed about time capsule its a typical apple product time machine is designed to bring backup to the masses the vast vast majority of people never backup because its too difficult time machine is seamless and invisible the day my mom called and said she restored some photos she deleted from iphoto a week ago using time machine was the day that i realized apple hit a home run with time machine time capsule is designed as a time machine appliance and in that capacity it works perfectly
8300343 its just not any better than similar flash offerings with sub 3 inch displays from sandisk creative microsoft iriver or apple
8300344 because not everyone salivates and loosens their jaw at the jiggling of the iphone or apples proverbial zipper thats why
8300345 the problem with microsofts implementation of the multi touch interface is that its not scalable because of the five projectors and pc combo underneath the glass you will never see the surface scaled down to a form factor thats smaller than a big azz table which means you wont see any laptop tech coming from microsoft with the surface interface you wont even see regular desktops that have surface components
8300346 that version of multi touch wont work without five big azz projectors beneath the glass so no you still wont see the surfaces version of multi touch in laptops
8300347 when you have a screen as big as the surfaces its okay that the touch implementation isnt scalable to pocket sizes
8300348 surface is essentially a windows vista pc tucked inside a table topped with a 30 inch reflective surface in a clear acrylic frame a projector underneath the surface projects an image onto its underside while five cameras in the machines housing record reflections of infrared light from human fingertips
8300349 imo it looks ugly and less professional than it should
8300350 wonderfly how they completely copied off the iphone in aesthetics curves aroudn the ednges with a chrome frame come on seriously everyone needs to stop copying apple and grow some creative balls for once
8300351 fred you went to great lengths and used the fullest potential of your wit in an attempt to insult me in which you have failed yet you give no reason as to why you think apple fans are stupid so for now i will assume this as a copy paste template in your personal hobby as an online antagonizer
8300352 head on over to engadget mobile for pictures and video of the little beast in action
8300353 all in all i have to say it is one of the most impressive pieces of technology ive ever laid my hands on
8300354 something tells me that apple has been negotiating behind the scenes to expand at amp ts wireless services in anticipation of this auction
8300355 well i guess i will keep dreaming for us to catch up with japan and south korea
8300356 but as they say its not the bandwidth of the spectrum its the motion of the frequencies
8300357 well maybe geoffrey should have come up with a better successor to the razr
8300358 prior to joining motorola mr brown was chairman and ceo of micromuse inc a network management software company before that he was president of ameritech custom business services and ameritech new media inc before joining ameritech in 1987 mr brown held a variety of sales and marketing positions with at amp t for five years resulting in 25 years of high tech experience
8300359 they need a stimulus package sale where you can get the device and 2 years for 600 even

8300365 we talked about this two years ago and it is exciting to see it come to life today
8300366 we wanted to begin this campaign as a way to build traditions around our football games we are such a young university and an even younger football program and we dont have many traditions because of that youth
8300367 today we are establishing a new code for our fans one that encourages appropriate behavior and a welcoming environment for the visitors and our home team fans
8300368 there was no question the student government wanted to support this campaign
8300369 our student fans are tremendous and i believe they are the best in the big east they are also competitive and passionate we want to make sure they express those emotions in the right way while being courteous to our opponent and their fans
8300370 what is the best alternative for the iphone iphone 3g i am looking for a touchscreen phone that has most of what the iphone can provide such as media and decent web browsing i am also looking for a device with a lower cost with or without a new plan could you please help point me in the right direction
8300371 looking for a touchscreen phone that has most of what the iphone can provide such as media and decent web browsing
8300372 im not into computers and i dont do the internet
8300373 is this indicative of who we are and how were doing business
8300374 would it be all right if we just sat and i wake up as britney spears shocked as hell watching myself on mtv right after the disastrous vmas
8300375 i appeal the people to leave the area right now our target is to save the women and the kids taken hostage by the militants once this is achieved it would become easy for us to carry on the operation easily
8300376 i heard firing in the morning and did not dare to come out i don t know how many are they the army people helped us to vacate the place
8300377 exclusive scientists warn that there may be no ice at north pole this summer
8300378 it seems unthinkable but for the first time in human history ice is on course to disappear entirely from the north pole this year
8300379 the summer meltback in the arctic has ended and the ice is on the march confounding the alarmists who were predicting in june that the pole would be ice free this year currently the ice area is some 600 000 square kilometres greater than it was at its minimum extent last year
8300380 we have started an investigation into the incident but no militant group in the niger delta has claimed responsibility for the kidnap and no ransom demand has been made
8300381 i think there is a huge potential for e bikes because of it is economical their running cost is only 10 paise per kilometer while the scooter or motorbike costs around one rupee per kilometer it is value for money
8300382 they are safe you can travel at 25 km per hour you do not require license registration and do not have to pay road tax but we recommend a helmet for safety
8300383 yeah all mega church pastors are selfish ego driven show hounds

8300390 can you imagine what they senior oncologists must feel like going to work every day and seeing people like us and knowing there is a drug there that they can give but they cant do it
8300391 we feel weve been left to go away and die quietly and we are not going to do that
8300392 all comments received during the consultation will be reviewed by the independent appraisal committee at their meeting in september 2008
8300393 following this meeting the appraisal committee will issue the next draft guidance
8300394 until nice issues final guidance on the use of bevacizumab sorafenib sunitinib or temsirolimus as treatment options for advanced and or metastatic renal cell carcinoma individual cases should be assessed at a local level within the nhs
8300395 i have to say that canon nikon and sony are all great but this still does not mean that olympus or 4 3 is not
8300396 in this case ff is doomed because it is smaller than medium format
8300397 well image quality does not matter right or if it does than we have to talk about sharpness colors etc and not just noise
8300398 again 70 200 f 4 0 seems to be a good portrait lens for me also it might be a 4 0 in terms of dof but not in terms of light and yes you can compensate it with higher iso but how are you going to compensate it if you are already using 100 iso which is the case in terms of studio photography
8300399 i also do not understand why you are comparing 4 3 to the cropped format this simply does not make sense for me you are so weird first you state that the 4 3 is doomed because of the sensor size and than you try to catch up throwing in the cropped format cheater
8300400 well again the d60 is not much bigger in terms of size than the 420 but it weights 1 5x of it also add the lenses and the size and weight difference will be even more
8300401 ok now tell me exactly how its ripping off an iphone
8300402 lets make ours look as close to this as is possible without being sued
8300403 step 3 add more functionality to it and better codec support
8300404 up to a 90 performance increase over the geforce 8600 gts gpu
8300405 they wouldnt take it out of the case by order of nvidia but we did get confirmation that the anticipated graphics king will launch before march is done for an undisclosed price
8300406 i put in bold the word you should be paying attention too please drink more coffee before commenting
8300407 good morning ladies and gentlemen welcome to this apple special event
8300408 welcome were really excited to share some great news with you about the iphone software roadmap weve got some cool stuff to announce so lets get on with it i want to share a few statistics about how far weve come with the iphone
8300409 as you know the iphone really brings the internet to a mobile device for the first time you have the internet in your pocket and thats being borne out by usage stats for mobile browser usage 71 of us mobile browser usage
8300410 so lets get on with what we have to talk about today ive asked two of my colleagues do the heavy lifting
8300411 first thing were going to talk about is iphone in enterprise
8300412 im really excited to be the one to talk to you abut iphone in the enterprise weve had some great customers at the forefront wanting to adopt the iphone into their enterprises
8300413 there are a lot of things enterprise customers have told us that have hold us back from being huge in the enterprise
8300414 thats a long list of important features enterprise customers want well im excited to be the one to tell you today were doing all these things in the next release of the iphone software
8300415 our customers have asked us to build in ms exchange right into the iphone we have licensed activesync for the iphone
8300416 thats a huge request but how does that work theres an old way
8300417 microsoft has come up with a much more advanced architecture where the iphone can work directly with the exchange server in a more reliable and affordable way were building exchange support so you get push email push calendaring push contacts global address lists and the ability to remote wipe it
8300418 the same email app calendar app and contact apps that customers really love will get information directly from the exchange server
8300419 no events i kind of like that keep my day free
8300420 its the same apps that customers know and love on the iphone but now its all coming from exchange
8300421 for those of you whove never typed into an iphone its awwwesome
8300422 i cant stop it the phones been wiped and protected
8300423 lots of great new features but youve seen exchange live working on the iphone weve been working hard on this
8300424 another company weve been working with is disney as you may know we have an executive relationship with disney
8300425 these are the features customers have asked for in the enterprise and i think when we release these features people will be blown away that the iphone is the best mobile device ever in enterprise
8300426 ok im here to tell you about how developers can build great apps on the iphone before i get into the sdk i want to give an update on web apps this has been incredibly successful there are over 1 000 web applications for the iphone
8300427 already the iphone is the most popular mobile device with bank of america it accounts for 20 of all mobile banking with them but today what i really want to tell you about is the native iphone sdk
8300428 starting today were opening the same native apis and tools to build our iphone apps
8300429 3rd party developers can build native iphone apps using the same sdk that we do there are a lot of pieces that make up the sdk in a set of apis that suits us well apple is a platform company we have the most advanced platform in the world in the form of os x its comprised of four layers
8300430 the core os core services media layer and cocoa to build the iphone os we took the bottom three layers to form the iphone os cocoa is interesting and its the best app framework out there but its based on a mouse and keyboard so we took everything we knew and built cocoa touch
8300431 this here is the architecture of the iphone os let me dig a little deeper well start with the kernel this is the same os x kernel based on the same project and same source files of os x the networking layer we use is the same bsd networking layer we use on os x and power management apple has more than a decade of experience in advanced power management
8300432 we started with those advanced power management techniques and went beyond that the core os power manages all of the chips all the sensors your application automatically
8300433 core location weve taken that and patched it into an api so you can create location aware applications the media layer starting with core audio this is the low level audio layer on top of that weve built openal an industry standard
8300434 video playback seamless video playback uses our h 264 codec built right in
8300435 core animation opengl es the embedded version of opengl and a screamer for 3d graphics on the iphone in fact this entire layer is heavily hardware accelerated
8300436 cocoa touch our advanced touch event system the accelerometer what you might not know is that its a full 3 axis sensor and you can use that in your apps as well this is the architecture for the iphone os the most advanced mobile platform out there we think were years ahead of any other platform we borrowed heavily from os x we started on the shoulders of a giant
8300437 we have a comprehensive set of tools to help developers create and debug apps lets start with xcode we started there and enhanced it to support the iphone now we use xcode to build the os and apps for the iphone what is xcode it starts as a great source code editor it knows all about the iphone sdk will code complete the apis for the iphone sdk
8300438 it also integrates directly with source control management system subversion cvs integrates with iphone sdk documentation and also has a nice debugger its also a great remote debugger plug an iphone in run the app live on your iphone and be debugging it from your mac this is incredibly powerful
8300439 the next tool id like to talk about is interface builder this is the tool youll use to wait for it build your application interface we have the complete library of iphone interface assets just drag them onto the canvas
8300440 we took those three and enhanced them for the iphone but theres a brand new tool the iphone simulator it runs on a mac and simulates the entire api stack on your computer
8300441 so we have a fantastic set of tools in addition to an amazing set of frameworks
8300442 its just as easy to build and run it live on an iphone
8300443 this is an app i just built in two minutes but we wanted to see what we could build in two days so we did this app we called it touch fx
8300444 next we decided what can we do in two weeks so we wrote a game touch fighter
8300445 dont just take my word on how good this platform is we called up a handful of companies and asked them to send out a couple of engineers to see what they could accomplish in two weeks with an sdk that theyve never even seen before
8300446 thanks to apple for inviting us to join in on the sdk process
8300447 id like to use the accelerometer to shake them into deals but were not gonna do that just yet
8300448 the next one aol which runs aim the most popular im service in the us
8300449 ive never developed on a mac before never used objective c and we had a live buddy list in five days this is a live conversation happening over the network
8300450 developing for the iphone is like developing for no other platform its an almost desktop like experience
8300451 segas been a household gaming name for more than 25 years
8300452 this is not a cellphone game its a console game if anything we underestimated what the iphone was able to do from the start we had to fly in another artist to scale up the art to match what the iphone could actually output
8300453 youre a dev and you just spent two weeks or a bit longer writing this app and whats your dream to get it in front of every iphone user
8300454 hopefully they love it and buy it but thats not possible today even the big developers would have a problem getting their app in front of every iphone user its called the app store and were putting it on every single iphone on the next release of the software this is how were distributing apps to the iphone
8300455 lets take a look at the app store featured apps just added staff favorites easy to find stuff and browse the categories of course i can see what the most popular apps are that are being downloaded i can easily search i can tap on it this ones free and its wirelessly downloaded over the air to the iphone via cellular or wifi
8300456 you can sideload them into the iphone as well from itunes but it goes further if youve downloaded an app and the dev updates that app the app store will tell you its been updated if you like it tap the update button and itll be replaced by the updated version all over the air automatically it will be the exclusive way to distribute iphone applications
8300457 devs are going to ask this is great but whats the deal whats the business deal weve got a great biz deal for developers you pick the price you want to sell your app at the dev gets 70 of the revenues right off the top we keep 30 to pay for running the app store no cc fees or hosting fees or marketing fees for hosting the app devs get 70 paid monthly
8300458 you know what price a lot of devs pick free when they want to distribute their app free theres no charge to distribute free apps well pay everything to get those apps out there for free will there be limitations of course some apps we wont distribute porn malicious apps
8300459 so weve talked about some amazing new enterprise capabilities weve talked about the sdk how are we going to deliver this stuff both will be delivered together in the iphone 2 0 software update let me tell you about that
8300460 it will again combine the sdk the new capabilities there will be a beta release going out today to thousands of developers we need their fantastic feedback were going to ship this to every iphone customer in june and its going to be a free software update
8300461 every iphone user will get what they saw today but theres another part to this as well the ipod touch everything will run on the ipod touch as well including enterprise features we account for the touch differently than we do for the iphone so there will be a nominal charge for the touch
8300462 we think a lot of people will want to become an iphone developer go to our site probably in about an hour and download the sdk you can join the developer program to test your app on the iphone and ipod touch and distribute your app to join the dev program costs just 99 if you have any questions about anything give us a ping at developer apple com
8300463 the premiere vc firm in the world kpcb and its my great pleasure the most well known partner john doerr
8300464 were all here today because we love apple products and im here because i really love apple entrepreneurs they do more than anyone thinks possible with less than anyone thinks possible the risk takers the rebels so its particularly touching to be here today with the supreme commander of the rebels steve jobs
8300465 steve started the whole personal computer industry when he left apple it went downhill fast he return and resurrected apple and even ran pixar please join me in a salute for the worlds greatest entrepreneur steve jobs
8300466 alan kay said the best way to predict the future is to invent it today were proud to announce the ifund for the iphone platform
8300467 new platforms are rare we gave a lot of thought to how to start an ifund so we decided the ifund should be 100m
8300468 that should be enough to start a dozen amazons and a few googles you know the mac and ipod are truly amazing platforms today were witnessing history thats the launching of the sdk the creation of the third great platform
8300469 its about this great opportunity but its about more than the money its about the great team at apple and the great talent we can recruit together if you want to build the future the ifund wants to help you fund it i cant wait to see the companies well build together
8300470 i look forward to working with you guys to do just that its very exciting if i could ask the press to just stay here for a few more minutes thanks for coming
8300471 if we can get the press to take their seats
8300472 we wanted to do a q amp a maybe ten minutes
8300473 its because they believe theres an opportunity to invest in the community we love young innovative developers and they love it because thats the business theyre in too it helps the whole ecosystem surrounding the iphone
8300474 do you think rim should be worried whats the message for them
8300475 you should ask them were not sending them a message were sending customers and developers a message that were trying to serve their needs remember the iphones been out less than a year this stuff will be shipping right around the one year anniversary to every iphone customer
8300476 what sort of safeguards are built in to ensure security
8300477 this is a big concern its a dangerous world out there weve tried to strike a good path here on one side youve got a closed device like the ipod it always works you dont have to worry about 3rd party apps mucking it up on the other side youve got a windows pc where people spend a lot of time every day making it usable we want to take the best of both reliability of the ipod but the ability to run 3rd party apps they get an electronic certificate if they write a malicious app we can track them down and tell their parents
8300478 we will only limit over cellular if you want to dev them for wifi thats fine
8300479 can people choose multiple sync methods lets say you select exchange will you also be able to use ical as well
8300480 yes you can have multiple accounts multiple calendar accounts multiple contact dbs only exchange account at time though
8300481 isnt the fact that apple is the sole distributor of apps likely to cause monopoly issues
8300482 we think this is going to be a boon for developers theres no other way to get an app in front of every single iphone user
8300483 well set that in june we dont look at this as a profit opportunity
8300484 what do you see as being the it ease of use so it managers can convert from blackberry to iphone
8300485 it uses activesync a familiar system but also has tools for managing these devices
8300486 is this an international rollout anything preventing open source apps
8300487 this is international but not an open source project its a for profit project only even though its a free update
8300488 working on a special app for internal enterprise applications its being worked on
8300489 whyd you change your mind from last year when you said web apps would be the only method of development for the iphone
8300490 whats relationship with the carriers are you working with the carriers on the app store
8300491 we have great relationships with our carriers we struck a new kind of relationship where apple is responsible on the phone we define the software on the phone we run the dev program we distribute the apps this is our program and were running it side q no rev share with carriers on apps we dont go into it but we like to see the revenue going the other way
8300492 in different times and different ways our heavenly father offers us a simple proposition follow me beyond what you can control beyond where your own strength and competencies can take you and beyond what is affirmed or risked by the crowd and you will experience me and my power and my wisdom and my love
8300493 does this mean i need to abandon the things i do well do i have to let go of my source of strength my gifts my passions my training my expertise no i dont think so those are good things from god
8300494 jesus knew that the father had put all things under his power and that he had come from god and was returning to god so he got up from the meal took off his outer clothing and wrapped a towel around his waist

8300501 and all of the crappy chinese cars you are talking about are pretty much the only cars that most commoners can afford in china
8300502 no one has yet released as elegant or functional of a product
8300503 um plenty of people have apple fanatics are just wired to never see those products as better in any way at all
8300504 please show me a single touch screen phone preferably one in the iphones price range that boasts the ease of use flexibility and expandability of the platform
8300505 and im referring to the full flexibility of the platform including sdk and jailbroken 3rd party applications
8300506 the iphone lacks several features some of them fairly large
8300507 but it is currently unmatched on the market in terms of pure user experience
8300508 and soon as a palm top computer for the masses
8300509 please show me a single touch screen phone preferably one in the iphones price range that boasts the ease of use flexibility and expandability of the platform and im referring to the full flexibility of the platform including sdk and jailbroken 3rd party applications
8300510 god the hatred for apple is clouding your mind you need to step back take a deep breathe and let go of this irrational fear or envy you have for apple it really is pathetic
8300511 and you guys complain about the lack of 3g when you know apple is about to release a new version every other complaint you have can be fixed in future software upgrades you guys dont have a fucking leg to stand on the iphone is revolutionary because of the platform os x on a phone with multi touch thats why its going to take over the market complain all you want but theres nothing you can do to stop that from happening and you know it
8300512 and you guys complain about the lack of 3g when you know apple is about to release a new version
8300513 the majority of people do not want what geeks want geek power of foresight is hampered by that reality apple will win because of ease of use yes you can probably do more on a win mobile device you probably have more features but no one is going to use those phones unless they can pick it up and just use it without consulting a users manual
8300514 hey this winmo device has more features but i know that how those features work and their usefulness matter more
8300515 if apple comes out with all the features that you complain about it lacking you will turn around and say hey you can get a insert phone here that does all those things for less
8300516 if dell sells you a 5 000 gaming pc yall will turn around and say that you can build buy a pc for 2 000

8300533 i love my mac so much because it always works its a quality product it also runs windows
8300534 switched to a mac because i was tired of crash delays after two solid years of using excel word and adobe cs on a mac with no virus issues or fatal error screens ill stay with mac and keep my pc for a boat anchor
8300535 what pcs can only print pie charts in black and white
8300536 hey mac have you seen my fancy new vista operating system it only took 5 years to make and for a few thousand dollers of hardware upgrades and several hours of frustration some pc users can get it to work and they love it
8300537 pcs are but business and macs are for eye candy
8300538 hello i heard so much about you and was going to talk to you but im already friends with pc so
8300539 i was up all night building a website for my cat
8300540 mac blows i run pc for gaming and thats about it linux and freebsd are where its at
8300541 ill let you listen to my music for a dollar
8300542 ok i think youre listening to something you shouldnt resolve this or bye bye os
8300543 and they dont deny the qualities portraied in the mac ads
8300544 well i didnt install that where did that program come from
8300545 i dont understand these at all they imply that you cant do serious work with a mac
8300546 tech geeks do it dirty with scsi ports only normal people cant understand it because its written in ancient coptic and the tech geeks arent quite sure about the meaning of the double entendre
8300547 yo i heard your mama cant do no cross tabulated spreadsheet
8300548 i know someone a mac user who is completely reckless while using a pc he thinks that he can just download anything without viruses ha
8300549 read post 171 from now on thats easier to type after a few beers
8300550 no ones ever going to need more than 640kb of memory anyway
8300551 i built an awesome pc with only 600 bucks or less
8300552 hello im a pc i wish i could be a mac in the place of a mac
8300553 mi choice is the best you all who arent like me suck big time
8300554 this is what everyone uses so i must use it too
8300555 mac even used one of their adds saying it can also run windows
8300556 awww macs suck cuz they cant play video games der der
8300557 neaa i pulled up three windows on my mac and it crashed
8300558 i built a great pc for 500 yeah u probably did of course we dont count the parts u found in the junk yard trash can
8300559 youre probably just a noob thats never really delved into the capabilities of a pc mac
8300560 its a finding that they failed to meet the basic essential needs of an inmate
8300561 we can pay for it when we can do some good or when you have to pick up the pieces
8300562 they are now considered essential parts of the health care structure in these communities
8300563 this case did seem to go on for quite a while
8300564 we can focus on our responsibility for those in our care and those we employ
8300565 if theres a conflict or a perceived conflict we cant represent them
8300566 im a good person and this has affected my life drastically
8300567 i feel management at mendota failed not only dennis strong but kelly vitense as well
8300568 on us sanity rests no more securely than a hat blown off in the wind
8300569 at a primal level i think madness is our deepest fear
8300570 id rather lose an arm or a leg than my mind
8300571 id say my beat was high people in low places
8300572 the surge will not work will actually make things worse
8300573 we are highly optimistic that we will get the grant and when we do we will go forward with appropriate funding with the greatest speed possible
8300574 this is highly important it is fundamental to public safety we have been hard at it to get the grant application in and to get people ready for the next part of it
8300575 however the court will comply with the law by jan 1 2010 no matter what

8300582 most christians and historians agree that the sermon on the mount contains the most spiritually inspiring words every uttered by jesus christ or any other religious leader
8300583 i can assure you senator that christ would never his emphasis not mine advocate turning the other cheek to terrorists and americas enemies as your smug laughter so clearly implied
8300584 but i say to you do not resist the one who is evil but if anyone slaps you on the right cheek turn to him the other also
8300585 but i say to you love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you
8300586 all they cared about was that her test scores were good
8300587 a lot of children are getting drugs they shouldnt be getting
8300588 physicians attempt to treat childhood psychiatric illnesses with medications used in treating adult psychiatric illnesses often in the absence of good information about the safety and efficacy
8300589 i get calls all the time from parents and schools demanding kids be put on these medications for behavior
8300590 we really dont know the long term effects of antipsychotic drugs on the brain
8300591 leaving a major medical disorder untreated is corrosive to a childs education its very detrimental to their development
8300592 look at the school so many different things can contribute to a kid having problems parents should talk to someone about non drug options and not take the medical quick fix
8300593 drugs are cheaper and easier than fixing a parenting dysfunction
8300594 kids need structure they need limits they need rules the biggest problem i see with parents is not setting limits and when a child disobeys they dont punish
8300595 she was in her room and she wanted to die
8300596 they recommended we send her away to a special boarding school that was about 100 000 a year
8300597 she couldnt go to school she was losing weight and staying in her room i thought i would see a child who was schizophrenic
8300598 within 10 minutes of meeting her i was astonished she was not only remarkably conversant she had a sense of humor more adult than childlike
8300599 i saw a child whose life was about to be ruined by more treatment
8300600 i said why dont you send her away to a wilderness camp and let her reboot
8300601 shes social nicole likes being a big fish in a small pond
8300602 shes totally changed in self confidence she doesnt need medicine
8300603 metadirectories and identity attributes are the molecules and atoms of the identity universe which came long before any concept of identity 2 0 which as a newcomer to the identity universe which might wind up being compounds
8300604 whats more likely 1 everyone standardizing on active directory or 2 everyone not standardizing on active directory
8300605 annoying uncle in the corner we dont like to invite to the party except for the fact its his house
8300606 staff found themselves working on a day to day basis without adequate support training or guidance about how to handle sensitive personal data
8300607 i know i shouldnt be doing this but im not doing this as a bad guy i just want to make my job easier
8300608 in my opinion the reason is more emotional that rational the market just isnt ready emotionally to completely outsource the management of their idm systems the whole thing seems so tied to their environment to their business processes that handing the management over to a third party just feels wrong
8300609 most companies are already outsourcing idm they just do it on a project basis
8300610 i think that the only solution is a pragmatic one where there is shared management
8300611 customers get to gradually let go and initially lean on the service provider as a very knowledgeable augmentation to their staff
8300612 if i were the person in charge of compliance and risk management id want to be able to look at the auditors police fbi upper management and lawyers after an incident and be able to say exactly what i did to protect my data and not say
8300613 the level of security one intends to achieve would depend on the amount of money one is willing to spend some would rest on this judgment alone to give an idm provider the keys to their gates i am sitting in chair just like that right now security is business driven
8300614 i blame schneider for last nights loss that throw was right at him on one hop we didnt get him for his bat he is supposed to be this great defensive catcher
8300615 its very likely tony bernazard would replace him which i doubt anyone wants
8300616 ibm said version 7 0 of its tivoli access manager enterprise single sign on which is expected to ship this fall will be the first ibm branded incarnation of encentuate single sign on
8300617 yeah we blew a seven run lead you know they played good baseball they cough the baseball they turned the double plays when they had to we couldnt add on they got hits at the right time and we were one out away and couldnt get it done i mean thats baseball i think youre gonna get a hard fought game and hard fought battles all the way through and thats the way its gonna be weve had some tough losses all year the sun will come up tomorrow and well play again thats the way baseball is and well be okay
8300618 in this stadium with this team you just never know five runs seven runs its never enough ive seen it before its not the first time the phillies never give up especially playing here this band box here is a perfect place for them to play and they know how to play in this field too they take advantage of the fans and everything that goes around its pretty bad that we lost the game but we battled and both teams battled hard to win this game today they won tomorrow hopefully well return the favor and everything will be back to normal
8300619 obviously this stings but weve been very good at recovering next day the last time we were here we had a tough loss and then we bounced back and won three straight from them
8300620 the other team gives you some inspiration lets put it that way
8300621 if you were a player and youre looking over in that other dugout youll feel a certain type of way
8300622 well the phillies played better fundamental baseball and thats why they won
8300623 no one is saying that brunlett didnt have to hit a baseball to tie the game
8300624 9 of 14 is that it is similar to the mets in game hot start then lie down and do nothing late in the clutch
8300625 were pleased to have a competitive field and exciting matchups in the inaugural charleston classic

8300762 these snails have an operculum a door that closes the shell
8300763 they can be out of the water for longer than other snails and when fed to fish they are not digested and sometimes come out alive this has a potential to alter the salmon and trout fisheries because they alter the food chain
8300764 in the western u s this species is of special concern largely because of their ability to modify ecosystems
8300765 in our most recent survey we were lucky if we found a few hundred per square meter
8300766 in lake erie they are not very abundant but it is unclear what they are doing 100 feet below the surface
8300767 the first is that any introduction of a nonnative species can cause worse problems than they were expected to cure the second is that these flukes have a multiple host life cycle infecting ducks that are apparently not affected before infecting the snails this might work in the west where the snails are in shallow water but no duck is going to dive 100 feet to get snails
8300768 that means that recreational water users must be very careful moving from one place to another we advise anglers to freeze waders and fishing gear or use formula 409 or something like that to kill the snails

8300801 you know i just realized im going to be paying 360 to take my board along
8300802 debit card use triggers 46 of all overdrafts according to the center for responsible lending
8300803 banks justify the practice as a way to ensure the most important debits get processed first say so a mortgage payment doesnt bounce
8300804 we thought the downside was limited the possibilities were reasonable and the amount of fun was limitless

8300810 tsa sometimes gives us different policies than they give you
8300811 are you kidding me i dont think when it comes to firearms tsa is going to surprise passengers with some magical policy to prevent them from checking firearms theyre allowed to check
8300812 your agent doesnt know your policy and is trying to tell me that you guys have secret policies
8300813 you were made late because of tsa theres nothing i can do for you

8300817 these truths mean that the each person must take more responsibility and make hard decisions that they would rather leave to others
8300818 the best way to own common stocks is through an index fund
8300819 its certainly been a difficult year but buying out a partner is never an easy thing
8300820 we have to work together again as we did two years ago or the joint venture will have to find its own solution
8300821 youre always engaged in discussion and negotiation we and ericsson are always discussing ways of making sony ericsson as successful as it possibly can be
8300822 we are looking forward to an excellent showing in new jersey this weekend the porsche has benefited from the recent adjustments made by grand am and now we feel every race is up for grabs
8300823 our friends at pontiac and mazda are fighting for a championship we wish them well but we will challenge for the win i welcome jim lowe and all the jlowe racing team members the transition has been smooth and now its time for business the two jlowe racing entries supported by us will add to the chances of porsche coming away with a win
8300824 im very excited to race on this new track in new jersey its always nice to be able to take part in an opening of a new track
8300825 it will be interesting to see how some drivers adapt to a track theyve never raced on i think it will be a close race after montr al where we had a good run going i know we can carry the momentum to new jersey and as we start to close the season it would be great to get another podium for farnbacher loles
8300826 our sponsors will be quite involved with our effort at thunderbolt due to the proximity of their headquarters out of new jersey and new york city
8300827 marquis jet is actually hosting a pre race event for all the grand am teams which will be really fun there will be a joint sponsored suite for 300 guests as well on race day it will be a good opportunity for our sponsors to entertain and network with clients and prospects but also enjoy the experience
8300828 i think new jersey will be a very exciting race for us its bryces home track and he will have some guests there so we are putting a lot of effort into this race hopefully well get a win by the end of the season

8300834 this the final instalment of our summer long mcc spirit of cricket challenge and thanks to the pca
8300835 the camps are a great way for kids to learn how to play cricket in a fun and fair manner and the fact that so many children attend shows how valuable they are
8300836 it is fantastic for the promotion of the spirit of cricket that international players take time out to endorse the campaign and encourage kids to play hard but fair and mcc is very grateful to matt for giving the youngsters his time ahead of the odi at the oval

8300850 i am the one who is who always was and who is still to come the almighty one
8300851 it was a bit of a rollercoaster a bit horrendous really the ups and downs of it it was really quite upsetting what happened thinking she was out took the edge off everything
8300852 we were all cheering and making a bit of noise when she won her first fight and we were happy with how she was looking against china but then we just couldnt believe it when the judges did not register the points for the kick we all saw what happened
8300853 when they announced the result we were obviously pleased again but then disappointed after the semi final
8300854 it was really hard for sarah to try and pick herself up after what had happened
8300855 it was lovely to see her at the airport and give her a hug it was absolutely fantastic to see all those people cheering and then the crowd starting chanting her name
8300856 i think she got even more attention than those who won gold
8300857 you wouldnt believe how shy she was back then no one at school even knew she did tae kwon do until she was 14 when she entered the world junior championships
8300858 she used to train with the gary sykes all stars and she owes everything to gary hes been her mentor all the way through hes been like a second father to her
8300859 our primary findings suggested that smoking physical inactivity and obesity are inversely associated with awareness of the psa test these risk behaviors are linked with higher prostate cancer morbidity and mortality
8300860 the results concur with our initial hypothesis that men who adopt unhealthy lifestyles may be less concerned with health and less aware of preventive measures like the psa test
8300861 these new findings have several clinical implications besides the impairment of sexual function in these young men
8300862 the lack of testosterone during these critical years may lead to diminished bone mass and the lack of development or lose of skeletal muscle in addition these patients may gain more weight with an average body mass index of 38 they already were obese and become more insulin resistant
8300863 also patients with low testosterone and type 2 diabetes have been shown to have very high concentrations of c reactive protein
8300864 which increases their risk of developing atherosclerosis and heart disease above and beyond the risk associated with diabetes
8300865 while obesity contributes to the association of type 2 diabetes and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism hh the association is not dependent entirely on obesity
8300866 in our first study of diabetic men we found that 31 percent of lean type 2 diabetics also had hh so it is likely that factors other than obesity contribute to hh possibly insulin resistance
8300867 whether obesity or insulin resistance is the major determinant of hh has to be addressed in future studies and the pathogenesis of hh needs to be defined
8300868 none of the more serious blasts where the loss of life and property was higher than in kanpur was handed over to the cbi for investigation
8300869 wanted to protect the bajrang dal which is an ally of the bjp
8300870 this only proves correct my earlier allegation that the upa united progressive alliance and the bjp bharatiya janata party are hand in glove
8300871 the up police its anti terrorist squad and special task force are competent enough to investigate such cases
8300872 i demand that the central government treat this as a national calamity and bear the full burden of relief and rehabilitation operations it cannot and must not be seen as a calamity of bihar alone
8300873 the first and foremost consideration of all political parties at this moment should be to save lives and alleviate the suffering of people
8300874 all you can eat whit al least 2 hours to eat what you want to eat
8300875 i want to make sure we do as well as we can and boost firm performance we need to get closer to clients and be a counselor and adviser to them to try to be proactive to clients
8300876 where else but in american can the son of a single mom emerge as the democratic candidate for president
8300877 where else but in america can a girl raised on the southside of chicago get an ivy league education
8300878 thats also an odd theory since right now congress hasnt taken any action to reverse the supreme courts decision and thus is as much to blame for the impact of the ruling at least prospectively on the court
8300879 certainly the cases in progress were not in a filing cabinet
8300880 sitting in my seattle office today im getting regular blog and twitter feeds about the presentations at the conference
8300881 im no longer buying that lawyers and other professionals in our legal industry are way behind the curve in the use of blogging social networking and social media
8300882 not worried about it theres places besides denver where we need and will get his help winning this election
8300883 suppose for example youre a voter and you have candidate x and you have candidate y
8300884 candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that person can deliver on anything candidate y disagrees with you on half the issues but you believe that on the other half the candidate will be able to deliver
8300885 this is the kind of question that i predict and this heas nothing to do with whats going on now but i am just saying if you look at five 10 15 years from now you may actually see this delivery issue become a serious issue in democratic debates because it is so hard to figure out how to turn good intentions into real changes in the lives of the people we represent
8300886 what his strategy is to go around drumming stuff on obama his crazy quotes and hes cultivated a careful reputation for being eccentric and therefore hillary is not blamed for what he does and the result is he can go around and dump on obama and almost be like a negative greek chorus
8300887 to defeat barack obama and make sure hillary can get elected in 2012
8300888 one of the most unique and beloved figures in the democratic party and the country
8300889 talk about why senator obama is the right leader right now
8300890 bill clinton knows a little bit about trying to yank the economy out of the doldrums
8300891 it wouldnt make sense for me to want to edit his remarks
8300892 bill clintons place in the hearts of democrats is very secure he rescued us from the wilderness
8300893 we had been wandering there for 40 years having lost three presidential elections
8300894 now were turning a page barack obama is going to be our next president and i expect bill clinton to be campaigning for him
8300895 he will assert that role in any number of ways well see one of those ways when he gives a speech at the convention
8300896 intimate interactions online representation and software of the self interactions magazine
8300897 he thought apparently the dvd case was a great spot to hide it from me and it was
8300898 my kids are pretty upset about the whole thing and i feel just heartsick

8300906 it was two against one you know and no one helped him
8300907 i didnt think that it would happen but it was not safe for him to work there
8300908 we also know through 75 years of experience that federal correctional facilities are managed most effectively through frequent and direct communication with inmates
8300909 i dont think that will diminish their communication at all
8300910 every single inmate in there is armed to the teeth for his own protection
8300911 i am not bruce lee so i cant take on 110 inmates by myself every day it is like david vs goliath you are taking on the world by yourself
8300912 the homicide rates among the inmate populations are at the highest levels theyve ever been in the history of the bureau of prisons
8300913 the assaults on staff whether weapons or no weapons has intensified
8300914 the safety and security of our staff continues to be the highest priority of the bureau of prisons

8300927 aku pernah bertanya kepada aisyah mengapa orang haid mengqadha puasa tetapi tidak mengqadha shalat aisyah berkata apakah engkau wanita haruri 1 aku menjawab aku bukan haruri tapi hanya sekedar bertanya aisyah berkata kamipun haidh ketika puasa tetapi kami hanya diperintahkan untuk mengqadha puasa tidak diperintahkan untuk mengqadha shalat
8300928 jima dengan sengaja tidak ada ikhtilaf perbedaan pendapat padanya bahwa hal tersebut membatalkan puasa adapaun jika jima tersebut terjadi karena lupa maka sebagian ahli ilmu menganggapnya sama dengan orang yang makan dan minum dengan tidak sengaja

8300957 de directe aanleiding nu was de noodkreet van de raad nederlandse detailhandel die waarschuwen dat er de komende jaren weleens 10 000 winkeliers hun zaak kunnen gaan sluiten omdat ze het gewoon niet meer bolwerken maar als sp pleiten we al veel langer voor ondersteunende maatregelen voor kleine ondernemers dit jaar nog werd een voorstel van ons overgenomen om kleine ondernemers met financi le problemen vrij te stellen van gemeentelijke belastingen helaas wachten we sindsdien op het wetsvoorstel dat deze stap in de goede richting mogelijk maakt
8300958 dat is veel te makkelijk gesteld ten eerste zijn kleine ondernemers ontzettend belangrijk zeker in wijken waar nu al veel problemen zijn winkeliers in de wijk zorgen ervoor dat bepaalde voorzieningen voor iedereen beschikbaar zijn en ze cre ren een stukje sociale samenhang mensen komen elkaar tegen praten met elkaar dat cre ert een band die zeker in wijken waar het leven soms al niet te makkelijk is ontzettend belangrijk kan zijn ook signaleren zij vaak omdat ze zoveel verhalen van buurtgenoten horen als eerste problemen waar de overheid die meer op afstand staat nog geen weet van heeft verder zou het verdwijnen van deze winkels tot nog meer leegstand leiden wat de komst van criminaliteit en verloedering weer in de hand werkt

8301342 application a word that we now recognize is a euphemism for interpretation sets itself on the wrong course each and every time it tries to draw hard lines of distinction between a present and earlier audience

8301387 the seagram building was the first modern building in a major metropolitan city to have a bronze curtain wall

8301400 seit wir revolve einsetzen k nnen wir die aufwandssch tzungen viel genauer vornehmen und sind so vor unliebsamen berraschungen sicher
8301401 au erdem konnten wir durch die gestiegene transparenz die fehler durch querauswirkungen von code nderungen deutlich reduzieren
8301402 wir haben in den vergangenen jahren bereits unsere auszubildenden ber die aktion perspektive jugend gefunden damit erreichen wir ohne umwege junge menschen aus der region die sich f r den berufseinstieg bei uns interessieren
8301403 ausreichende bewegung f rdert nicht nur die k rperliche leistungsf higkeit sondern wirkt sich positiv auf das allgemeine physische und psychische wohlbefinden aus au erdem macht k rperliche aktivit t lust auf die richtigen lebensmittel wir sprechen in der ern hrungswissenschaft von somatischer intelligenz
8301404 unsere erfahrungen zeigen eindeutig dass sich jugendliche sehr wohl bewegen lassen
8301405 entscheidend sind das engagement der betreuerinnen und der wichtigsten bezugspersonen der kinder sowie die schaffung von gen gend gelegenheiten zur k rperlichen aktivit t und zwar zeitlich wie auch r umlich
8301406 ziel des wettbewerbs war es eine aktive besch ftigung der 10 bis 14 j hrigen mit dem thema bewegung zu erreichen
8301407 vom bewegungsparcours f r den schulweg bis hin zu innovativen turn bungen der fantasie waren keine grenzen gesetzt
8301408 der pubert tsknick hat sich auch im schuljahr 2007 08 deutlich gezeigt erkl rtes ziel des projekts schule bewegt bewegte schule ist es diesen motivationseinbruch bei jugendlichen in der altersgruppe der 10 bis 14 j hrigen abzufedern
8301409 es gibt eine klare dosisabh ngigkeit des k rpergewichts von der zeit vor fernseher amp co sowohl die pr valenz als auch die inzidenz von bergewicht nehmen mit der t glich vor den bildschirmen verbrachten zeit zu
8301410 mit unseren take away bungen geben wir den couch potatoes unter den kindern und jugendlichen eine m glichkeit schnell und einfach die dringend notwendige bewegungsration f r den tag zu bekommen
8301411 und dies ist heutzutage absolut entscheidend denn was in den letzten jahrzehnten an allt glicher bewegung verloren gegangen ist wirkt sich letztlich in der energiebilanz der jugendlichen deutlich negativ aus
8301412 auch der zweite projektdurchlauf war absolut erfolgreich das feedback sowohl seitens der sch lerinnen als auch der betreuerinnen war durchwegs positiv bei einigen gruppen reichte der soziale zusammenhalt aus schule bewegt bewegte schule weit ber die schultore und auch ber den lokalen sportverein hinaus
8301413 der videobeitrag des siegerteams aus dem kreaktivwettbewerb plan be vermittelt vermutlich am besten mit welcher begeisterung die jugendlichen mit an bord waren an dieser stelle m chte ich mich vor allem bei den betreuerinnen vor ort bedanken die durch ihr engagement die f r jugendliche so wichtige motivation geboten haben
8301414 erst vor kurzem ist ein sehr spezieller auftrag bei uns eingegangen dabei handelte es sich um ein auf altdeutsch und teilweise in stenographie verfasstes handgeschriebenes buch ber phytotherapie die bersetzung und erfassung dieses manuskriptes war auch eine herausforderung f r uns der wir uns erfolgreich gestellt haben

8301417 my biggest concern about our football team is how we are going to handle ourselves
8301418 how will we perform are we going to have offside penalties mental breakdowns are we going to stay together i told the team we have 12 opportunities to play this season guaranteed if you want to get a 13th game then you have to take care of game one
8301419 i didnt really do that last year and now i think im ready
8301420 were ready to play against someone other than our own team so its going to be fun and a good experience
8301421 were going to have a full stadium and its going to be hot and loud

8301463 well hell thats cool nobody reads poetry anymore anyway and kids certainly dont smooth move mr cohen
8301464 well of course im a complete idiot because a little research will reveal that cohens been a singer songwriter since the 60s true hes published a quite a few books of poetry and even a couple of novels but music has always been his thing and i just never noticed
8301465 leonard cohen long before he was a singer songwriter was a well known successful poet and novelist and he was not a rock poet a folk poet or any other kind of pop songwriters are todays poets poet nope leonard cohen was and is the kind of poet who has a grasp of the craft of writing prose and poetry who knows a dactyl from a trochee who understands how an elegiac couplet varies from the heroic couplet he sold volumes of well reviewed poetry and novels before anyone thought of paying to hear him sing anything other than square dance tunes

8301496 shumpeter did not credit keynes with a single major improvement in the technique of economic analysis his admiration was confined to the skill with which keynes constructed a vehicle to convey his ideology fabianism an ideology that in schumpeters view rivals marx in undermining the pillars of capitalism
8301497 the fact that the loss of objectivity and the intrinsic value of the currency which is involved i e inflation will sooner or later make necessary on pain of ever increasing dislocation a growing degree of social control for the partial character of the policy will itself lead on to further measures the very fact that no stability no permanently workable solution can be found within the limits of this policy will ensure that once a community has been driven by events to tackle its problems in this way it cannot halt at the first stage but must of necessity push on to more thorough going measures of re organization

8301510 arent as troubled as some of us older folks are by reading that doesnt go in a line
8301511 thats a good thing because the world doesnt go in a line and the world isnt organized into separate compartments or chapters
8301512 they provide no measurable substitute for the intellectual and personal development initiated and sustained by frequent reading
8301513 its not on call at the touch of the finger learning is acquired mainly from books and most readily from great books
8301514 reading opens up doors to places that you probably will never get to visit in your lifetime to cultures to worlds to people
8301515 just then i notice like finally something sharp right in front of me
8301516 i gladly took it just like that until something terrible happen
8301517 you could add your own character and twist it the way you want it to be
8301518 but you could make it so that person doesnt die or make it so like somebody else dies who you dont like
8301519 no ones ever said you should read more books to get into college
8301520 what we are losing in this country and presumably around the world is the sustained focused linear attention developed by reading
8301521 i would believe people who tell me that the internet develops reading if i did not see such a universal decline in reading ability and reading comprehension on virtually all tests
8301522 what the net seems to be doing is chipping away my capacity for concentration and contemplation
8301523 these were kids who would typically not be reading in their free time
8301524 the question is does it change your brain in some beneficial way
8301525 the brain is malleable and adapts to its environment whatever the pressures are on us to succeed our brain will try and deal with it
8301526 reading a book and taking the time to ruminate and make inferences and engage the imaginational processing is more cognitively enriching without doubt than the short little bits that you might get if youre into the 30 second digital mode
8301527 it takes a long time to read a 400 page book
8301528 cover a lot more of the topic from different points of view
8301529 on the internet you can hear from a bunch of people
8301530 they may not be pedigreed academics they may be someone in their shed with a conspiracy theory but you would weigh that
8301531 kids are using sound and images so they have a world of ideas to put together that arent necessarily language oriented
8301532 books arent out of the picture but theyre only one way of experiencing information in the world today
8301533 they go through a lot of details that arent really needed
8301534 online just gives you what you need nothing more or less
8301535 i think its just more comfortable and i hate to say easier but it more meets the needs of somebody who might not be a fluent reader
8301536 based on where technology is going and the world is going
8301537 kids are smart when they want to do something schools dont have to get involved
8301538 are going to grow up having to be highly competent on the internet
8301539 theres no reason to make them discover how to be highly competent if we can teach them
8301540 some of it is the informal reading they get in e mails or on web sites
8301541 i was trying to imagine this and i was like i cant do this
8301542 what we want to do is to provide an alternative an option its not that people dont want to use mac os many people are open to the idea but theyre not used to spending an exorbitant amount of money on something that is essentially generic hardware
8301543 well forward all of these to apple so that we can ensure that not only murderdrome but that any comic submitted to apple doesnt fall foul of the same censorship
8301544 the plan is to hold murderdrome and concentrate on our other titles which will be more apple friendly
8301545 were more than happy to resubmit under any ratings system that apple suggests
8301546 the vp message was sent in the late hours of friday night and is by many accounts the single largest mobile marketing event in the u s to date
8301547 while much has been said of the timing and the scoop by news outlets obamas v p text message still ranks as one of the most important text messages even sent and one of the most successful brand engagements using mobile media
8301548 here obama branded himself as cutting edge inflated the already enormous press attention paid to his v p pick and further established a list of supporters most coveted form of contact their cell phone numbers

8301558 were obviously not going to knock on the door with a report book in our hands and get shot
8301559 if you err you err on the side of caution and thats what took place it wasnt that we were sitting around having a cup of coffee we were diligently trying to locate the suspect
8301560 i think in this game trying harder normally doesnt get you anywhere and i think thats such a hard thing to fight
8301561 you cant give 110 percent i think thats where we are theres no lack of preparation theres no such thing as guys not trying i think as a collective group sometimes youve got to try less to get more

8301575 my stepmother was never married to my father so i wasnt her child i didnt think she needed to provide for me so i went out and got jobs and tried to provide for myself as best as i could she had a daughter she needed to take care of i never saw my life as a crutch i just pretty much kept the same attitude through life
8301576 the guy is just an incredible young man very bright and a great leader
8301577 he is a community leader with a great heart you cant find a better guy than nic
8301578 nic just needs to do what we ask him to do and thats get calls to his corners communicate with his backers and safeties and make sure everyones on the same page
8301579 thats a big factor if a team makes a motion adjustment or were switching coverages nic needs to make sure everyone gets it
8301580 it leaves a sour taste but if you live in the past youll never make it to the future
8301581 right now were focused on this upcoming season and making sure we win our last game
8301582 were only as good as our weakest link and right now our weakest link is extremely good
8301583 if the other guys are playing hard well be able to cover up some mistakes that are bound to happen back there
8301584 its a tremendous advantage to have a front four like we have maybe those guys can take some of the pressure off the back seven but our front four can only do so much
8301585 and what a girl wants more than anything in the world is for their boyfriend to say i love you
8301586 the l word is not thrown around by men as easily as it is by women
8301587 when you do critical habitat that draws a line on the map but it doesnt add any additional protections
8301588 pretty sensitive to the basic prohibition under the endangered species act which is dont harm the species
8301589 we needed those players to get some games because some havent had much of a look in lately and there hasnt been any reserve games
8301590 we need them to get up to speed with the rest of the boys and a competitive match like this will do that
8301591 a lot of the players out there played in the championship last season so we had experience out there but it was also nice to see a young back four getting its chance i thought they coped well
8301592 buffoon line is the defence line get the jury to think of them as clowns and they might get a recommendation for a light sentence its also quite a good line for the evul government controlled media to take to minimize redneck backlash and to lessen the likelihood of copycat jihadis
8301593 since the beginning of this mobilization we have always said that any violence would not come from us but would come from the police our predictions appear to have come true
8301594 these people often form a narrowly focused school that is aimed at cementing the faith its based on if we continue as we are i think well just become more and more isolated sub groups in our community
8301595 the real threat to social cohesion comes not from parents exercising their parental choice but from governments that seek to force these parents to conform with the states ideas about how and what their children should be taught
8301596 instead of invoking moral principles for good conduct they invoke ethnic or national qualifications which is the seed of racist and tribalistic thought
8301597 the sportive knightly battle awakens the best human characteristics it doesnt separate but unites the combatants in understanding and respect it also helps to connect the countries in the spirit of peace thats why the olympic flame should never die

8301612 celtic rugby is always striving to align itself with other professional rugby tournaments around the world consequently this season will be the last that the magners league is played in its present format
8301613 i am pleased to announce that from 2009 10 we will be introducing an end of season play off to determine the magners league champions with the top four teams qualifying for the knockout stage
8301614 also going forward we intend to address the irregular nature of the competition by creating a rhythmic season achievable as magners league weekends will not compete with any other tournament
8301615 a grand final will provide a great day out for fans and commercial partners alike the emphasis will not just be about the participating finalists but a great celebration of celtic rugby on and off the pitch
8301616 the pfa who represent james milner are disappointed that information regarding james request for a move and the circumstances surrounding it have come to the publics attention and we feel we have no option but to respond
8301617 the facts are that james transfer request was actually handed in on wednesday august 20 at which point it was asked by newcastle united to keep the matter private
8301618 the request was given because the player was looking for an improvement on his contract that reflected his development and his value to the club there is a meeting between the owner and all relevant people at the club today wednesday when we believed james request was to be discussed
8301619 to clarify the situation james did sign a contract 12 months ago however this agreement was reached with the club nearly 12 months previous at the point in which newcastle had agreed to sell james to aston villa on transfer deadline day 2006 before canceling the agreement at the 11th hour

8301636 crude can be replaced and brought in via tanker but bringing a damaged refinery back up again can take a long time as we saw with katrina and rita

8301638 i think gustav is overshadowing the eia report it doesnt appear to having an impact
8301639 yes but he may need to work on energy and taxes two economic issues that have been the target of several recent mccain ads obama has a comfortable eight point edge on economic issues overall 51 to 43 percent
8301640 but the mccain ads may have come with a cost half the public thinks mccain has attacked his opponent unfairly while only a third feel that way about obama
8301641 neither candidate scores well on that measure and the conventions are the first and best chance to present clear solutions to current problems

8301645 even if a daughter takes after her dad theres still a bit of her mom in her
8301646 if something happens to make me really angry i have to take a deep breath to prevent myself from lashing out which is something she never did
8301647 ive always been uber organized and shes the same way
8301648 lauren was always a perfectionist she used to clean out closets when she had nothing to do
8301649 its really cool to see your children come full circle

8301652 employment expectations for both manufacturing and service sector hiring are at the lowest september levels in four years

8301654 what drivers dont realize is that ethanol is one third less energy per gallon
8301655 so if i have a gallon of gas sitting here and a gallon of ethanol im going to get more energy out of a gallon of gas than on a gallon of ethanol
8301656 virtually every car on the road runs on e10 just fine with no problems whatsoever
8301657 you can immediately go to 14 billion gallons of ethanol without having to worry about infrastructure concerns like the cars engine or gas pumps or anything like that
8301658 so if you have a non ffv and you pump it into your vehicle youre going to have a very serious large expense in front of you to the tune of thousands of dollars vehicles that dont run on e85 if you do pump it into those vehicles the problem is it will corrode the fuel lines the tank the fuel pump destroy the fuel filter etc
8301659 if you are comparing performance and that kind of stuff e85 is an extremely high performance fuel and thats why the indy racing league runs exclusively on ethanol
8301660 today ethanol is becoming far more of a viable alternative to gasoline as will other technologies like hybrids and plug in hybrids and all of this other stuff that will come its ethanol that is the first foot in the door
8301661 the energy crisis is this country today is such that we cant afford to take any options off the table biofuels and ethanol in particular offer us a very logical and a very easy first step
8301662 charlie gibson anchor of abcs world news with charlie gibson stopped by our suite for a guest appearance on 7news at 5 p m

8301668 basically the whole convention so far can be condensed into the following words and phrases hope change eight years of bush cheney four more years of the same dream barack obama every speech seems to be a mixture of these phrases once in a while a lame joke was thrown in for good measure but besides that it was more of the same
8301669 maria shriver california first lady and wife of gov arnold schwarzenegger was part of the extended kennedy clan on hand here in denver tonight to pay tribute to her uncle sen ted kennedy shriver wiped away tears as she watched kennedy take the stage to loud applause of course no sign of arnold as bipartisan as he talks about being even he wouldnt commit the political sin of showing up at a democratic convention schwarzenegger often talks about his uncle in law in fond terms and occasionally as the source of jokes

8301683 new trilogy of dark fantasy romances featuring fallen angel heroes and set in a gritty urban future
8301684 i think everyone was shocked to hear that the americans were holding this woman at bagram in afghanistan from the information coming through i am told she is being held in exactly the same conditions as the men and has absolutely no privacy when it comes to toilet and shower facilities
8301685 this would never happen to a western woman and it shows just how women are viewed by the u s military there is even a suggestion she has been molested and sexually abused by her captors we need to demand the truth
8301686 i was released on humanitarian grounds mercifully my treatment was good respectful and decent although still terrifying
8301687 i remembered moazzam telling me about the womans screams and how he first imagined they could be from his wife in truth i thought maybe he had just been listening to a tape recorder as part of a form of mental torture
8301688 however we now know the screams came from a woman who has been held in bagram for some years and without compromising anyone we can also reveal from impeccable sources that her prison number is 650
8301689 this information has been enough to scramble the pakistan media into action by demanding the return of this woman to her homeland immediately
8301690 prisoner 650 is just the tip of a very nasty iceberg of human rights abuses illegal detentions and rendition flights it is a shameful episode in pakistans history which must be put right
8301691 i wonder how can we hand over our sister to the non muslims for their illegal trial by men whose history is full of rape and other abuses to prisoners
8301692 i began to hear the chilling screams of a woman next door why have you got a woman next door they told me there was no woman but i was unconvinced those screams echoed through my worst nightmares for a long time and i later learned in guantanamo from other prisoners that they had heard the screams too
8301693 while on the run one not only confirmed he had heard a womans screams but said he had seen her
8301694 my story made international headlines front page pictures and major stories on tv but there has not been one word not one paragraph about prisoner 650 the grey lady of bagram a murderous detention facility under control of the u s military and intelligence services
8301695 all like the grey lady of bagram have been illegally abducted by secretive intelligence agencies they began disappearing in 2001 during the so called war on terror

8301697 i want you to come to know of the concern and dedication that this simple woman had for islam as described by those who knew her a dedication that was manifested by way of actions that were very simple and easy yet seldom carried out by those who are able

8301700 she wrote three guides for members who wanted to teach others about islam on the groups website siddiqui explained how to run a dawah table an informational booth used at school events to educate people about and persuade them to convert to islam

8301702 not going out of her way to be noticed by anybody or to be anyones friend she just came out here to teach us about allah and english wasnt even her first language

8301706 this is a woman who attempted to blast her way out of captivity
8301707 it was her decision as she refused to by seen by a male doctor
8301708 there remains only one obstacle from which the enemy calls him from and this is an obstacle that he must face if anyone were to be saved from this obstacle it would have been the messengers and prophets of allah and the noblest of his creation this is the obstacle of satan unleashing his troops upon the believer with various types of harm by way of the hand the tongue and the heart this occurs in accordance with the degree of goodness that exists within the believer so the higher he is in degree the more the enemy unleashes his troops and helps them against him and overwhelms him with his followers and allies in various ways there is no way around this obstacle because the firmer he is in calling to allah and fulfilling his commands the more the enemy becomes intent upon deceiving him with foolish people so he has essentially put on his body armor in this obstacle and has taken it upon himself to confront the enemy for allahs sake and in his name and his worship in doing so is the worship of the best of worshippers
8301709 if ghayrah protective jealousy leaves a persons heart his faith will follow it
8301710 we do know she was at bagram for a long time it was a long time according to my client she was there for years and she was held in american custody her treatment was horrendous
8301711 in that open situation we were forced to keep our voices low as we were aware that we were video and tape recorded the whole situation made it impossible for me to meet properly with my client
8301712 well what right do you have to speak about them then

8301714 to get the best possible rates it pays to know about the four cs that underwriters consider
8301715 those cs include credit history capacity capital and collateral score well in each category and youll fly through the lending system
8301716 lenders use the four cs because they need a quick and fair way to grade the mortgage applications they receive the idea is to match the right borrower with the right loan to assure that borrowers pay no more than they should for real estate financing for borrowers the importance of this system is to know how it works so you can get the best possible financing and refinancing

8301718 i have invited solana and blair to visit gaza and get to know personally the situation of the refugees but they have declined the invitation
8301719 the issue is one of justice not of distributing food parcels and medicines to people in need without a system by which israel is held to account for its actions justice does not exist
8301720 israeli policies are designed to limit the number of palestinians living in areas earmarked for settlements or in their vicinity
8301721 the israeli authorities have for many years applied a discriminatory policy of house demolitions permitting on the one hand many tens of israeli settlements to be built on occupied palestinian territory in flagrant violation of international law at the same time as they confiscate palestinian lands forbidding the palestinian population to build and destroying their houses the cleared land is often used to build illegal israeli settlements international law prohibits occupying powers from building settlements for their own citizens on the territories they occupy
8301722 in his 1965 autobiography edward bernays recalls a dinner at his home in 1933 where karl von weigand foreign correspondent of the hearst newspapers an old hand at interpreting europe and just returned from germany was telling us about goebbels and his propaganda plans to consolidate nazi power

8301724 aafia has been put in a new york jail was produced before a judge in new york and would be heard before a judge in new york while the public sentiment in new york was so anti aafia that the dailies have started calling aafia a suicide bomber
8301725 from me and my family we do not blame any muslim for what has been happening to our sister for the last five years our allah will take revenge for us
8301726 the government had been in contact with us during the last five years and has been saying that dr aafia would be back in a few days
8301727 now we have been told that all the three children were fine but looking at aafias condition we fear that the children might be in danger
8301728 it is immaterial who handed over aafia to the fbi but i am proud of being a pakistani after looking at the support from the civil society and the media and my heart wishes that i should go out and shout at the top of my voice that i am a proud pakistani a nation which has stood by its daughter
8301729 what i want is to bring aafia back to pakistan and i beg the media and the government to do something for aafia and bring her back
8301730 the americans would send her to jail for 40 years then what would we do aafia was not a green card holder then why she was being tried in new york

8301744 little by little european powers collusion in the kidnap rendition and torture of terrorist suspects is coming to light
8301745 we now know that the cia operated black sites in poland romania and apparently even on british territory in diego garcia
8301746 on many occasions cia aircraft have been allowed to land on or cross european territory en route to the kidnap and rendition of ghost prisoners to torture in secret prisons in countries like syria jordan and egypt in addition european governments have allowed hundreds of prisoners to be ferried through their jurisdiction to illegal imprisonment torture and cruel inhuman and degrading treatment in guantanamo bay the u s run camp in cuba
8301747 we are the palestinian red crescent ambulance he told me we were called by israeli soldiers to pick up your body and get you to a hospital behind him an israeli soldier approached the ambulance insisting the emts emergency medical technicians would not be permitted to move me until i signed a paper first of all anything signed by a person incapacitated cannot be binding thou this is a technicality often expunged from israeli protocol fortunately people were looking out for me the driver asked the soldier what kind of paper and the soldier explained that it would indemnify the israelis should anything happen once i was transferred into palestinian custody in other words if i died or was permanently disabled as a result of israel s actions israel could not be held accountable one would think i was in a third world dictatorship rather than the only democracy in the middle east one would think thou i could not see him i recognized the voice of the soldier as avi the emt replied hes unconscious you cant make him sign something he cannot read and we dont know yet what you did to him during the interrogation
8301748 i did catch daryl reviewing her notes and offered some pointers on the ebox since she was more of a bio diesel proponent and to my knowledge not well versed on evs
8301749 im glad it did since wyatt asked several questions on the specifics of the car there were a couple of answers that were shall we say less than correct so i cringed knowing what might be done in the daily show editing suite

8301761 it is a lie i never went to a religious school i have not heard of those names before i only went to school in pakistan
8301762 to position themselves near the mosque and to wait for an american target to pass as an american vehicle passed the second individual ordered the detainee to throw a grenade into the vehicle
8301763 nobody asked me to throw a grenade i have never thrown a grenade i dont understand how to throw it
8301764 stated originally he was not the person who was supposed to throw the grenade but that the grenades were passed to him at the last minute the other individuals told the detainee to throw the grenade so he did
8301765 that is not true i told them the interrogators in my statement that i was the person who did not throw the grenade
8301766 caught by a local police officer at the site of the explosion
8301767 made a written confession to this attack signed it and marked it with his fingerprint
8301768 they tortured me they beat me they beat me a lot one person told me if you dont confess they are going to kill you so i told them anything they wanted to hear

8301772 a senior afghani official stated he heard the detainee admit to throwing the grenade at the two united states soldiers
8301773 told me it was a bomb and that i should go and throw it in the river i put the thing back in my pocket and i was running and shouting to stay away its a bomb when i got close to the river people the police caught me
8301774 i cannot accept this injustice if i have to stay in this jail i want to put an end to this suffering
8301775 i was shocked because except for a period during his torture in 2002 mohammed has not been suicidal or self injurious at guantanamo
8301776 he felt the saudi government has thoroughly abandoned him and as if he is surrounded by people the u s military who want to kill him he has lost all hope although the charges have been dismissed for now im not sure how he will survive having the threat of new charges hanging over his head
8301777 i am feeling great frustration and hopelessness if this situation continues i will find a way to take care of myself and end this suffering
8301778 although the u s continues to threaten to bring charges against our client before these sham commissions their evidence and every statement he has ever made was extracted through torture or threat of torture because he is basically unprosecutable and incapable of participating in his own defense hes at serious risk of indefinite detention without end and has made clear that that is not a situation he can survive
8301779 his may be the most heavily documented abuse and torture at guantanamo
8301780 how do you legally set a framework that prevents abuses and allows for a vigorous system that protects intellectual property
8301781 to be very careful and sensitive these days the russians are selling many arms to iran and syria and there is no need to offer them an excuse to sell even more advanced weapons
8301782 israel should be proud of its military which trained georgian soldiers
8301783 we did see that there was potential for a conflagration in the region but georgia is a friendly state its supported by the u s and so it was difficult to refuse
8301784 when they criticize negatively we know its good because this is what we call viral marketing
8301785 stem cells will be the hot subject for the next 50 years
8301786 looking at the draw may be a little different having to start at the bottom but thats ok
8301787 i never saw my opponent before never saw him play that was the tricky part i thought he played good for the pressure he was under but then i went on a great roll
8301788 i saw him on the little screen i saw them play a few points so thats all i really know of him it would have been probably easier to play paul capdeville who i played here last year here
8301789 the change i feel is fans are really supporting me and telling me im still no1 and still the best youre going to be there again so i feel like ive got unbelievable support from the fans watching me and people in the streets which is really nice

8301797 its almost as if mr harper is excited about the consequences of climate change
8301798 its fine to talk about the economic potential and contribute government money toward it but if its premised on a kind of gold rush mentality instead of a stewardship approach focused on sustainable development this gold rush that mr harper is stimulating could actually end up causing great harm

8301816 it is not a time we can expand state benefits
8301817 this is 4 million that would have to be taken out of other state programs

8301823 they are a good team and they have nine of the players who played against england in 2006 and they beat croatia 2 0 in 2007 at home so its going to be a very difficult game but thats the world cup
8301824 its the biggest competition every country in the world takes part and its an exciting time
8301825 we have to go in there with belief and give it our best shot to try to qualify

8301829 perhaps you could do some reading about what has happened to civilizations in the past which outconsume their resources
8301830 these slippers are in high demand apparently because they provide the chance to express dissatisfaction with the american policies without running the risk of being arrested or beaten up in street protests against america

8301838 i was out of mainstream school for three years and then i got referred to the centre i didnt settle in at first but gradually i came out of my shell with the help of the tutors now i have a lot more confidence in myself and i am able to deal with my own problems
8301839 exclusion from school leaves young people vulnerable to low self confidence and few aspirations for the future lack of learning and qualifications only serves to worsen this situation
8301840 we believe that sarc is one of the first centres of this kind to be established by a housing association and it has proved to be an excellent move the fact that kcc have asked us to extend the sarc for a second year is testament to the hard work of its staff and students
8301841 amicushorizon is committed to improving our residents communities and we hope that the centre will continue to improve the futures of young people in sheppey for years to come
8301842 we just had to get on with life very quickly we got used to the cameras we forgot they were there the cameras didnt change our behaviour at all except simon had to wear his pyjamas
8301843 it was a very gradual process we just became more and more confident with how they were going to portray us and more confident that we didnt have anything to hide
8301844 we came to respect what they wanted to do show that behind the closed door aspect of family life how things are resolved the love thats there in that family life
8301845 also its a fantastic thing to pass on to later generations of the hughes the great great great great granddaughter of the hughes that i will never meet will be able to look at it and say god doesnt he moan
8301846 our rule right the way through has been that if any family member doesnt want to do it we dont do it
8301847 we were not trying to find a family that symbolises britain because no family can do that
8301848 but we didnt want to find the partridge family the extremes because theres enough drama conflict resolution without that you dont need to find a family on the margins or the fringe
8301849 when we met the hughes family we were delighted its a series over eight weeks about the universal themes of family life
8301850 its real tv a documentary series lovingly crafted but not a piece of reality tv
8301851 the family was a brilliant series in 1974 one of the great documentary series
8301852 but i dont think there has been a straight line from paul watsons series to this
8301853 it is the first time for a while that the issue of the family has been addressed head on pauls was the beginning of that tradition and this is the next turn of the wheel
8301854 i really liked them when we met and we met so many families they seemed bright honest and asked some quite difficult questions the fear is are people going to be honest and it was clear they were
8301855 the family seemed like a really good place to look at to tell you what life is like now
8301856 some seem to believe that we should negotiate with the terrorists and radicals as if some ingenious argument will persuade them they have been wrong all along weve heard this foolish delusion before
8301857 we have an obligation to call this what it is the false comfort of appeasement
8301858 its the stuff about his preacher and the thing he said about pennsylvania towns how they turn to religion
8301859 account to be taken of the dignity of creation when handling animals plants and other organisms
8301860 you know if we make this hard enough best buy can make some extra money off of geek squad
8301861 yo best buy sells lousy products that are hard to use
8301862 yo you have to take it back because there isnt a remote control with the returned system
8301863 you mean i have to stuff this thing in the car again and come back to get a refund and or exchange
8301864 yes because our policy is that we dont want anything happening to the system if it were to happen we dont want it to be our responsibility
8301865 if we set this up and if it works will you take this back with you
8301866 no i just want to return the system i spent too much time on it already
8301867 you dont understand i dont want the system its too hard i just want to return it
8301868 is not the right tool to set u s climate change policy
8301869 this has been a difficult decision but in light of the scientific record and the restraints of the inflexible law that guides me i believe it was the only decision i could make
8301870 open the door for activists to force the adoption of limits on greenhouse gas emissions linked to global warming
8301871 kempthorne made clear that the decision would not justify regulating emissions from power plants vehicles or other human activities
8301872 i took part in a photo shoot that was supposed to be artistic and now seeing the photographs and reading the story i feel so embarrassed
8301873 i never intended for any of this to happen and i apologize to my fans who i care so deeply about
8301874 mileys parents and or minders were on the set all day since the photo was taken digitally they saw it on the shoot and everyone thought it was a beautiful and natural portrait of miley in fact when bruce handy interviewed miley he asked her about the photo and she was very cheerful about it and thought it was perfectly fine
8301875 unfortunately as the article suggests a situation was created to deliberately manipulate a 15 year old in order to sell magazines
8301876 if you think theres something wrong with this you have a dirty diseased mind theres nothing necessarily sexual about it
8301877 the lds church reached an agreement with jews to not baptize holocaust victims without their direct survivors permission
8301878 a little less talk six steps to get some action from the accra agenda
8301879 we believe that the listing was unwarranted and that its unprecedented to list a currently healthy population based on uncertain climate models
8301880 the simple fact is that the endangered species act is not a means to address the global challenges of climate change which call for a global solution
8301881 has a 750 person crew to bring around the world it is a difficult challenge
8301882 i would like to think that we both work pretty hard for the rights of indigenous people and for the rights of conservation of the amazon rainforest but we do need to get around

8301886 concerns the membership of the church because a true church can obviously only be made up of people who are regenerate and who display reformed lives observing the truth and living blamelessly before men
8301887 many took up the title of christian who were still profane superstitious carnal proud greedy luxurious indeed they rushed into the churches in crowds
8301888 from this influx it is not surprising that the doctrine of faith and most especially that of the new birth became so rapidly corrupted in the churches until at length christian church discipline was remodeled on the fashion of the pagan secular state
8301889 and so it came about that faith was neglected doctrine no longer studied regeneration equated to the mechanical performance of the rite of baptism by that time most of the world had taken up the christian profession so at length everything that had been instituted by christ was basely transmuted into another gospel

8302009 my constitutional shyness has been no disadvantage whatever in fact i can see that on the contrary it has been all to my advantage my hesitancy in speech which was once an annoyance is now a pleasure its greatest benefit has been that it has taught me the economy of words i have naturally formed the habit of restraining my thoughts and i can now give myself the certificate that a thoughtless word hardly ever escapes my tongue or pen i do not recollect ever having had to regret anything in my speech or writing i have thus been spared many a mishap and waste of time experience has taught me that silence is part of the spiritual discipline of a votary of truth proneness to exaggerate to suppress or modify the truth wittingly or unwittingly is a natural weakness of man and silence is necessary in order to surmount it a man of few words will rarely be thoughtless in his speech he will measure every word

8302055 the materialist conception of history starts from the proposition that the production of the means to support human life and next to production the exchange of things produced is the basis of all social structure that in every society that has appeared in history the manner in which wealth is distributed and society divided into classes or orders is dependent upon what is produced how it is produced and how the products are exchanged from this point of view the final causes of all social changes and political revolutions are to be sought not in mens brains not in mens better insights into eternal truth and justice but in changes in the modes of production and exchange
8302056 the first premise of all human history is of course the existence of living human individuals thus the first fact to be established is the physical organisation of these individuals and their consequent relation to the rest of nature men can be distinguished from animals by consciousness by religion or anything else you like they themselves begin to distinguish themselves from animals as soon as they begin to produce their means of subsistence a step which is conditioned by their physical organisation by producing their means of subsistence men are indirectly producing their actual material life
8302057 according to the materialist conception of history the ultimate determining element in history is the production and reproduction of life more than this neither marx nor myself have asserted hence if somebody twists this into saying that the economic element is the only determining one he transforms that proposition into a meaningless abstract and senseless phrase
8302058 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past the tradition of all dead generations weighs like an alp on the brains of the living
8302059 men make their own history whatever its outcome may be in that each person follows his own consciously desired end and it is precisely the resultant of these many wills operating in different directions and of their manifold effects upon the outer world that constitutes history
8302060 what we are dealing with here is a communist society not as it has developed on its own foundations but on the contrary just as it emerges from capitalist society which is thus in every respect economically morally and intellectually still stamped with the birth marks of the old society from whose womb it emerges
8302061 lies the period of the revolutionary transformation of the one into the other corresponding to this is also a political transition period in which the state can be nothing but the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat
8302062 we declare that the first life cycle of modern society is coming to its end for the past 200 years from french revolution 1789 to the present day
8302063 both methods found it impossible to solve the major problems of mankind these include poverty hunger exploitation sexism racism the destruction of natural resources and the lack of a true democracy therefore our time is characterized by the end of the major social projects of the upper class and the historical working class which have dominated our era emerging global society opens up to a new civilization participative democracy socialism of the 21st century
8302064 throughout the world products and services of all sorts are urgently needed but in spite of this in western europe 35 million people are out of work on a world scale the figure 820 millions almost one third of people on productive age and the global flow of capital which is increasingly concentrated does not create new jobs or material values they are no longer aimed at profits but only to generating interest the volume of the flow of capital has increased ten times in the last six years now more than a trillion dollars changes hands every day on a world scale only one percent of this quantity 10 billion a day for transactions of world trade 99 percent of monetary transactions are purely speculative
8302065 the most precious gift of humanity reason is being stripped of all critical elements to remain in a purely instrumental state however criminal and amoral the end might be instrumental reason is at its service with the only function of bringing about the means from the daily theft of the surplus value of the worker to the scientific killing of oppositionists in the subworld of the global village the ethics of civic coexistence and solidarity have been replaced by the morality of the strongest which justifies the agony of half the human race in terms of its incapacity to compete in the modern roman circus that is the world market
8302066 in the social production which men carry on they enter into definite relations that are indispensable and independent of their will these relations of production correspond to a definite stage of development of their material powers of production
8302067 in considering such transformations a distinction should always be made between the material transformation of the economic conditions of production which can be determined with the precision of natural science and the legal political religious aesthetic or philosophic in short ideological forms in which men become conscious of this conflict and fight it out
8302068 little more than the register of the crimes follies and misfortunes of mankind
8302069 for philosophy arose only when the necessities and the physical and mental comforts of life had been provided for
8302070 the human being functional to its interests as a producer of commodities and realiser of surplus value
8302071 the most precious gift of humanity reason is being stripped of all critical elements to remain in a purely instrumental state

8302073 cromwell replaces the three dominant institutions of the old regime the monarchy the vatican and the aristocracy with the parliament the protestant national church and the developmental desarrollista market economy
8302074 the great men who in france prepared mens minds for the coming revolution were themselves extreme revolutionists
8302075 we know today that this kingdom of reason was nothing more than the idealized kingdom of the bourgeoisie that this eternal right found its realization in bourgeois justice that this equality reduced itself to bourgeois equality before the law that bourgeois property was proclaimed as one of the essential rights of man and that the government of reason the contrat social of rousseau came into being and only could come into being as a democratic bourgeois republic
8302076 whilst in ordinary life every shopkeeper is very well able to distinguish between what somebody professes to be and what he really is our historians have not yet won even this trivial insight they take every epoch at its word and believe that everything it says and imagines about itself
8302077 this historical method which reigned in germany and especially the reason why must be understood from its connection with the illusion of ideologists in general e g the illusions of the jurist politicians of the practical statesmen among them too from the dogmatic dreaming and distortions of these fellows this is explained perfectly easily from their practical position in life their job and the division of labour
8302078 it is utterly impossible to seek the causes for the recurrences of capitalist society in the subjective consciousness in the intentions or plans of its members
8302079 for economic science the decisive significance is what and how people do not what they themselves think about their actions at the base of society is not religion and morality but nature and labour marxs method is materialistic because it proceeds from existence to consciousness not the other way around marxs method is dialectic because it regards both nature and society as they evolve and evolution itself as the constant struggle of conflicting forces
8302080 where the proletariat for the first time held political power for two whole months this programme has in some details been antiquated one thing especially was proved by the commune viz that the working class cannot simply lay hold of ready made state machinery and wield it for its own purposes
8302081 science does not reach its goal in the hermetically sealed study of the scholar but in flesh and blood society
8302082 in a rough sketch of national organization which the commune had no time to develop it states clearly that the commune was to be the political form of even the smallest country hamlet and that in the rural districts the standing army was to be replaced by a national militia with an extremely short term of service the rural communities of every district were to administer their common affairs by an assembly of delegates in the central town and these district assemblies were again to send deputies to the national delegation in paris each delegate to be at any time revocable and bound by the mandat imperatif formal instructions of his constituents the few but important functions which would still remain for a central government were not to be suppressed as has been intentionally misstated but were to be discharged by communal and thereafter responsible agents
8302083 i am a socialist of the new era of the 21st century and we are saying that the world should revise the christian socialist thesis if christ lived here he would be a socialist and simon bolivar would go straight to socialism
8302084 when i was released from prison in 1994 and began my political life i naively took as a reference point tony blairs proposal for a third way between capitalism and socialism capitalism with a human face not anymore after seeing the failure of washington backed capitalist reforms in latin america i no longer think a third way is possible capitalism is the way of the devil and exploitation of the kind of misery and inequality that destroys social values if you really look at things through the eyes of jesus christ who i think was the first socialist only socialism can really create a genuine society
8302085 the reference of ch vez to jesus as the first socialist is applicable from the ethical plane of the reforming praxis of the nazarene and the social coexistences las convivencias sociales of the first christian communities that is to say from the third and fourth level of human existence anthropological
8302086 the first communities were called ekklesia taking over the terminology and the praxis how heinz loves this word of the popular assemblies of the political system of athens which was the first participative democracy in a class society in the west governed by a combination of electoral and lottery systems by lots a participative democracy that nevertheless was not universal but elitist because it excluded women manual workers slaves and freedmen
8302087 this advance of participative democracy in the church of the catacombs which was later lost when it became converted into the imperial church is repeated in the individual praxis of jesus the ethic of solidarity respect for others compassion for the poor for the excluded for those who are discriminated against and the equality of human rights and practical opportunities in life which the nazarene preached and practiced was without doubt a progressive and antisystemic element in the repressive tribal male chauvinist environment of roman dominated palestine
8302088 and similar empty moralistic claptrap that serves as a cover for their subservience to the rich and powerful and their cowardly acceptance of the status quo
8302089 the law in its majesty makes no distinction between rich and poor both are forbidden to sleep under the bridges of paris
8302090 the rethinking retirement study revealed a range of perspectives from hope and excitement to confusion and concern on how americans are shifting the way they define and want to experience their retirement years
8302091 retirement in america is no longer a period of winding down and looking back on life americans are pushing back on what it means to be old survey responses indicate the generations are ready to continue working and actually eager to walk down an entirely new career path
8302092 retirement is no longer taking a back seat to other stages in life
8302093 the bottom line is people are living longer our retirement years are almost as long as our working life and many of us especially those within the boomer generation are very much aware of their abilities and are remaining more active and engaged in this stage of their lives than any other generation before them
8302094 boomers are at the tipping point of the retirement boom
8302095 this leads to questions about how we as a community will manage this new emergence of retirees and whether as individuals we are prepared without a doubt the notion of what it means to retire is changing as people think differently about what they want to make of their next phase of life it seems clear from the study that while everyone wants a break from work and most would prefer a better balance between work and leisure decades of disengaged leisure is not what people want nor can they ultimately afford it
8302096 from the way we view our careers to how we define what retirement will look like people at every stage of life are looking for help to achieve financial security in their later years financial services firms have an important role to play in supporting a lifelong commitment to financial fitness and making available the education resources and encouragement to help achieve it

8302125 i actually think its inevitable twenty20 cricket will be an olympic sport
8302126 you think about the audiences in the sub continent 22 or 23 per cent of the worlds population is based in that area
8302127 the ioc could do a lot worse than put cricket into the olympics
8302128 the critical issue with the game of twenty20 cricket is how do we make it work
8302129 the reason i say that is not because i want to go off and play its not about that
8302130 i want to play for australia as much as i can i want to play as many tests for australia as i can
8302131 i want the next generation of australian players to have that dream to put on the baggy green cap and play 100 test matches and 300 one day games
8302132 im worried if theres not that period of time be it in the ipl or the epl or whatever competition it might be that this next generations opinions might change
8302133 they might see the dollars and think maybe its more appealing to me that i go and play ipl instead of playing for my country

8302144 the lack of government response is alarming to say the least the national government of india must step up to the plate and get orissa officials like shri naveen patnaik to act

8302252 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a new cold war
8302253 russia is a state which has to ensure its interests along the whole length of its border this is absolutely clear
8302254 there is no blockade any ship can get in american and others are bringing in humanitarian cargoes and what the americans call humanitarian cargoes of course they are bringing in weapons
8302255 russias actions in recent weeks call into question russias commitment to peace and stability in the caucasus
8302256 i dont think we should be afraid of isolation i dont believe isolation is looming
8302257 russias actions are an attempt to militarily annex a sovereign nation in direct violation of international law
8302258 the russian federation is seeking to validate the use of violence direct military aggression and ethnic cleansing to forcibly change the borders of a neighbouring state
8302259 this is not an easy choice to make but it represents the only possibility to save human lives
8302260 saakashvili opted for genocide to accomplish his political objectives by doing so he himself dashed all the hopes for the peaceful coexistence of ossetians abkhazians and georgians in a single state

8302270 with regard to my estranged family who were never there for myself or my children but always there for their distorted version of catholicism i give and bequeath the sum of 1 each to my

8302272 and cast over the side of a vessel into the ocean where my body may rest undisturbed by any person s in the deep
8302273 although i recognize that this request may very well violate certain laws of the state of new york and federal as well as multiple other jurisdictions i trust that my executor and friends will ignore same
8302274 this gift is conditioned upon each of them not telling their respective wives of said gift so they may not get their hands on same
8302275 in the event my friends brothers fail to provide me with a burial befitting my character then and in that event i curse each one of them as follows

8302345 at the same time data is looking like the housing market is near a bottom
8302346 still it will become increasingly difficult for policy makers to ignore the gse situation as risks of further contraction in the mortgage market are as unpalatable as a high profile bailout

8302351 in order to keep the costs low for the pilot projects we actually tried to look for places which have a good mix of private housing hdb housing and some small shops such that we can get enough volunteers to take part and get a good mix

8302355 based on the demographics it seems likely that they leave to start families is that what happens
8302356 they talk about demeaning and condescending attitudes lots of off color jokes sexual innuendo arrogance colleagues particularly in the tech culture who genuinely think women dont have what it takes who see them as genetically inferior its hard to take as a steady stream its predatory and demeaning its distressing to find this kind of data in 2008
8302357 she made a point that she was queen of the far left which was the group that really helped obama get to where he was

8302366 we are in a privileged position in spain and we have taken a great step forward
8302367 we have brought together over 100 000 people at the circuit
8302368 i am very happy because we have proved that there is a project for the future although we still need to deal with some details but all the comments we have received by the professionals working in f1 are positive
8302369 we have to improve some small matters details such as some of the kerbs and surrounding areas and it is obvious that for next year we want to improve over this year but we are still very satisfied
8302370 for example there have not been any problems with access points in spite of the large number spectators that have come to the grand prix

8302374 through the partnership with fis zaugg will receive the confirmation that the riders in general and the professional riders in particular highly value perfectly designed and shaped pipe and park infrastructures
8302375 of course that could change quickly if amazon throws their muscle behind shelfari and integrates it into their overall service
8302376 companies with dominant share tend to get more dominant over time
8302377 what if all the other social networks dedicated to books banded together and let their users communicate with each other over the fence as it were
8302378 it sets us apart from all other advertising out there
8302379 snow resort creative advertising is typically limited to a blue sky white snow big smile repeat formula whereas our executive team is much more progressive in supporting cause oriented aspen snowmass campaigns
8302380 we are a values driven company and have a different operating philosophy than every other major resort in north america

8302398 he has come through the ranks at west ham and maybe just needs a change
8302399 it was hard leaving west ham because i have been there for 16 years but after meeting roy keane i knew it was time for a change
8302400 this is a great challenge for me and i feel it is an exciting time at sunderland i think the move will do me good

8302402 were working hard to come up with a compromise which we think is doable
8302403 the secretariat of g33 is working hard right now as we speak there will be probably beginning next week the beginning of informal discussions between senior officials to find the technical compromise
8302404 that this is not being abused that theres discipline to using it
8302405 ensure that the political commitment and will to resume negotiations comes from the highest level
8302406 when you have an economic slowdown as is being predicted in the us as well as europe and japan then this is often the time when you have unilateral protectionism we certainly would be very concerned about that
8302407 the answer to that is to ensure that the multilateral trading system is preserved and that means again prioritising at the highest level of political commitment to resume negotiations as soon as possible
8302408 the contract that we have with all karaoke operators states clearly that we do not include any musical works as long as you use any music repertoire represented by us for the record labels they are supposed to regularise the license
8302409 only recently theyve asked us to collect because theyve been unable to collect because these karaoke operators and suppliers ignored them or turned them away so they asked compass to administer it for them
8302410 its inevitable because i was somehow expecting this to come looking at the previous license that were paying to rips and compass
8302411 i hope that compass and innoform can have a very amicable and transparent paying structure so that it will not affect our competitiveness in the future but of course if we dont pay this we might not have new songs to compete against other operators
8302412 the night was terrifying and difficult i thank the libyan authorities for their efforts which allowed us to be freed
8302413 the two hijackers and the seven crew are still inside we are continuing to negotiate with them

8302419 building an organisation of people who believe in the brand
8302420 to ensure that employees grow to feel for value trust and have regard for the brand is a more complex challenge for brand builders
8302421 tomorrows brand builders will need to fully consider the underlying parameters that define a brand culture while effective internal brand strategy tools and communications can be designed and implemented to create understanding of the concept of brand and convey the intent of the brand promise it may still be critically short of creating and building an organisation of emotionally connected people who believe in the brand
8302422 flowing from this exploratory research it seems self evident that employees belief in the company or organisational brand depends on the leadership management and performance of the business
8302423 therefore to build an organisation of people who believe in the brand and coherently deliver its promise internal brand building must be integral to business and brand strategy

8302442 while a lot of towns have suffered some economic setbacks recently we have not
8302443 we didnt become the crossroads of the oil industry by any great design
8302444 it wasnt that a bunch of guys got together and said they were going to build an oil system and put cushing at the centre it just evolved

8302473 a particular programme rooted in one culture and thus attractive in that environment will have a diminished appeal elsewhere as viewers find it difficult to identify with the style values beliefs institutions and behavioural patterns of the material in question included in the cultural discount are reductions in appreciation due to dubbing or subtitling the biggest media products that the japanese have managed to export despite cultural discount is manga and anime but is this due to american cultural influences shaping the genre into a more western friendly medium case study 1 alakazam the great saiyu ki the first example of a japanese animation that has been influenced by american culture is the 1960 feature the enchanted monkey saiyu ki directed by daisaku shirakawa taiji yabushita and osamu tezuka for toei studios it was released in america as alakazam the great in an attempt to win a bigger audience by moving away from the emphasis of the ancient eastern tale the story is a retelling of part of the epic chinese classic the journey to the west xiyouji written by wu cheng en in the sixteenth century the title name change and the subsequent character name changes point to the influence that america held over japanese culture at the time the original story chronicles the many encounters of sanzo a monk who travels from china to india to obtain a copy of the original buddhist scriptures to bring back to his country and teach the purity of siddhartas original messages in osamu tezukas film the star of the show is not sanzo but son goku the monkey king son guko is a talented but arrogant warrior that is sent on a journey by buddha to learn the virtues of humility and compassion however when re dubbed and released in the united states the characters changed sanzo became prince amat and turns out to be the son of buddha buddha in turn is named king amo sir quigley pigze lulipopo sandy and son goku is renamed the titular alakazam considering the fact that the storyline was centuries old there is more than a passing resemblance between the character of alakazam son guko and the way in which japan was seen by the rest of the world in the tale the protagonist is king of his surroundings japan in the late 1930s and early 1940s before he discovers the existence of a people that are more powerful than him in an attempt to beat them he sneaks into their world and begins a pre emptive strike against them pearl harbour attack he is then disciplined by a greater being america before being allowed to continue his journey under the agreement that he learns from his mistakes the occupation and the subsequent acceptance into the united nations i believe the fact that tezuka decided to use the story to create this the third japanese feature length animation demonstrates an understanding of the ever present american dominance over japan the aesthetics of the production borrow from the american animations of the time in the post war period it was evident that the biggest influence on the explosion of manga style artwork came from the imports of european and american comic books and animation the most famous being the work from the studios of walt disney osamu tezuka was originally a manga artist before he became involved with anime his style and technique was heavily influenced by disney he admitted to watching bambi 80 times and snow white 50 times

8302512 in the end the charges against the duke athletes turned out not to be true but for nearly nine months duke lived with allegations that three student athletes might have raped a student at a nearby university duke focused on its own reputation but missed an opportunity to talk about the larger issue of rape
8302513 sexual violence is a serious matter and organizations that find themselves confronting such charges even charges they suspect may not be true need to speak clearly and strongly to the issue of rape itself
8302514 from this nationally representative telephone survey we estimate that more than 4 3 million u s adults are taking opioids regularly in any given week

8302521 we have clearly shown that berries which contain a variety of anticancer compounds have a genome wide effect on the expression of genes involved in cancer development
8302522 this suggests to us that a mixture of preventative agents which berries provide may more effectively prevent cancer than a single agent that targets only one or a few genes
8302523 freeze drying the berries concentrates these elements about ten times giving us a power pack of chemoprevention agents that can influence the different signaling pathways that are deregulated in cancer
8302524 these changes in gene expression correlated with changes in the tissue that included greater cell proliferation marked inflammation and increased apoptosis
8302525 because both berries and the second agent maintain near normal levels of expression of these 53 genes we believe their early deregulation may be especially important in the development of esophageal cancer
8302526 whats emerging from studies in cancer chemoprevention is that using single compounds alone is not enough
8302527 and berries are not enough we never get 100 percent tumor inhibition with berries so we need to think about another food that we can add to them that will boost the chemopreventive activities of berries alone

8302540 they have had no regard whatsoever to their own guidelines on issues such as the lack of other retail facilities and access to cash services

8302550 it has embraced the ballot box it has created a fair and popular constitution it has avoided civil war iraqs violence has largely become local and criminal the violence while tragic has ceased being political and is therefore no longer nearly as important as it was
8302551 a persons past vote tells you something about his or her judgment obama talked a lot about the clarity of his judgment in opposing the iraq war
8302552 when he voted against the surge in he claimed on more than one occasion that it would lead to increased casualties and it didnt howd he get that one wrong
8302553 in january 2007 obama claimed that the iraqi government would make no hard choices if the united states stayed
8302554 if obama was wrong about the tactical gains that would be made by the new strategy and wrong about how the iraqi political leaders will react can his larger theory about how iraqis will respond to a troop pullout remain intact
8302555 the violence in anbar has gone down despite the surge not because of the surge
8302556 the reality is that neither iraq war can be lost at this point

8302588 we hire six professional coaches all current drivers in the rolex series indycar series or other major series in the program we have 15 customers show up for the day and they basically get to test five supercars we have a ferrari 430 lamborghini porsche 911 turbo aston martin and mercedes clk63 and the customers get to put each of them through their paces by the end of the day theyre driving them at speed all with the help of professional coaches over a one day program
8302589 its enormous so it will be able to support large amounts of grand am fans the facility has brand new state of the art garages theres nothing they didnt think of to hold a big race the infrastructures all there the track is very cool its fast with a lot of interesting corners obviously theres been some thought been put into it and obviously an incredible amount of money it looks like hundreds and hundreds of acres they certainly spared no expense
8302590 most of my experience is on lightning which is the other track
8302591 i did get to coach in the ferrari challenge and get some extra laps at thunderbolt
8302592 thunderbolt is a fast third fourth gear corner type track
8302593 its got a lot of long sweeping corners it should be good from the spectator point of view however i have no idea of what it will be like in a daytona prototype

8302603 the honeybee is the perfect lever especially to reach the youth
8302604 we are greatly encouraged by our findings because the nearly half of the children on the diet were either able to maintain healthy cholesterol or gradually metabolized the extra fat and returned to somewhat normal cholesterol levels
8302605 this means the benefits of the diet a diet that is lifesaving in many children and therapeutic in most of them continue to outweigh the risks
8302606 these new findings have several clinical implications besides the impairment of sexual function in these young men
8302607 the lack of testosterone during these critical years may lead to diminished bone mass and the lack of development or lose of skeletal muscle in addition these patients may gain more weight with an average body mass index of 38 they already were obese and become more insulin resistant
8302608 also patients with low testosterone and type 2 diabetes have been shown to have very high concentrations of c reactive protein
8302609 which increases their risk of developing atherosclerosis and heart disease above and beyond the risk associated with diabetes
8302610 while obesity contributes to the association of type 2 diabetes and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism hh the association is not dependent entirely on obesity
8302611 in our first study of diabetic men we found that 31 percent of lean type 2 diabetics also had hh so it is likely that factors other than obesity contribute to hh possibly insulin resistance
8302612 whether obesity or insulin resistance is the major determinant of hh has to be addressed in future studies and the pathogenesis of hh needs to be defined

8302629 e qui altro che realta virtuale siamo nella mistica delle intenzioni a milano si sa il verde e una perdita di tempo e di denaro la citta dentro i confini amministrativi non quella reale smisurata ben oltre tutta la provincia copre un area relativamente piccola e densamente costruita mancano vere e proprie piazze a milano sentite come tali se si esclude quella del duomo il verde urbano i parchi i luoghi di incontro insomma scarseggiano e sono sempre trattati come spazi residuali poco valorizzati siamo in una citta dove perdere tempo fermarsi non ha letteralmente senso

8302724 whenever this issue is raised some of our friends recoil in horror the negro should be granted equality they agree but should ask for nothing more on the surface this appears reasonable but is not realistic for it is obvious that if a man enters the starting line of a race three hundred years after another man the first would have to perform some incredible feat in order to catch up

8302727 whenever the issue of compensatory treatment for the negro is raised some of our friends recoil in horror the negro should be granted equality they agree but he should ask nothing more on the surface this appears reasonable but it is not realistic

8302734 there is also a strong correlation between iq tests for those who say it doesnt measure anything and the ability to be brilliant in abstract fields like math and physics it must measure something but blacks have among the highest self esteem scores so apparently everyone wants to just keep cheering them on like disabled people at the special olympics enabling them feel better so they wont quit school and commit crimes it is not hard to figure why they give up very early on its bad enough if youre in a white classroom 1 standard deviation 15 points behind on average but then when we start throwing asians in there with mean iqs of 107 the only thing blacks can do is completely and utterly give up
8302735 east asians have high not of 107 but between 103 and 105 jews have the highest despite asians having a slightly higher average than whites the majority of brilliant people are white men teir iqs stray the farthest from average asians and white females tend to saty clost to the average
8302736 if all you know about a doctor is his race the logical choice is to not choose the black doctor if you want a doctor who was successful in medical school
8302737 blacks score low in all aspects of life no matter what part of the world they are from and always have its not skin color its brain size
8302738 but blacks have among the highest self esteem scores so apparently everyone wants to just keep cheering them on like disabled people at the special olympics enabling them feel better so they wont quit school and commit crimes
8302739 despite asians having a slightly higher average than whites the majority of brilliant people are white men

8302742 if black people didnt ask society to lower academic standards in college admissions for black people and if black people got into college by actually meeting the same standards as everyone else people would not think that black people on average are less capable of academic success
8302743 disprove the popular belief that the jew is highly intelligent

8302773 president bush is the greatest president ever because we havent had any terrorist attacks since 9 11
8302774 actually there isnt any evidence that a second terrorist attack was ever attempted so it seems more likely that we havent been attacked again because no one has tried we have no reason to assume that the administration actually stopped any new attacks since 9 11 also there are a lot of other ways to measure the greatness of a president so lack of terrorist attacks proves nothing about the greatness of this one sorry bro
8302775 well 4 out of every 5 people i meet seem to agree with my flawed argument so ill keep trying it even though some people know better because it still convinces everyone else that im right and convincing them that im right is what matters after all

8302798 in lijn met omzet en resultaatniveaus in het vierde kwartaal 2007 en het eerste kwartaal 2008
8302799 in zijn algemeenheid denken we dat de marktomstandigheden niet zullen verbeteren gelet op de economische ontwikkelingen in nederland
8302800 desondanks denken we de opgaande lijn door te zetten in de tweede helft van het jaar
8302801 het is een belangrijk signaal dat de banken de positieve ontwikkeling van super de boer ondersteunen
8302802 en dat we boven verwachting de reorganisatie snel en succesvol hebben afgerond kern van de zaak is dat laurus succesvol gereorganiseerd is
8302803 natuurlijk verwachten wij dat de nederlandse markt zich verder consolideert maar het is niet zinvol om te speculeren op diverse mogelijkheden
8302804 wij vinden het op dit moment heel belangrijk om super de boer sterk op de kaart te zetten na de reorganisatie natuurlijk houden we onze ogen en oren open maar hoe het gaat lopen ligt in de toekomst besloten

8302808 he benji actually helped me write some of the songs for my new album and for the bff show hes a really amazing talent songwriter and singer
8302809 we need a whole new approach and we need to act now
8302810 our research shows that many of the worlds existing no take areas are in the wrong place
8302811 new protected zones are needed that focus on areas identified as escaping or recovering well from climate change impacts but a major focus needs to be shifted towards increasing the resilience of the system as a whole that means reducing as many other locally derived threats as possible
8302812 coral dies when it is put under stress so what we need to be doing is reducing the direct human impact such as over fishing pollution and contact nicholas graham
8302813 by removing all these other stresses we are giving the coral the best chance of surviving and recovering from any changes in temperature that may occur as a result of global warming
8302814 this provides the key to conserving coral reefs in the face of climate change
8302815 we are not suggesting that we scrap the existing ntas in terms of protecting fish stocks they have been quite successful
8302816 but they are not effective against global warming and in order to ensure the long term survival of this rich marine community that is what we need to address
8302817 i think she gave a very good speech from her point of view and our point of view but not necessarily for barack obamas point of view
8302818 the lord is my chosen portion and my cup you hold my lot the lines have fallen for me in pleasant places indeed i have a beautiful inheritance

8302820 this is a very exciting opportunity for writers across the country
8302821 were able to provide workshops and support for your musical no matter where you live were thrilled at the idea of working with musical theatre writers we wouldnt normally get to meet because they dont live in los angeles this is going to be fun
8302822 the middle class is being squeezed so much its almost becoming a working class
8302823 were not talking about the single mothers that people think were talking about two parent families working three and four jobs and are still struggling to make it
8302824 we did things to change our lives and nothing has changed
8302825 things certainly arent getting any better were kind of holding the line
8302826 but there are more people living in poverty than 2000
8302827 were not seeing the growth in the children or families portion
8302828 where we are seeing it is in our poor adult population
8302829 i think they go to the hospital to get their care
8302830 we are seeing a lot of folks in our emergency rooms which is a very expensive setting to receive their care
8302831 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8302832 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8302833 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me

8302836 i saw some of my colleagues standing up and applauding for obama for the first time
8302837 it seems to be a little more of a problem than i anticipated
8302838 all you need is 200 people in that crowd to boo and stuff like that and it will be replayed 900 times and thats not what you want out of this
8302839 this is the next to last step in a systematic succession plan weve had in place for some time now
8302840 but its still an announcement that comes with a lot of mixed emotions when you consider the integral role that bb amp t has played in my life for nearly 40 years now
8302841 im extremely proud of all that weve accomplished and the meaningful impact weve had on the lives of so many clients employees and shareholders
8302842 i will certainly miss my close relationships with so many friends and business associates however for bb amp t and for me personally this is the right time to move forward nearly 20 years is certainly a long time for anyone to serve as ceo
8302843 i was a board member before john became ceo and ive seen firsthand the development of the bank throughout his tenure
8302844 he established and nurtured a corporate culture of the highest integrity his leadership is unique and unprecedented in the financial industry our company has seen profitable growth for more than 20 years
8302845 this is the next to last step in a systematic succession plan weve had in place for some time now
8302846 but its still an announcement that comes with a lot of mixed emotions when you consider the integral role that bb amp t has played in my life for nearly 40 years now
8302847 im extremely proud of all that weve accomplished and the meaningful impact weve had on the lives of so many clients employees and shareholders
8302848 i will certainly miss my close relationships with so many friends and business associates however for bb amp t and for me personally this is the right time to move forward nearly 20 years is certainly a long time for anyone to serve as ceo
8302849 i was a board member before john became ceo and ive seen firsthand the development of the bank throughout his tenure
8302850 he established and nurtured a corporate culture of the highest integrity his leadership is unique and unprecedented in the financial industry our company has seen profitable growth for more than 20 years
8302851 there is no reason to change course our mission service culture operating strategy and values have only been reaffirmed during the current down cycle in the economy bb amp ts best days have always been ahead of us we will continue to execute on our vision of creating the best financial institution possible
8302852 kelly has been involved in every significant strategic decision weve made at bb amp t for over 25 years
8302853 he is a proven leader and firmly committed to bb amp ts culture and vision and the corporate values that have made us successful he will do an outstanding job as ceo
8302854 the board is totally confident in kellys leadership and long term commitment to our company
8302855 kelly knows bb amp t as well as anyone he knows the culture and knows the values and will keep both intact as ceo we are extremely fortunate to have someone with kellys talents and abilities ready to step into this job
8302856 i respect and appreciate the phenomenal job that john allison has done in leading our company the past 20 years
8302857 i have mixed feelings because weve worked so closely together for so many years and ive truly enjoyed our relationship but im also happy for john and his family hes still young and healthy and will have the time now to pursue interests that are very important to him
8302858 our five year plan was about a generational change to systematically add six relatively young yet very tenured leaders to our executive management team
8302859 we have a proven team in place now that will provide the necessary foundation to compete and remain independent in a rapidly changing world

8302861 although it is relatively rare to find the eggs and babies of extinct animals it is even rarer to find them inside the body of the mother
8302862 the turtle specimen was partly broken when it was first discovered it is this fortuitous break that revealed that the fossil was a mother
8302863 based on these fossils we have determined that the ancestor of living hidden necked turtles which are most of todays turtles and tortoises laid a large number of eggs and had hard rigid shells

8302870 de onderliggende kwaliteit van de cijfers is zwakker dan waar ik op rekende omdat veel van de verbetering voortvloeit uit de sterkere prestaties in nigeria
8302871 we verwachten in het tweede halfjaar een verbetering van de marges in centraal en oost europa omdat we dan de stijging van de grondstoffenkosten kunnen doorberekenen
8302872 afgelopen halfjaar konden we alleen in het tweede kwartaal de gestegen grondstoffenkosten doorberekenen waardoor de marges in het eerste halfjaar wat onder druk stonden
8302873 in de westerse markten kunnen we nog voldoende groeien door aan de ene kant de kosten te verlagen en aan de andere kant de marges te verbeteren en het aantal premium merken te verhogen door innovatie
8302874 we worden wel geraakt door het economische klimaat in de verenigde staten maar het verandert de outlook van de hele onderneming niet omdat we in geen enkele markt meer dan 9 tot 10 van de winst halen
8302875 we zijn in tegenstelling tot concurrenten als inbev en sab miller niet in grote mate afhankelijk van een markt

8302884 when you look back historically torontos been a graveyard for young defencemen that maybe shouldnt have been integrated into the nhl lineup as early as they were
8302885 when you look at your top two lines were going to have a lot of young players there this year
8302886 how we fare during the regular season will depend very much on how half a dozen of our young players progress

8302918 what drivers dont realize is that ethanol is one third less energy per gallon
8302919 so if i have a gallon of gas sitting here and a gallon of ethanol im going to get more energy out of a gallon of gas than on a gallon of ethanol
8302920 virtually every car on the road runs on e10 just fine with no problems whatsoever
8302921 you can immediately go to 14 billion gallons of ethanol without having to worry about infrastructure concerns like the cars engine or gas pumps or anything like that
8302922 so if you have a non ffv and you pump it into your vehicle youre going to have a very serious large expense in front of you to the tune of thousands of dollars vehicles that dont run on e85 if you do pump it into those vehicles the problem is it will corrode the fuel lines the tank the fuel pump destroy the fuel filter etc
8302923 if you are comparing performance and that kind of stuff e85 is an extremely high performance fuel and thats why the indy racing league runs exclusively on ethanol
8302924 today ethanol is becoming far more of a viable alternative to gasoline as will other technologies like hybrids and plug in hybrids and all of this other stuff that will come its ethanol that is the first foot in the door
8302925 the energy crisis is this country today is such that we cant afford to take any options off the table biofuels and ethanol in particular offer us a very logical and a very easy first step
8302926 it will put us behind the 8 ball as far as being competitive

8302930 la g n ralisation du rsa soit prise en charge par une diminution de la ppe prime pour lemploi
8302931 il y a quand m me plus de l gitimit financer les revenus des plus modestes par une contribution des plus riches sil doit y avoir des financements pour le rsa quils soient pris sur ceux qui ont le plus me para t l gitime
8302932 hier il voulait prendre sur les b n ficiaires de la ppe aujourdhui sur les revenus du patrimoine quand on aura le dispositif je regarderai ce quil y a lieu de faire mais je trouve quil y a quand m me plus de l gitimit financer les revenus des plus modestes par une contribution des plus riches sur le plan du changement de la mobilit et de la capacit renier ses engagements il est le meilleur dentre nous
8302933 une bonne mesure parce quelle vise sortir les gens de lassistance
8302934 dans le montant consid rable des d penses sociales fran aises si nous avions fait le m nage il est probable que nous aurions pu en interne trouver les ressources n cessaires pour le financer
8302935 augmenter les imp ts sur le capital alors quon a baiss il y a un an les droits de succession jai besoin de quelques minutes pour comprendre
8302936 un des engagements de nicolas sarkozy et de toute la majorit cest de revaloriser le pouvoir dachat des fran ais et de remettre ceux qui taient dans lassistanat au travail le rsa pr sente lavantage de contribuer ces deux objectifs
8302937 pas choqu que les fran ais qui ont le plus b n fici de la revalorisation de 5 du pouvoir dachat entre 2002 et 2007 participent en partie au financement de ce dispositif
8302938 cest lassurance de l quit et de la justice car souligne t il il y a deux types de personnes inactives celles qui vivent uniquement de lassistance et qui co tent tr s cher aux fran ais moyens et celles qui vivent exclusivement des revenus financiers ou du patrimoine il faut r quilibrer tout a
8302939 ce nest pas contradictoire avec la promesse de sarkozy de baisser les imp ts puisque les pr l vements obligatoires ont baiss depuis un an d clare t il au point
8302940 lobjectif est videmment de ne pas augmenter la pression fiscale sur les fran ais mais vous ne pouvez pas vous interdire de toucher aux diff rents instruments fiscaux
8302941 la moins mauvaise solution compte tenu des contraintes actuelles car la taxation est limit e certains revenus du capital et un pourcentage faible
8302942 on ne peut pas hurler quand on fait une baisse dimp ts de 11 milliards deuros et critiquer quand on augmente un peu les pr l vements je ne dis pas que je men r jouis pr cise jean fran ois cop lavenir il faudra trouver dautres modes de financement
8302943 une taxe en plus cest des entreprises en difficult voire en d p t de bilan en plus
8302944 et si on se disait quon pouvait faire ce programme sans faire une taxe nouvelle je crois que cest possible vous prenez toutes les d penses que vous avez d j et les ressources financi res que vous avez et vous regardez est ce que je dois maintenir cette d pense l est ce quil ny a pas un tri dabord faire

8303058 with the rise of many unofficial number plate websites offering drivers celebrity style plates at affordable prices it is important that drivers realise that purchasing through these mediums could cause far more trouble than they are worth it is vital to do your homework before committing to any investment not least one which could mean an mot failure at the very least if you are caught
8303059 they can absorb fairly significant credit costs between now and the end of this year without having to add additional capital
8303060 theres a pretty good chance they will have to tap the market for additional capital if not end of this year sometime in 2009
8303061 how bad can their credit losses get and how much of that capital do they wind up having to use to absorb additional credit losses
8303062 its become pretty obvious that theyre not going to be able to grow going forward
8303063 without a capital raise youre not going to see a major recovery in

8303077 i am comfortable with the current policy i believe we need to give the second half of 2008 a little time to see if the scenario that i personally am counting on plays out more or less according to plan
8303078 many markets continue to be strained it seems to me that we have to continue to be very vigilant about the status of the financial markets and their potential negative impact on the general economy
8303079 the banking system is experiencing a lot of strain and some banks are in very difficult circumstances we continue to monitor banks in this particular part of the country and a number of them are facing liquidity strains and asset quality strains
8303080 with weak growth and financial market strains i believe the most likely outcome is that both headline and core inflation will diminish over the rest of 2008 and into next year as the temporary effects of energy and food price increases abate
8303081 i think the stabilization of the dollar which we hope will hold the stabilization has helped and the inter play between the dollar and commodity prices might also have an influence on the dampening of those pressures
8303082 the almost 30 drop in oil prices has certainly helped and we believe it will play through to the headline inflation number in the second half of 2008
8303083 if overall prices do not moderate in the near term as i expect inflation expectations could become unmoored
8303084 inflation expectations may have risen modestly but not by a material degree
8303085 let me emphasize that i am mindful of todays elevated risks and am prepared at any point to change tactics to ensure inflation expectations do not become unanchored

8303131 21 not every one that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven 22 many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works 23 and then will i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity

8303133 no amount of scientific discovery can strip me of what it means to be human

8303135 the ability to have spiritual experiences needs to contribute to the success of the species if it is to be perpetuated through evolution while a deity may not be the only explanation it certainly seems that i am at a loss for any other logical reasons for this development

8303140 i think the more you do to verify the accuracy of your vote the better off we all are
8303141 no such audit was performed nor do we feel one is or was necessary
8303142 the machines have worked extremely well for west virginia elections with our stringent testing measures required by law along with our security policy west virginia voters will receive a fair and clean election
8303143 if our office and the county clerks did not feel that the machines were reliable we absolutely would not use them in elections
8303144 i think the more you do to verify the accuracy of your vote the better off we all are
8303145 no such audit was performed nor do we feel one is or was necessary
8303146 the machines have worked extremely well for west virginia elections with our stringent testing measures required by law along with our security policy west virginia voters will receive a fair and clean election
8303147 if our office and the county clerks did not feel that the machines were reliable we absolutely would not use them in elections
8303148 as i understand it there was an outcry against going back to the paper and the county commission never took it up
8303149 the one thing you have to realize is to say a cars unsafe is the same as saying touch screens
8303150 the system we have by and large we dont have to worry about accuracy
8303151 w va counties sticking with touch screen voting despite troubles elsewhere
8303152 the system we have by and large we dont have to worry about accuracy
8303153 i dont care who gets the credit as long as we do the right thing
8303154 we have from time to time talked about various property tax relief measures generally i talk you politely listen and then the proposals die a rather unceremonious death upstairs
8303155 so i write again to offer another suggestion rather than argue about whether this is a legislative or gubernatorial proposal perhaps we can arrive at something upon which we agree and then give the credit to the citizens of wyoming
8303156 mostly what youve got today is good news but i wouldnt say weve turned the corner or anything like that
8303157 we all think we should keep up or do better than the cost of living and ive done that but the last nine months kind of snuck up i just started noticing less money
8303158 its clear that the long period of strong economic growth we were in had a positive impact for most americans
8303159 obviously today were dealing with higher energy prices and the downturn in housing but the economy is showing enough resilience to keep growing in spite of those challenges
8303160 too many of our neighbors are living in poverty too many cant find a job and too many are living without health insurance
8303161 i think what the increase is probably attributable to is increased awareness of the medical error reporting requirements
8303162 last year was the first year for the report and a lot the facilities were not really aware of what was reportable and what was not
8303163 it is the mission of methodist hospitals to provide safe quality care to the members of our community
8303164 we were aware of the circumstances regarding these incidents and have implemented processes to ensure that we continue to provide safe quality care to our patients
8303165 we dont see huge gains and in terms of where arkansas position is we still see ourselves lagging the rest of the country enormously
8303166 we have not seen a reversal in our state of the erosion especially of family coverage in the private sector
8303167 a lot of the fall is due to the increase in public coverage
8303168 after an increase in 2006 that had interrupted years of progress in getting more kidscovered
8303169 i think theres a real offset going on with medicaid and other publicly financed programsboth nationally and in terms of arkansas
8303170 its likely that the decrease in coverage statewide would have been worse
8303171 whats interesting is that arkansas does mirror the national trend which is that poverty in 2007 is higher than it was in 2001 which is a surprising outcome at the end of a period of economic growth
8303172 we know things have gotten worse for people during this economic downturn so the fact that even before the economy started souring that poverty rates were so high suggests that now people must be really hurting
8303173 of all the people who are uninsured today less than half will still be uninsured 12 months from now
8303174 theyre kind of de facto insured if they can obtain after the fact care
8303175 i think everybody knows theres a big difference between getting care at the emergency room and getting regular preventive care from a physician theres ample evidence that suggests the quantity and quality of care you get when you dont have insurance is less than when you do
8303176 this is the case that proves that bad things really do happen to good people this has wrecked their lives
8303177 she will in all likelihood have to have that the rest of her life
8303178 there was no deviation of standard care you cannot be 100 percent accurate
8303179 this is the case that proves that bad things really do happen to good people this has wrecked their lives
8303180 she will in all likelihood have to have that the rest of her life
8303181 there was no deviation of standard care you cannot be 100 percent accurate
8303182 i have great respect for doctors i dont take medical malpractice cases lightly
8303183 if somebody wants to file suit i cant do anything about it
8303184 this is the first time ive had this happen were not magicians i feel very sorry about this but we cannot get 100 percent

8303194 it is the prices that makes it harder for families to buy the food they need and their income doesnt go any higher
8303195 you take the seniors on social security and disability it takes more money to get less food
8303196 we are not talking ones and twos but four five six and eight people in a family
8303197 in 2007 the inflation rate for food went up tremendously
8303198 families can afford the rent but then cant afford the food
8303199 the last ones came in for help and we were scrambling to put something in it
8303200 more people are coming in for food because lower income people are having problems with food prices
8303201 its an increase i myself would attribute to fuel and food prices going up
8303202 and today they took with them two bags of food which isnt sufficient

8303209 gods sovereign election is the truth most loathed and reviled by the majority of those claiming to be believers let it be plainly announced that salvation originated not in the will of man but in the will of god see john 1 13 rom 9 16 that were it not so none would or could be saved for as the result of the fall man has lost all desire and will unto that which is good john 5 40 rom 3 11 and that even the elect themselves have to be made willing ps 110 3 and loud will be the cries of indignation raised against such teaching it is at this point the issue is drawn merit mongers will not allow the supremacy of the divine will and the impotency unto good of the human will consequently they who are the most bitter in denouncing election by the sovereign pleasure of god are the warmest in crying up the freewill of fallen man

8303238 theres no need for it its over its been over we all knew it but some of us havent given up the ghost yet
8303239 i think youll find overwhelming support for sen obama in this delegation
8303240 everyone should have heard her by now loud and clear that the job going forward is to work for the election of obama
8303241 id like to see the entire delegation support obama it would be a very strong signal
8303242 the campaigns have determined how this is going to work
8303243 i understand that the clinton delegates want to serve their constituents that is what im doing but i dont want this to be a hollow victory for obama
8303244 i think its part of the healing process i think after tonights vote were going to be a united party and support obama a divided party will never win
8303245 we know there are delegates loyal to clinton its ok its part of the process

8303572 the first one was definitely unexpected and a bit of shock
8303573 in 03 i think it all came a bit too soon when we came out of the end of the year and we had won a championship i dont think we knew what wed actually achieved and now knowing what goes into it and the rewards that go to the guys and everybody who helps thats the biggest part of it
8303574 if we do win a championship it would mean a ton more than 03 i think
8303575 the drought seasons in 04 and 05 definitely make you respect things a lot more feel gifted in that you have the opportunity
8303576 so anytime you even win a race you thrive on it a little more
8303577 i think you definitely get recognized a lot more especially in indy which is where i live
8303578 theres such a history there and people love that race and i probably get a little more respect too
8303579 i think if helio wins the next two races we just have to place fourth so we should be able to do that
8303580 we just have to stay behind him were ok we have a long way to go yet
8303581 i guess we just need to shrug it off and come back strong next week
8303582 we just need to keep doing what weve been doing all year and well be fine
8303583 in terms of this season i think everything that hes done and weve had success together in the past is the result of all of those years of working hard day by day
8303584 its not something that just fell into place its his experience level all the things that hes managed to gather up in his data bank of experience is paying large dividends
8303585 with his ability to adapt his driving style to the racetracks that we have today in this series hes at the right place at the right time with the right team i think we were on the edge of it last year and i think his experience the whole last year was just at the point where it was starting to work well but this year scotts really been able to capitalize on that
8303586 its the same people and theyre obviously doing the same things that they were and maybe its a combination of all the small things have probably come through a little better
8303587 last year we were decent i think we just werent aggressive enough in the first part of the season and thats where we lost a lot of it and had to try and pull it back with six races to go
8303588 i think this season we started strong any season you win a indy 500 definitely gives you a lot of confidence and a lot of motivation for the rest of the year but i also think everybodys just been nailing it the engineering has been extremely good the pit stops have been fantastic where we have struggled a little bit weve mostly been able to come out with pretty good finishes
8303589 my prayer is not for them 12 disciples alone i pray also for those who will believe in me through their message that all of them may be one father just as you are in me and i am in you may they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me

8303625 human life is sacred because from the beginning it involves the creative action of god gospel of life par 53 the direct and voluntary killing of an innocent human being abortion and euthanasia is always gravely immoral gospel of life par 57 65 protecting the mothers health does not justify the deliberate killing of an innocent human being gospel of life par 58
8303626 catholics would be guilty of formal cooperation in evil and so unworthy to present themselves for holy communion if they were to deliberately vote for a candidate precisely because of the candidates permissive stance on abortion or euthanasia

8303666 timely access of primary care is an issue throughout the country we are trying to do what we can to get the right care at the right time to the right person
8303667 its a challenging time right now and i expect it will remain challenging for a while but we are right around the corner from positive change and we cant lose sight of that there have been years and years of difficulty in health care delivery here but i am confident that the right thing is going to be done and it will be done soon
8303668 what we want at the end of the day is consistency we want to get to the point where we have a staff component that people can count on im very much encouraged that key people in the department of health are very committed to working to have sustainable long term care for people in west prince
8303669 we are at a cross roads in west prince this has been a year of difficulties but positive developments are right around the corner
8303670 weve enjoyed tremendous support from the locums and we have a great relationship with staff at oleary they have helped us and our own medical staff has stepped up to the plate
8303671 we need to see the results very quickly it has to be something to balance something that will address the challenges now and provide a bridge to where we will be going

8303675 maybe he feels like hes done enough thats all i can imagine
8303676 i think its going to be a tricky decision that nick faces
8303677 just reading between the lines he poulter is certainly very well placed in terms of world rankings 23rd against caseys 35th colin montgomeries 91st and the open is still relatively recent in my opinion but i havent spoken to him this week and ill be quite interested obviously to hear what his thoughts are

8303680 its made a fluid entry and quickly become part of the tennis landscape there has not been one iota of drawback not from players tournament officials or fans
8303681 i think baseball will like it anything to help get the calls right
8303682 ive heard people say that tennis set the standard for the introduction of replay not just the quality but how it was done we didnt rush it we put it through its paces
8303683 we made sure the players had confidence in it we knew that if we didnt do that and then it failed it would be years before we could try it again
8303684 you can make all the right calls you want but if the players dont have confidence in it its a recipe for disaster
8303685 i think it will work great in baseball it will add to the enjoyment of the spectators
8303686 football does it basketball too why not in baseball the tradition
8303687 the first one was definitely unexpected and a bit of shock
8303688 in 03 i think it all came a bit too soon when we came out of the end of the year and we had won a championship i dont think we knew what wed actually achieved and now knowing what goes into it and the rewards that go to the guys and everybody who helps thats the biggest part of it
8303689 if we do win a championship it would mean a ton more than 03 i think
8303690 the drought seasons in 04 and 05 definitely make you respect things a lot more feel gifted in that you have the opportunity
8303691 so anytime you even win a race you thrive on it a little more
8303692 i think you definitely get recognized a lot more especially in indy which is where i live
8303693 theres such a history there and people love that race and i probably get a little more respect too
8303694 i think if helio wins the next two races we just have to place fourth so we should be able to do that
8303695 we just have to stay behind him were ok we have a long way to go yet
8303696 i guess we just need to shrug it off and come back strong next week
8303697 we just need to keep doing what weve been doing all year and well be fine
8303698 in terms of this season i think everything that hes done and weve had success together in the past is the result of all of those years of working hard day by day
8303699 its not something that just fell into place its his experience level all the things that hes managed to gather up in his data bank of experience is paying large dividends
8303700 with his ability to adapt his driving style to the racetracks that we have today in this series hes at the right place at the right time with the right team i think we were on the edge of it last year and i think his experience the whole last year was just at the point where it was starting to work well but this year scotts really been able to capitalize on that
8303701 its the same people and theyre obviously doing the same things that they were and maybe its a combination of all the small things have probably come through a little better
8303702 last year we were decent i think we just werent aggressive enough in the first part of the season and thats where we lost a lot of it and had to try and pull it back with six races to go
8303703 i think this season we started strong any season you win a indy 500 definitely gives you a lot of confidence and a lot of motivation for the rest of the year but i also think everybodys just been nailing it the engineering has been extremely good the pit stops have been fantastic where we have struggled a little bit weve mostly been able to come out with pretty good finishes

8303792 there are ominous signs that the earths weather patterns have begun to change dramatically and that these changes may portend a drastic decline in food production with serious political implications for just about every nation on earth
8303793 a major climatic change would force economic and social adjustments on a worldwide scale

8303829 those from the early cretaceous period are much less common and one of this size is vary rare so we are able to advance our knowledge of the group in this period

8303862 improved methods to detect molecules have been demonstrated and more people need to be using these methods to detect molecules given off from cancer we have developed laser based methods to detect molecules mid infrared lasers can measure suspected cancer biomarkers ethane formaldehyde and acetaldehyde
8303863 you often have to go outside your discipline to pioneer new areas of research and oklahoma has an advantage with so many experts in other fields but getting funding for interdisciplinary research is challenging however more capital and research infrastructure are needed for this device to become a reality as we build upon our existing capabilities oklahoma can become more widely known as a center of excellence in this important area

8303865 this study highlights the need for congress to revisit the way dietary supplements are regulated in the u s
8303866 our first priority must be the safety of the public herbs and supplements with high levels of lead mercury and arsenic should not be available for sale on the internet or elsewhere
8303867 we suggest strictly enforced government mandated daily dose limits for toxic metals in all dietary supplements and requirements that all manufacturers demonstrate compliance through independent third party testing

8303882 bigger establishments maybe have the ability to hire better quality control staff that can be on staff to check whats going on and they also have some pretty incredible refrigeration systems that allow them to quickly cool the meat which does extend its shelf life
8303883 i think that consumers some anyway are saying now look were ready to pay higher prices if we can have something thats of better nutritional value and actually tastes like something

8303893 i think it will look pretty much as it does now but the key difference will be that afghan institutions afghan army and police and government will actually be in charge and in the lead in building from what we helped them build together over the last few years
8303894 we have to continue to do what weve been doing which is build up the afghan national security forces provide basic humanitarian assistance and to work on border security

8303897 did you see that rudy guy his shooting and his dunk
8303898 could we get his rights from portland can you imagine him in our backcourt with a premier pg helping spread the court for our big men
8303899 too bad oh well hed probably mess up our cap situation we dont want to pay too much luxury tax
8303900 actually hes only a 24 pick on rookie scale for the next four years the cost would be very low
8303901 thats not fair with all the money paul allen has
8303902 actually a year ago his rights could have been had for only 3 million allen put up the money and there you go
8303903 only 3 million for the rights to a guy like that why did they sell to portland of all teams why didnt we do that deal instead
8303904 we did do that deal mr sarver we did do that deal
8303905 man are you ok snap out of it whats wrong
8303906 now i know mr bird now i know why portland traded me away
8303907 it was a great year but if we are going to build on it and continue we need depth
8303908 fernandez wouldnt take much cap space you saw what he can do imagine him coming off our bench
8303909 but we cant get him portland owns him and they arent trading
8303910 but mr ainge a year ago phoenix would have gladly sold his rights to a struggling eastern team rather than a rising western opponent why didnt you buy him then
8303911 portlands stacked theyll be stacked forever if were lucky we win it this year and then they dominate until long after i retire
8303912 thats why im calling i could opt out next year i want championships lots of them theyve got cap space lots of it i could be a free agent
8303913 theyve got roy and fernandez at the 2 it wouldnt work
8303914 i can play the 3 everyone knows i can it will work call them
8303915 i cant talk to them until you are a free agent you have to opt out first
8303916 its just a possible scenario suppose i represented a superstar on a team to the south suppose he saw how your new guy played and all the phenomenal young talent you have and he wanted to win lots of championships now he plays shooting guard but really he could play small forward suppose he told me hed love to go play small forward on a championship team now suppose he knew that you have lots of cap space next year and he was thinking about opting out of his contract next year because of that what would you think about that type of situation
8303917 you asked this to be confidential but this kind of conversation really would involve nate tom penn and especially mr allen you dont mind if i conference them in do you
8303918 hi kobe they really appreciated the idea i could hear it in their voices but paul allen knows hes going to have to give max contracts to 3 players maybe even four counting rudy and he doesnt want to take on another one and they wouldnt think of insulting you by offering less sorry
8303919 hi coach welcome home and congratulations what a great game
8303920 coach we need to talk weve got to be able to get rudy on the court
8303921 i know brandon he brought the ball up some even against pressure perhaps hell play some point
8303922 coach i can defend small forwards i know i can
8303923 well do some of that too brandon im sure we will
8303924 coach were going to be good really good really really really good
8303925 mr stern its a petition signed by 12 western conference owners
8303926 they are petitioning the eu to investigate the portland trailblazers since they have several european players now
8303927 how am i going to spin my way out of this one dips around vs straight ahead at you was i an idiot to type that or what
8303928 jerryd likes to score off of the dribble rudy can catch and shoot
8303929 ok ok i didnt say rudy cant score off the dribble i just said that he can catch and shoot
8303930 jerryd is aggressive rudy is sneaky jerryd will hit you hard rudy will annoy you until you hit him
8303931 howard did hit him though and he was probably annoyed oh well
8303932 need some more offensive flow you go with rudy fourth quarter is here and the team isnt getting to the cup aggressively enough hello jerryd
8303933 yeah rudy is not the guy to go aggressively enough to the cup what am i going to do
8303934 for now i dont think nate will have a lot of trouble figuring out which one to call in a given situation
8303935 youre down there in your pajamas again in the middle of the night why dont you go to bed
8303936 actually hes only a 24 pick on rookie scale for the next four years the cost would be very low
8303937 coach were going to be good really good really really really good

8304008 it was clear to me that they did not have an adequate knowledge of the various powers of when a warrant was required and of the circumstances in which they could act without one

8304153 is a models individual weather correlated to the weather in the real world given the assumptions of the model and no input of actual weather data
8304154 is it not possible that a large portion of the current warming trend is a product of internal climate variability
8304155 how it is you decide that ghgs are responsible for a deterministic forced trend
8304156 why is the itcz at other latitudes generally displaced northward
8304157 with the greatest warming in the tropics generally being in the mid to upper troposphere does that mean the level of non divergence in the hadley cell will rise
8304158 in summary our results imply that the first step in a time series long correlation study should be the separation of the deterministic components from the stochastic ones otherwise wrong conclusions concerning possible memory effects may be drawn
8304159 rescaled range analysis is one of the classical methods used for detecting and quantifying long term dependence in time series
8304160 the ipcc report for instance is very clear in stating that the detection and attribution of climate changes is only clearly possible at continental scales and above
8304161 by correlating at the annual and other short term periods they are effectively comparing the weather in the real world with that in a model
8304162 furthermore by using only one to four grid boxes for their comparisons even the longer term 30 year forced trends are not going to come out of the noise
8304163 seasonal cycle shifts in hydroclimatology over the western united states
8304164 a fundamental and societally relevant conclusion from these studies is that the use of the ipcc model predictions as a basis for policy making is
8304165 the patagonian region neuqu n r o negro la pampa chubut santa cruz and tierra del fuego provinces temperature increase more frequent intense precipitations fluvial valley floods glacier diminution floods wood biomass fires desertification coastal erosion
8304166 for preparing climate change scenarios for argentina the global model hadcm3 uk on ipcc scenarios has been utilized a remarkable trend to decrease of precipitation is also observed for the central region of chile and the argentinean region of cuyo province of neuqu n and the western part of r o negro and chubut these scenarios indicate a continuity of the climatic trends observed during the last decades
8304167 in this study we investigate the weekly to monthly predictability of clouds and precipitation over the lsa east defined roughly by 33 430n latitude and 78 890w longitude
8304168 those irregularities affect weather which over the 30 years of the test becomes climate
8304169 although if i took the time i might be able to justify that view based on some physical arguments maybe
8304170 but dont you think there are some underlying patterns in the global climate that can be understood even with greatly simplified models the hadley cells for example
8304171 lsa east defined roughly by 33 43 degrees n latitude and 78 89 degrees w longitude
8304172 the issue is not developing an understanding it is testing a model the greatly simplified or somewhat simplified models cannot be tested because they do not faithfully simulate particular locations that can be compared to the same real world locations
8304173 42 kevinm im not sure thats a good analogy of what is being compared
8304174 however the earth is not a kettle and albany is not an indistinguishable location it has specific climate characteristics and weather patterns which can be simulated in climate models also the albany discrepancies are repeated for 7 more locations worldwide but is that enough locations to say the model is poor i dont know
8304175 so no number of locations would be enough because ks et al s research question is inapplicable in the first place
8304176 proving a negative is one of the top and common logic fallacies the default is that the cause does not exist until it is proven otherwise
8304177 so no number of locations would be enough because ks et al s research question is inapplicable in the first place
8304178 the number of heads coming up in a run of a particular length
8304179 in a climate model there is a lot of sensitivity to initial conditions and which particular small fluctuations occur in any particular run
8304180 lynn 77 i respect your zeal but asserting things that are prima facie contraindicated in support of your cause is not a good way to build your credibility viz a viz people you may be trying to convince at least in a logical and scientific environment
8304181 if every point in a model is inaccurate how would any aggregate statistic from the model have any validity
8304182 actually you are more interested in the behavior that persists across various initial conditions and in spite of fluctuations you are also interested in the range of behaviors the results of any single run are not that interesting thats why the paper is so baffling
8304183 a total of 1144 data records exist from the three data sources for the region west of the continental divide and south of 54 n of these 824 snow records have 1 april records spanning the time period 1950 97 and are used in most of the analysis for the temporal analysis a larger subset of the 1144 snow courses was used
8304184 data from the nearest five stations are combined into reference time series there is a total of 394 stations with good precipitation data and 443 with good temperature data
8304185 the credibility of the geographically distributed representation of climate by gcms
8304186 with 50 of the electricity coming from coal and with climate change legislation being enacted calling for targets and timetables and so on how do we continue to use our coal resource
8304187 their approach makes no sense unless you want to use gcms for long term weather prediction
8304188 contrariwise if it was so it might be and if it were so it would be but as it isnt it aint thats logic
8304189 take enough runs and you will elucidate the physics of the system
8304190 if you shut your yap and thought maybe youd learn something
8304191 sweep this issue of weather vs climate under the rug
8304192 it is helpful to distinguish forcings that are important in the global mean from those which might be important locally but not have much impact for global warming
8304193 estimating the hurst parameter from observed data is very tricky business
8304194 climate the average of weather over at least a 30 year period note that the climate taken over different periods of time 30 years 1000 years may be different the old saying is climate is what we expect and weather is what we get
8304195 climate change a non random change in climate that is measured over several decades or longer the change may be due to natural or human induced causes
8304196 because global warming isnt just hidden in shorter term weather noise it may have an effect on that weather noise
8304197 its the average of the shape of the distribution of the variations of the shape of the distribution of every variable
8304198 one could comb the universe for similar planets to get more data like an ensemble of model runs
8304199 weve said over and again that short term weather events are difficult to impossible to attribute to climate change
8304200 here was katrina this is what may happen more as the climate warms
8304201 short term weather events are difficult to impossible to attribute to climate change
8304202 social facts not psychological or individual level facts cause social facts
8304203 my plants came up early my pond froze a month late cherry blossoms bloomed a few weeks early
8304204 why doesnt it just keep getting hotter and hotter yadda yadda year s were actually cooler than yadda yadda
8304205 this is real climate and that realisation is not an earthly climate
8304206 was the particular realisation that is the history of the earths climate likely
8304207 how well do the gcms perform at generating suitably high hurst coefficients
8304208 if adding a small lake completely throws off the global average
8304209 how do i know the unforced climate exhibit long term persistence if weve never seen an unforced climate
8304210 in some cases as we will show below semistable oscillations occur in the fluctuation functions consequently there is no scaling and a power law fit is not meaningful
8304211 in some areas in particular in the equatorial pacific biannual cycles occur a feature at variance with observational evidence unfortunately these cycles cannot be eliminated simply by a seasonal detrending analog to equation 1 since the period of 2 years is too unstable for the same reason we were not able to remove the oscillations automatically in the fourier spectrum therefore in order to get rid of these oscillations we additionally consider time series of biannual temperatures i e temperature averaged over 2 years of daily data
8304212 finally in this paper we only studied temperature records and focused exclusively on the linear correlation properties it is an interesting question how far the global climate models are able to reproduce also the nonlinear multifractal features of the climate system see koscielny bunde et al 1998 weber and talkner 2001 govindan et al 2003 ashkenazy et al 2005 bartos and ja nosi 2006 livina et al 2007 it is known that in particular rainfall is significantly multifractal see e g tessier et al 1996 kantelhardt et al 2006 and it will be interesting to see if this feature is also reflected in model rain fall data

8304286 the inspectors that are part of our union have expressed a concern that its simply keeping them too much off the facility floor where they used to actually get a chance to walk around and get a better feel for things
8304287 theyve introduced basically a documentation system that better tracks what activities take place both by the plant and by our members who inspect for the cfia
8304288 the system is supposed to make it more regimented make sure that everything happens in a particular fashion and from that perspective it would be good

8304585 research on identity within the field of psychology should broaden its focus to include a wider unit of analysis than the solitary individual
8304586 such a focus will empower parents and educators to take a more conscious positive and active though careful role in the identity formation of youth while previously such a role may have been understood and portrayed as out of bounds
8304587 we have clearly shown that berries which contain a variety of anticancer compounds have a genome wide effect on the expression of genes involved in cancer development
8304588 this suggests to us that a mixture of preventative agents which berries provide may more effectively prevent cancer than a single agent that targets only one or a few genes
8304589 freeze drying the berries concentrates these elements about ten times giving us a power pack of chemoprevention agents that can influence the different signaling pathways that are deregulated in cancer
8304590 these changes in gene expression correlated with changes in the tissue that included greater cell proliferation marked inflammation and increased apoptosis
8304591 because both berries and the second agent maintain near normal levels of expression of these 53 genes we believe their early deregulation may be especially important in the development of esophageal cancer

8304622 we demand that the state shall make it its primary duty to provide a livelihood for its citizens
8304623 its time to put the common good the national interest ahead of individuals
8304624 our nation can achieve permanent health only from within on the basis of the principle the common interest before self interest
8304625 all individuals or groups are relative only to be conceived in their relation to the state
8304626 its only when you hitch your wagon to something larger than yourself that you realize your true potential
8304627 were going to take things away from you on behalf of the common good
8304628 i am a fan of the social policies that you find in europe
8304629 personal enrichment from war must be regarded as a crime against the nation we demand therefore the ruthless confiscation of all war profits
8304630 the war in iraq makes millions of dollars for big corporations either weapons manufacturers or those working in the reconstruction such as halliburton and its sister companies
8304631 we hope that the great united states of america does not continue to use its enormous resources especially its military might to destroy human life on earth
8304632 i dont oppose all wars what i am opposed to is a dumb war what i am opposed to is a rash war
8304633 the meaning of peace is the absence of opposition to socialism
8304634 we must confront the privileged elite who have destroyed a large part of the world
8304635 there had to be a hysteria and a fear sent through america in order to get increased war budgets

8304640 i hope we will come together as a nation and do whatever it takes to keep guns away from people who have no business with them
8304641 the only way to settle questions of an ideological nature or controversial issues among the people is by the democratic method the method of discussion of criticism of persuasion and education and not by the method of coercion or repression
8304642 we have to build a political consensus and that requires people to give up a little bit of their own turf in order to create this common ground
8304643 we demand the extensive development of insurance for old age
8304644 we need to be as well prepared to defend ourselves against public health dangers as we should be to defend ourselves against any foreign danger
8304645 it requires that everybody be covered it requires that everybody get preventive care
8304646 i had a few ideas about health care and ive learned a few lessons since then but i havent given up the goal
8304647 the aim of the school must be to give the student beginning with the first sign of intelligence a grasp of the notion of the state

8304650 mankind is divided into rich and poor into property owners and exploited and to abstract oneself from this fundamental division and from the antagonism between poor and rich means abstracting oneself from fundamental facts
8304651 capitalists are no more capable of self sacrifice than a man is capable of lifting himself up by his own bootstraps
8304652 we cant just let business as usual go on and that means something has to be taken away from some people
8304653 i am convinced that the path to a new better and possible world is not capitalism the path is socialism
8304654 first ascertain exactly the position of the various capitalists then control them influence them by restricting or enlarging facilitating or hindering their credits and finally it can entirely determine their fate
8304655 its time to send a clear message to what has become the most profitable sector in the entire economy that they are being watched
8304656 the unfettered free market has been the most radically destructive force in american life in the last generation
8304657 there is a serious tendency toward capitalism among the well to do peasants

8304659 passivity is fatal to us our goal is to make the enemy passive
8304660 i will fight against the division politics of revenge and retribution
8304661 political work is the life blood of all economic work
8304662 i am particularly horrified by the use of propaganda and the manipulation of the truth and the revision of history
8304663 you just keep saying something no matter how untrue and unfactual it might be over and over and over again and try to drive the politics to meet your ideological or commercial agenda
8304664 here it comes up again the glorification of one personality this is not good at all i am just like everybody else
8304665 i want to be a champion for the people i have fought for all my life regular people
8304666 my object in life is to dethrone god and destroy capitalism

8304673 we found that when we sent out the take down notice to youtube we found traffic increasing back to our own sites
8304674 we are able to monetize that increased traffic this is high value traffic the premium branded advertisers arent in my opinion going to spend a lot of money for the youtube viewers who are looking at the user generated content of a cat going to the bathroom
8304675 were very interested in virtual worlds but were not technologists so were focusing on our core competencies
8304676 the better hillary does tonight the more everybody in this convention is going to be thinking why didnt barack obama pick her
8304677 this was a message from hillary clinton that basically said i am not your therapist
8304678 i cant believe that there werent at least some people in that hall thinking what if you know what if she was the vice presidential candidate what if she was the presidential candidate it was a wonderful speech i think she did what she had to do
8304679 at the mccain campaign the one thing that we took away and im sure that the pundits will pick apart every word of every speech thats delivered at the convention but the one thing that we couldnt help but miss were the things that she didnt say her largest and most striking criticism of barack obama throughout her primary candidacy was his lack of experience and his failed judgment on foreign policy on key issues that affect working family and she didnt do a whole lot to step away from that criticism and i think what that does is embolden our argument as we more toward election day to make clear to voters that theres a choice between strong leadership in john mccain with a record of reforming washington and theres barack obama
8304680 yes you have four days at the convention you probably should have spent half a day of those four days defining obama and the rest of the time defining the choice between obama and john mccain i think they probably should have had one more hard edged speech last night about john mccain to include that in last nights program
8304681 if you look at what has happened at this convention so far you have a continuing feud between at least bill clinton and obama you have the biden dip it wasnt a biden bounce it was a biden dip mccain has jumped ahead for the first time in the daily tracking by gallup and now you have house speaker nancy pelosi picking a fight on abortion with the catholic bishops thats a loser
8304682 i think they are off to a stronger start faster start putting those women up there in the beginning with those little cameo appearances i think that was very smart leading to the climax with hillary clinton next week the republicans are going to try to tear the hide off barack obama we all see that coming its clear and theyre very good at it there is a reason the republicans have won 7 of the last 10 elections so the question tonight is whether the democrats can come off last night which was reassuring and michelle obama was terrific as was teddy kennedy but they need a battle cry and they need to start raising that tonight and i think one of the challenges for them tonight is this that its unclear what the message is what the theme is the economy to me is one they really have to drive home
8304683 the reviews of your convention speech last night are in mostly positive some glowing how do you think you did
8304684 you know i think it was a solid speech we spent a lot of time preparing but whats interesting is that that speech was really just a more polished version of what ive done on the stump for the last 19 months i really spent this time trying to introduce a broader perspective of who barack is by introducing people to our family and by telling stories and to sharing our life so it was an expanded version of that but thats pretty much what ive been doing for the last year and a half this was a good chance to say this is who we are this is our story and i wouldnt call it a re introduction i would call it the beginning of what will be a very close and competitive general election
8304685 hillary clinton has been nothing but supportive she has been personally supportive to me ive talked to her one on one shes given me advice how to maneuver this process with the girls she called to congratulate me on my speech shes been on the stump asking her funders to move really pushing them to move and shes been in some major swing states campaigning very hard on behalf of barack thats a fact thats been our relationship with hillary since the primaries have been over
8304686 there was some talk coming into this day of the convention that there wasnt enough red meat last night not enough contrast drawn between your husband and john mccain theres some sense that that may be changing tonight theres more of that tonight whats your sense of the right balance
8304687 you know this is a four day convention and you know i think that there is a balance that has to be drawn with you know talking about who the candidate is talking about what barack obama stands for and that tends to be baracks approach to campaigning period particularly in this general election he is less concerned about trying to tear down his opponent and more concerned about laying out and having a real conversation about the issues that people are facing on the ground
8304688 the haute savoie rivals the south of france in its capital growth and high rental yields but the entry prices are high
8304689 more interestingly for first time investors are the off plan products offering rental returns of around five per cent per annum with the possibility of some personal use as well it is often possible to enter this market for around 100 000 79 900
8304690 for any investor looking to upgrade properties i could highly recommend the route of acquiring one bedroom apartments in cities such as lyon toulouse bordeaux and montpellier and upgrading the interior

8304708 zi takes intellectual property rights seriously and has no reason to believe that it infringes any patent claims of nuance this suit in conjunction with the motion of contempt filed by nuance on august 19 2008 against zi represents a questionable course of action by nuance in light of its failed proposal to acquire zi at a low valuation on august 14 2008 the timing of these motions raises serious questions as to the real motivation of these claims and we remain disappointed that nuance is resorting to these tactics to acquire zi without recognizing its full value we will vigorously defend ourselves in this litigation proceeding and continue to examine all legal remedies available to us with respect to nuances tactics
8304709 overall the game plays great the controls work perfectly whether youre an avid baseball fan or a newcomer picking up the game for the first time and if youre a n00b several tutorials are available to help you out only two things hold mario super sluggers back from diamond domination first despite having a terrific control scheme and lots of options its really just another mario licensed sports game if youre looking for something past that try mlb power pros 2008 instead second there are no online options it wouldve been great to form a league with your friends through the wi fi connection but youll have to settle for offline play
8304710 this baseball diamond loses some of its luster with occasionally confusing or clunky play its too easy to accidentally pitch or swing prematurely but the games simplified approach is great for sports curious gamers looking to avoid the complexities of a real simulation

8304751 cest toujours la m me logique on est le pays avec les pr l vements obligatoires les plus lev s de la plan te et les seules id es quon trouve cest de les augmenter encore

8304757 il faut shabituer lid e que a va rester lev car une grande part de ces pr l vements obligatoires concerne les pr l vements sociaux qui financent la s curit sociale notamment les d penses de vieillesse et de sant

8304761 h l mencken was of two minds about the conventions in 1924 he
8304762 the use of advertising to sell statesmen is the ultimate vulgarity
8304763 a lot of people dont realise that biodiesel when made properly will run in any diesel engine
8304764 we wanted to see if its possible to do something with biofuels
8304765 we had a lot of breakdowns en route but we managed to fix everything
8304766 the law exists to protect the young from harm or being exposed to harm in this case both boys were made to take part in the ritual flagellation and suffered injuries to their backs
8304767 we are satisfied that given the age of the children involved the coercion employed by syed mustafa zaidi who did not accept that he was wrong and the possibility of such an incident occurring again the decision to prosecute was the correct one
8304768 if we are working on the basis of our mutual interests then its logical to implement this agreement
8304769 this is an old way of doing things that has nothing to do with modern realities
8304770 primarily i think the u s was looking for things to take away and penalize russia for in georgia

8304773 in a manner that closely approximates our computational algorithm expressing reward expected values
8304774 we conclude that even without conscious processing of contextual cues our brain can learn their reward value and use them to provide a bias on decision making
8304775 this kind of learning had been suggested to be subconscious a century ago on the grounds that it was observed in some species like rats that were supposed to be deprived of conscious awareness
8304776 what drivers dont realize is that ethanol is one third less energy per gallon
8304777 so if i have a gallon of gas sitting here and a gallon of ethanol im going to get more energy out of a gallon of gas than on a gallon of ethanol
8304778 virtually every car on the road runs on e10 just fine with no problems whatsoever
8304779 you can immediately go to 14 billion gallons of ethanol without having to worry about infrastructure concerns like the cars engine or gas pumps or anything like that
8304780 so if you have a non ffv and you pump it into your vehicle youre going to have a very serious large expense in front of you to the tune of thousands of dollars vehicles that dont run on e85 if you do pump it into those vehicles the problem is it will corrode the fuel lines the tank the fuel pump destroy the fuel filter etc
8304781 if you are comparing performance and that kind of stuff e85 is an extremely high performance fuel and thats why the indy racing league runs exclusively on ethanol
8304782 today ethanol is becoming far more of a viable alternative to gasoline as will other technologies like hybrids and plug in hybrids and all of this other stuff that will come its ethanol that is the first foot in the door
8304783 the energy crisis is this country today is such that we cant afford to take any options off the table biofuels and ethanol in particular offer us a very logical and a very easy first step

8304826 our success is going to be largely dependent on our ability to expand globally
8304827 we used to design products for global requirements and distribute the same product globally
8304828 in this situation we started with talking to emerging country customers designing a product for emerging countries and our initial launch of the product is only in emerging countries thats a big departure in our strategy
8304829 these economies are growing so fast that we dont want to miss out on the opportunity
8304830 but if we just use the direct model it might take too long to get there
8304831 we are thrilled that alaskan voters have spoken and they have made it clear that mining is part of our history in the state and part of our future

8304834 data services apply the same philosophy of reuse and flexibility that soa offers but to the data tier

8304837 the development on the out of touch argument is an actually critical development of the campaign
8304838 s ome of the voters images of mccain dont jibe with reality
8304839 we have to be very careful how we approach the swing electorate because they dont have the information about barack obama
8304840 its still way too far out to project a path with any accuracy right now

8304901 a genuine vocation is simply a firm and constant will desirous of serving god in the manner and in the place to which he calls me i do not say this wish should be exempt from all repugnance difficulty or distaste hence a vocation must not be considered false because he who feels himself called to the religious state no longer experiences the same sensible feeling which he had at first and that he even feels a repugnance and such a coldness that he thinks all is lost it is enough that his will persevere in the resolution of not abandoning its first design in order to know whether god wills one to be a religious there is no need to wait till he himself speaks to us or until he sends an angel from heaven to signify his will nor is there any need to have revelations on the subject but the first movement of the inspiration must be responded to and then one need not be troubled if disgust or coldness supervene

8304942 the excellent british science fiction series dr who has been running for sixteen years and it has never yet had a fair go from abc they continue to waste it in ridiculous screening times if inane garbage like space 1999 can command a 7 30pm timeslot then surely dr who can claim the same
8304943 many thanks to atv0 for screening the australian produced adventure series chopper squad it is a great pity the series was removed after a comparatively short period because of low ratings

8304996 home prices are becoming affordable again so the decline in prices is likely more than half over
8304997 many analysts do not expect the financial markets to improve significantly until home prices stop falling the pace of existing home sales remains low and available inventory relatively high both indicating that buyers are not yet able to step into the market at current prices
8304998 however that could change within a year home prices are becoming affordable again so the decline in prices is likely more than half over
8304999 the median home price is now more affordable to the median household than at any time since the start of 2004 my analysis suggests that housing prices will have to fall a bit more but the housing market is not far from being reasonably valued for the first time in five years
8305000 meanwhile rental costs have remained stable and apparently have not had any effect on housing prices independent of household income historically there have been wide swings in the ability of the median household to afford an average house
8305001 in contrast the cost of renting a primary residence has tracked the growth in median household income very closely
8305002 the price appreciation in a hypothetical reit portfolio has followed the same long term trajectory as house prices have during the past fourteen years although reits have been far more volatile from month to month and have had corrections 1997 1999 and 2002 that housing prices did not experience
8305003 apartment reits are actually positive for 2008 that is consistent with the notion that housing prices are near their lows
8305004 the implication of this is that real estate investors should look to get back in for long term holdings

8305128 most parents dont realize what their obese children go through i was obese as a child and i know what it means i did not want my son to suffer the same tribulations of being overweight
8305129 jesse weighed 320 pounds and would have gained 50 to 75 additional pounds in the next six months and that would have affected his health a lot if they waited to get the procedure done in the usa they would have to go through a lengthy process of medical research that would have taken months or even years jesse couldnt afford to wait that long
8305130 they had tried all other means of weight loss including the atkins diet vegan diets weight watchers controlling portion sizes etc with only temporary success the few pounds that were lost were gained back in no time and this could be because jesse may have got the obesity gene from her

8305160 i think clint and i are pretty equal so our team needs to do whatever we can to maintain our place in the standings and capitalize on every opportunity we have to gain points were coming down to the last few races and every point counts every position is one step closer or one step back from the championship
8305161 you want to win every race but you especially want that win in front of the home crowd and with your family and friends cheering you on

8305175 you know to pass a guy to hit him getting into the corners is very tired but thats what he did i had been getting into the corner light all day and i dont know maybe i over braked and drove myself right back into his nose
8305176 lets make it real clear im not apologizing for it
8305177 after much speculation i can confirm that gareth barry will not leave aston villa before the transfer window closes
8305178 gareth made the decision to stay two weeks ago and informed aston villa of his intentions during this time discussions have taken place to decide the best way forward for all parties
8305179 any talks regarding potential new contracts at aston villa will not take place until the end of the season gareth wants to concentrate on playing on the best of his ability for aston villa

8305186 i talk to other people who have done what i did and theyre happy with their decision theyve been able to get their business to the ebay business levels or beyond
8305187 many times you feel like theyre really pushing it to see if youll give them some kind of a refund
8305188 theyll float the suggestion that this isnt exactly what i expected
8305189 when ebay makes these dramatic changes it can make you very nervous

8305206 since multimedia often transcends linguistic barriers we thought it apt to help translate a multimedia player into local languages we chose vlc because it is undoubtedly the most popular open source media player available
8305207 at translate org za we believe that people express themselves best in their own language and people should be encouraged to create multimedia such as podcasts and sound bytes in their native languages
8305208 our way of empowering local languages is to help make popular software in these languages available
8305209 we also make it easier for volunteers by providing a simple web based translation system called pootle which is hosted at pootle locamotion org which makes it easy for anyone to help translate software
8305210 weve split the vlc language file into more workable chunks to make the number of source words more manageable
8305211 organisations such as ours can freely use open source software as a catalyst for creating language communities
8305212 anyone who wants to help translate vlc into their language can make use of our translation system

8305251 i might be biased because this is where i stayed for my bachelorette party but this is a great hotel
8305252 i wonder what sort of place this is would i put my parents up here if they visited i would say yes but not for more than a few days
8305253 thanks to yelp and the sales person at keetsa buying a mattress was surprisingly easy
8305254 its getting worse every day and this government is spinning a line to placate the people of townsville but they are not buying it any more
8305255 theres a limited number of things one can do in the short term
8305256 the master planning process will end in october the tender will go out immediately
8305257 we also looking at any extra bed capacity in the short term current administrative space could be turned into clinical space
8305258 the fact that im up here reflects that townsville is under real pressure
8305259 this financial year we will deliver an additional 11 beds
8305260 on top of that once the master plan is completed in october we will commence the tendering process for the additional 78 beds
8305261 the patients are very sick and its not an ideal situation
8305262 the emergency department is a very undesirable place for people to wait theres lots of light and not much privacy
8305263 our local data suggests its very sick patients who need our care
8305264 so if something did happen my client felt he could defend himself with the rifle butt
8305265 the racial insults were so offensive and so gross they caused you to act in a way you would otherwise never have done
8305266 we had waited a long time to do our trip around australia and it was such a shame to have it ended so quickly by an idiot

8305268 its not an easy decision for him and one that hes obviously wearing a lot of flak for
8305269 he needs to be supported by education queensland and the p amp c which is what were doing
8305270 they may choose at the p amp c meeting to get further advice from people whove got expertise
8305271 i just hope that the administrations pride and ego is not too big that they cant lift the ban and realise that they made a mistake and investigate it properly
8305272 if you do compare it to the other sports the kids are allowed to play its no more risky or dangerous
8305273 enthusiasm for martyrdom persists as long as there is a reasonable chance that it will lead to victory sacrifice must have a purpose
8305274 we are really puzzled to see americans and their followers in the western world think that they are able to confront people who wish to die more than they the americans want to live
8305275 majority of madrasahs actually present an opportunity not a threat
8305276 to establish a just peace not simply the absence of war and to allow non combatants to live free of strife
8305277 they see themselves as exempt from ordinary moral rules because the population they claim to protect is so abused and because god is on their side
8305278 in assuming itself to be above the law the bush administration has made a serious moral error
8305279 the continental us has 95 000 miles of coastline 429 commercial airports with 30 000 daily flights serviced by a fleet of 6 800 us commercial aircraft 200 000 private aircraft 361 commercial seaports and 104 nuclear power plants
8305280 waging physical war against militant jihadis by itself will only enhance their recruitment efforts
8305281 must devise a better way to win the war of ideas involved in the fight against terrorism
8305282 for far too long american counterterrorism planners fbi agents and cia and dod national security defense analysts have taken as their number one priority the task of refining their incident management techniques for combating todays terrorism
8305283 the war on terror label is particularly inappropriate for the conflict in iraq

8305452 at one point the calf was in the wrong place and rose tu gently nudged him with her trunk repositioning her legs so he could get better access for nursing
8305453 she seems especially calm around him and when he nurses it looks like rose is almost sleeping shes so relaxed its a very good sign
8305454 from the behavioral signs weve seen thus far were very hopeful that the reintroduction will be successful
8305455 when we brought the calf in the very first time she tried her best to get to it by breaking chains and breaking chains means she could potentially be free and posed a threat to her calf and the staff
8305456 the production of hydrogen by microorganisms is intimately linked to their cellular processes which must be understood to optimize bioenergy yields
8305457 in general thermophiles have a simpler fermentation pattern compared to lower temperature mesophiles resulting in fewer byproducts
8305458 biological hydrogen production is well suited for decentralized energy production
8305459 the process is performed at almost ambient temperature and pressure and therefore it is expected to be less energy intensive than thermochemical or electrochemical production methods which are alternative ways to get hydrogen
8305460 once we are able to engineer caldi not yet possible we want to further improve its hydrogen producing capacity

8305611 earlier today i was discussing the democratic primary history and in the course of that discussion mentioned the campaigns that both my husband and senator kennedy waged in california in june in 1992 and 1968
8305612 the kennedys have been much on my mind the last days because of senator kennedy and i regret that if my referencing that moment of trauma for our entire nation and particularly for the kennedy family was in any way offensive i certainly had no intention of that whatsoever my view is that we have to look to the past and to our leaders who have inspired us and give us a lot to live up to i am honored to hold senator kennedys seat in the united states senate from the state of new york and have the highest regard for the entire kennedy family thank you
8305613 you know my husband did not wrap up the nomination in 1992 until he won the california primary uh somewhere in the middle of june
8305614 almost immediately some took my comments entirely out of context and interpreted them to mean something completely different and completely unthinkable
8305615 but i was deeply dismayed and disturbed that my comment would be construed in a way that flies in the face of of everything i stand for and everything i am fighting for in this election

8305626 i think thats going to be up to celtic and norwich but obviously im enjoying my time here so far so long may that continue and you never know what is around the corner
8305627 at the end of the day celtic isnt where everything stops
8305628 we were applying pressure we were forcing them into mistakes we werent giving them a lot of time to make decisions with the ball
8305629 the first half i thought we were trying to get some things ironed out
8305630 i thought in the second half we made the changes that were necessary we saw a much better team in the last 20 minutes of the game
8305631 this is his third year playing varsity hes been all over the field
8305632 that will help us on those offsides calls a couple times we didnt talk and we were just passing rather than looking up and looking for things
8305633 weve got a young soccer team but weve got some very experienced soccer players just not enough
8305634 our goal is to improve daily in practice and im seeing things
8305635 we dont talk about size of the school the way we look at it is they put out eleven we put out eleven
8305636 had they been out all four years they would have been tremendous soccer players
8305637 eli did a nice job of containing the middle the problem was we were struggling getting the ball to him
8305638 i thought we played well at goalkeeper i thought our keeper clint slugantz did a nice job coming off a hamstring injury hes a senior that i think can play at the next level
8305639 weve got to come to practice everyday knowing that weve got to work on our ball skills our check runs and maintaining possession
8305640 historical examples of the nominating process going well into the summer and any reading into it beyond that would be inaccurate and outrageous
8305641 primary contests used to last a lot longer we all remember the great tragedy of bobby kennedy being assassinated in june in l a my husband didnt wrap up the nomination in 1992 until june also in california having a primary contest go through june is nothing particularly unusual we will see how it unfolds as we go forward over the next three to four months
8305642 sometimes you gotta calm people down a little bit but if you look at successful presidential campaigns my husband did not get the nomination until june of 1992 i remember tragically when senator kennedy won california near the end of that process
8305643 you know i remember very well what happened in the california primary in 1968 as you know senator kennedy won that primary
8305644 we all remember bobby kennedy was assassinated in june in california
8305645 i was discussing the democratic primary history and in the course of that discussion mentioned the campaigns both my husband and senator kennedy waged california in june in 1992 and 1968
8305646 i was referencing those to make the point that we have had nomination primary contests that go into june thats a historic fact
8305647 the kennedys have been much on my mind the last days because of senator kennedy i regret that if my referencing that moment of trauma for our entire nation particularly for the kennedy family was in any way offensive i certainly had no intention of that whatsoever
8305648 my view is that we have to look to the past and to our leaders who have inspired us and give us a lot to live up to and im honored to hold senator kennedys seat in the united states senate in the state of new york and have the highest regard for the entire kennedy family
8305649 you know my husband did not wrap up the nomination in 1992 until he won the california primary somewhere in the middle of june right we all remember bobby kennedy was assassinated in june in california
8305650 my husband did not wrap up the nomination in 1992 until he won the california primary somewhere in the middle of june right

8305674 you know what rana ji i think its because nepal was never in the commonwealth
8305675 do we have to apologise that weve remained an independent and sovereign state
8305676 during the falkland war the british government said the gurkhas are an integral part of the british army
8305677 yes i remember reading about it it was because the argentinians protested in the uno that the british were deploying mercenary soldiers
8305678 for our bravery and loyalty the queen of england awarded us 6 500 decorations including 13 victoria crosses and two george cross medals but you can t live on medals alone you know mr singh
8305679 if we are equal to the british soldiers and an integral part of the army then why do we have lesser pay than the british soldiers
8305680 you are right why i get the same pay as a white cockney bus driver
8305681 i think you people have no lawyers and politicians behind you

8305695 why dont we plant churches in the city in the urbs and not just the burbs
8305696 our forms and focus of ministry are also shaped by the absolutizing of middle class norms we learn easily that bigger is better so we freeze our church planting efforts into usually suburban settings which promise the largest number given our middle class forms of preaching and worship

8305708 it will be a significant increase on our travel budget
8305709 and its all related to the uil realignment everything is going to cost more money so we have to look at every trip closely were being as wise and frugal as we can be with our expenditures
8305710 ours is not in the millions yet but its close
8305711 lake view makes a lot of long trips as well so that makes it doubly difficult for us its doubled what we accounted for but so far we havent had to make any cuts
8305712 were a member of the uil we support the uil and under the present policy of no fewer than six teams per district in class 5a there was no other choice
8305713 the other option was to move us into el paso or the dallas fort worth area and we probably would have been in worse shape
8305714 everybody wants to blame the uil but they hold the deck and they dealt the cards
8305715 this is an awesome and competitive league and were excited to be a part of it i dont know what the uil could have done differently it is what it is well show up and try to win no matter who and where were playing

8305722 the other option was to move us into el paso or the dallas fort worth area and we probably would have been in worse shape
8305723 everybody wants to blame the uil but they hold the deck and they dealt the cards

8305757 i would like to commend the sullivans and the young doctors in my opinion they are of a very high standard and certainly as good as anything to come from britain or america however the producers of cop shop obviously tries to emulate some of the cheaper dramas from these countries in which men wear shirts too small for them and have their collars wide open this is to let the viewer know that these people are tough to me they look like slobs in a cheap production

8305764 wir haben die sommerpause genutzt um uns optimal auf brands hatch vorzubereiten aber auch um etwas urlaub zu machen und neue energie zu tanken
8305765 ich werde zwar nie so viele autogramme schreiben k nnen wie ich es gerne tun w rde aber ich will es versuchen mir ist es wichtig dazu die chance zu haben denn die unterst tzung der fans f r mich ist unglaublich und so etwas darf man nicht als selbstverst ndlich hinnehmen

8305845 what drivers dont realize is that ethanol is one third less energy per gallon
8305846 so if i have a gallon of gas sitting here and a gallon of ethanol im going to get more energy out of a gallon of gas than on a gallon of ethanol
8305847 virtually every car on the road runs on e10 just fine with no problems whatsoever
8305848 you can immediately go to 14 billion gallons of ethanol without having to worry about infrastructure concerns like the cars engine or gas pumps or anything like that
8305849 so if you have a non ffv and you pump it into your vehicle youre going to have a very serious large expense in front of you to the tune of thousands of dollars vehicles that dont run on e85 if you do pump it into those vehicles the problem is it will corrode the fuel lines the tank the fuel pump destroy the fuel filter etc
8305850 if you are comparing performance and that kind of stuff e85 is an extremely high performance fuel and thats why the indy racing league runs exclusively on ethanol
8305851 today ethanol is becoming far more of a viable alternative to gasoline as will other technologies like hybrids and plug in hybrids and all of this other stuff that will come its ethanol that is the first foot in the door
8305852 the energy crisis is this country today is such that we cant afford to take any options off the table biofuels and ethanol in particular offer us a very logical and a very easy first step

8305926 earlier this week we released a beta of the android sdk in the accompanying post i mentioned that we had to remove some apis from the platform for android 1 0 and as a result they dont appear in the 0 9 beta sdk and wont appear in 1 0 compatible sdks
8305927 we plain ran out of time the android bluetooth api was pretty far along but needs some clean up before we can commit to it for the sdk keep in mind that putting it in the 1 0 sdk would have locked us into that api for years to come
8305928 an android application using gtalkservice would be reachable from all of the users google talk friends and a flaw in that application could pose an inviting target to a malicious friend or automated malware
8305929 im definitely bummed about these api removals i was particularly looking forward to the p2p capabilities offered by gtalkservice but as always user security and privacy must come first

8305937 the contract will provide our community of naval service and marine customers with unprecedented access to esri services
8305938 we previously worked as a subcontractor with several of our partners on seaport e now we can contract directly with seaport e authorized users
8305939 orbit gis 4 3 is flexible and not intimidating to use now gis work is no longer rocket science in addition to our long time vector editing power 4 3 adds raster data processing on an equal professional level this is yet another step in providing valuable alternatives to costly solutions on the market allowing quality solutions for everyone
8305940 orbit gis 4 x users can upgrade at no cost
8305941 we chose arcgis api for flex because it allowed us to leverage the power of arcgis server while delivering a rich interactive experience to our users
8305942 development was both fast and enjoyable and we are pleased with the functionality and performance of the application
8305943 because fewinterventions in critically ill adult patients reduce mortality to thisextent the results of this trial were enthusiastically received andrapidly incorporated into guidelines
8305944 these recommendations have led to worldwide adoptionof tight glucose control in a variety of intensive care unit icu settings
8305945 given the overall findings of thismeta analysis it seems appropriate that the guidelines recommendingtight glucose control in all critically ill patients should bere evaluated until the results of larger more definitive clinicaltrials are available
8305946 possible explanations for the discordant results of the study by vanden berghe et al and the meta analysis by wiener et al are that themeta analysis is flawed the studies that form the basis of themeta analysis are flawed or inherently different or the findings ofthe study by van den berghe et al occurred due to random chance or as aresult of another unique factor interacting with tight glycemiccontrol
8305947 those investigating tight glycemic control should take astep back and address the fundamental questions of defining qualitystandards for tight glycemic control finding affordable methods offrequent and highly accurate measurement of blood glucose in the icu and conduct multicenter efficacy studies to determine if tighterglycemic control can reduce mortality under optimal conditions iftighter glycemic control can be proven effective in optimal conditions determining how to make that benefit available to millions ofcritically ill patients in both developed and resource poor countriesaround the world would be a truly worthwhile challenge there is nosimple or clear answer to the complex problem of glycemic control incritically ill adults at present targeting tight glycemic controlcannot be said to be either right or wrong
8305948 this years rankings show that market events rather than just advertising alone can be critical drivers to brand websites
8305949 pharmaceutical companies need to ensure that brand websites contain the latest most accurate content possible and can be found relatively easily by physicians using search engines to research pharmaceutical information
8305950 no study has been able to directly link changes in the brain with changes in memory so our study helps to fill in this gap
8305951 although the findings do not change overall debate on the use of estrogen therapy to reduce age related cognitive decline our study illustrates that specific molecules may be identified that are critical to estrogens ability to modulate memory
8305952 therefore it may be possible to design drugs to target these molecules and directly affect memory and since such drugs would not be hormones they could produce the beneficial effects of estrogen treatment without the side effects of current hormone therapy
8305953 private health initiatives that pay for the care of children are running out of money causing them to limit the number they cover

8305956 the judge agreed with our evidence that patients would suffer if the payment cuts were allowed to stand
8305957 we presented compelling evidence that many family physicians would be unable to continue seeing medi cal patients
8305958 because the department of health care services medi cal payments already were far below the costs of providing care the cut would have forced many family physicians to close their practices to new medi cal patients
8305959 as advocates for our patients and for the publics health we just could not stand by and watch patients access to care deteriorate even further than it already has
8305960 when family physicians are forced for economic reasons to stop seeing medi cal patients there is an impact on quality of life and cost of care
8305961 patients often delay seeking care and when they absolutely must see a doctor they end up in already overburdened emergency rooms where care is more expensive and follow up care cant be tracked the public health of california depends on people staying as well as possible and when ill being treated promptly primary care doctors including family physicians are the first line of defense against declining public health and escalating epidemics like obesity diabetes and heart disease the courts decision keeps this critical public health element in place

8305972 world of warcraft is designed as a pc game its designed to have a keyboard and a mouse so the controls and the control scheme that you have are very pc centric if you think about mapping those controls and all those different type of buttons that you have to a console without a keyboard for chatting its a very challenging proposition its really not that we have anything against consoles i mean we love console games also and im sure there will be a successful mmo sometime on a console so it has nothing to do with that its just more like a square peg round hole thing for our game it just wasnt designed with that in mind

8305984 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
8305985 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
8305986 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
8305987 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
8305988 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
8305989 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
8305990 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
8305991 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
8305992 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
8305993 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing

8305998 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
8305999 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother

8306100 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
8306101 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
8306102 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
8306103 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
8306104 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise

8306106 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
8306107 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
8306108 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
8306109 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you

8306111 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
8306112 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
8306113 we need to discard ruthlessly but cunningly in order to fight under difficult conditions we will be traveling light without baggage and clutter from earlier modes of existence we need to preserve precisely those implements that serve the advance against fierce opposition toward our end goal we need to integrate them into a vibrant new communist coherency as we thrive on the run
8306114 we need a process a going where we sort things through think afresh and start to act together
8306115 here is the line your job is to grasp it reorient your thinking and implement it
8306116 the new connectedness of production and communications the global shifts of industry the mass migrations of people the changes in class structures the dynamics of modern warfare the capitalist transformation of remaining feudal relations the new interpenetrations and conflicts of imperialist powers the basis and limitations shaping the unprecedented attempt to establish a global u s hegemony the development of political islam and the stark historically new ways the emancipation of women is posed
8306117 there are related analyses of the u s itself that are needed including deepening understanding of the impact of de industrialization of the working class and changes in the structures of national oppression i e racist oppression of minority people in the u s
8306118 these changes and more are driving a world process quite different from the one explored in earlier communist analysis
8306119 when encountering communists people all over the world demand to know what we have learned from this exhilarating and painful process and what we would now do differently

8306122 t he banking problems in the united states continue to mount while the federal governments deficit continues to soar out of control so what happened to cause the dollar to rally over the past three weeks in a word
8306123 when central banks intervene in the currency markets they exchange their currency for dollars
8306124 on july 16 2008 the federal reserve reported holding 2 349 billion of us government paper in custody for central banks in its report released today this amount had grown over the past three weeks to 2 401 billion a 38 4 annual rate of growth so central banks were accumulating dollars over the past three weeks at a rate far above what one would expect as a result of the us trade deficit the logical conclusion is that they were intervening in currency markets they were buying dollars for the purpose of propping it up to keep the dollar from falling off the edge of the cliff and doing so ignited a short covering rally which is not too difficult to do given the leverage employed in the markets these days by hedge funds and others
8306125 theres a crisis in the white house and to save the election theyd have to fake a war
8306126 washingtons bloody fingerprints are all over the invasion of south ossetia georgia president mikhail saakashvili would never dream of launching a massive military attack unless he got explicit orders from his bosses at 1600 pennsylvania ave after all saakashvili owes his entire political career to american power brokers and us intelligence agencies if he disobeyed them hed be gone in a fortnight besides an operation like this takes months of planning and logistical support especially if its perfectly timed to coincide with the beginning of the olympic games another petty neocon touch that means pentagon planners must have been working hand in hand with georgian generals for months in advance nothing was left to chance
8306127 if you think self publishing is dishonorable and not worthwhile and prefer the contest route why do you care what those who propose it as an option think i embrace my dishonor and unworthiness besides i wouldnt shut any book contests down even if i had the power and wont be burning my bras in protest theyre much too expensive and a good fit is difficult to find i promise you that no matter what i say or write there will always be contests for you to send your money to i am no threat to the status quo

8306172 we will not allow more outrages upon our institution and much less attacks on police officers
8306173 i believe it is important to get every member of congress on the record do they stand with hard pressed americans who are trying to pay their gas bills at the gas station or do they once again stand with the big oil companies thats a vote im going to try to get because i want to know where they stand and i want them to tell us are they with us or against us
8306174 i dont think it is a good energy policy to depend upon the kindness of the saudis while businesses and individuals are trying to figure out how theyre going to afford nearly 4 a gallon gas and nearly 5 a gallon diesel
8306175 the impact is really beginning to ripple dramatically through the economy
8306176 i think its very important that we do something more dramatic than going to have tea with the saudis
8306177 the saudis may decide well we better do something to help out president bush but thats a short term fix it is not going to have any long term consequences and we just have to take a different approach if were going to begin to get serious

8306233 it was parked outside the house and i know it was definitely still there at 2 30am
8306234 the feet which are used to steady it when its parked were down and it would have taken them about half an hour to get them up
8306235 actually you could see from marks on the road that theyd dragged it along for a bit with the feet still down even turning it to drive it out of the street would have taken some time so they were at it for a while you would have thought someone would have heard something
8306236 he asked me if i was selling it and when i said no he told me hed give me humble money for it which i suppose means he wouldnt give me much

8306256 we discussed the pump station failure and current drainage cleaning in warrenpoint
8306257 we also received assurances that compensation claims for flood damage will be paid immediately so it was a positive meeting
8306258 the agencies listened to our proposals to address problems in certain areas of rostrevor

8306273 let us commit ourselves to pray to pray for the dalai lama himself that he would meet the risen lord jesus and be confronted with ultimate truth and for those who have embraced his erroneous gospel to the present generation of westerners who reject moral absolutes and despise any claim to spiritual exclusivity it is no wonder the dalai lama is so popular ive heard the dalai lama say with a casual wave of his hand if you think my message is nonsense then forget it thanks i think i might and ill stick with jesus the true incarnation of god
8306274 does it break gods heart today that hundreds of millions of buddhists are marching to hell with little or no gospel witness does it break the saviors heart that millions worship lifeless idols instead of the true glorious heavenly father

8306282 certainly im no fan of buddhism the teachings of buddhism cannot hold a candle to the life of jesus christ as ive written previously christianity is superior to buddhism ethically historically and factually
8306283 mongolian society has primarily been informed by the world views of atheism and buddhism but they dont seem to be able to affect the kind of character in society that makes corruption a source of personal shame if these world views actually had that ability then one would expect with such a long history here that corruptions acceptability would not be on the rise the same is true in other nations primarily informed by these world views
8306284 they atheism and buddhism dont seem to be able to affect the kind of character in society that makes corruption a source of personal shame
8306285 if a mongolian wants to be a buddhist and openly express his buddhism let him
8306286 as one former mongolian buddhist said to me about why he finally rejected buddhism in favor of christ in buddhism there is no love comparatively speaking he is correct

8306294 my reply to that is he went 11 0 at boston college in 1940 and beat tennessee in the sugar bowl
8306295 thats even more impressive than what he did at notre dame also almost all teams had a lot of material with everyone coming back from the war
8306296 eleven years at notre dame is like 30 years at other schools
8306297 its like the difference between the governor of montana and the mayor of new york city the latter has much more stress
8306298 he taught me so many lessons in life i couldnt even begin to name them all
8306299 he was a perfectionist he stuck to the basics and believed in outhitting people you were either a hitter or you werent a hitter if you were a hitter you played
8306300 he wanted it done right and if you did it right he wanted you to do it again and then once you got it right youd do it a couple more times to remember how to do it right
8306301 i think he would be every bit as good today as he was back then
8306302 if youre going to be a great coach you have to have discipline you have to have fundamentals you have to have the players respect and you have to be able to teach and adjust to different things in the game none of that changes in coaching

8306307 almost all the right notes tonight she did not say obama was ready to be commander in chief
8306308 she did not say anything positive about obama as a person her reasons for supporting obama were all ways of saying that obama is a democrat
8306309 hillary was looking great and communicating one message but for our crazy rules id be the nominee and wed be 15 point ahead
8306310 so shes announcing yeah ill do the minimum required of me but gee if you wanted me to be an attack dog you should have made me veep and if you wanted my full support of the democratic nominee you should have made me the democratic nominee
8306311 nothing she said tonight will be incompatible with what shell want to say if obama loses in november told you so
8306312 she was intensely annoying you could just about hear the sound of television sets clicking off all across america good night hillary
8306313 the congestion charge and the biggest investment programme since the second world war has enabled london to become the first major city in the world to achieve a shift away from the private car to public transport the charge is also reducing pollution and i am building on this by altering the charge to penalise the big vehicles which contribute most to climate change and exempting the cleanest cars nationally and internationally cities are following londons example and considering introducing a similar charge the congestion charge has made london a world leader in doing something about traffic congestion and pollution rather than just talking about it
8306314 our studies show that with only three out of every 10 people of military age being capable of joining the army we are going to have to do something different
8306315 that landmine may have put an end to my military career that day but it didnt put an end to my secret that would come years later when i realized that i had fought and nearly died to secure rights for others that i myself was not free to enjoy i had proudly served a country that was not proud of me more importantly my experience disproved all the arguments against open service by gays and lesbians i knew i had to share my story
8306316 allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly is unlikely to pose any significant risk to morale good order discipline or cohesion
8306317 large sums of money have recently been committed in europe to reducing the negative environmental effects of aircraft use and research is already developing technologies which can improve the performance of engine components however the limitations of the existing technologies mean that the industry cannot reach the goals set in the vision 2020 report made by the advisory council of aeronautical research in europe acare new engine core configurations with heat management and active systems as well as advanced combustor technology have to be investigated to reduce co2 and nox nitrogen oxide emissions newac will validate the new technologies in rigs or core engine demonstrators between 2008 and 2010 this will enable the engine manufacturer to introduce these innovative technologies in the next generation of aero engines which will make it to market around the years 2013 2015

8306323 energy bars are familiar to many americans but other energized foods such as candy chips milk and cereal are definitely not we expect the concept of energy both physical and mental to greatly influence food product development
8306324 energy is poised to take food in a new direction giving consumers who need a boost many different ways to get it
8306325 from natural energizers like omega 3s or antioxidants to foods that are fortified with energizing ingredients we are seeing energy to emerge as a core benefit in new food products
8306326 this trend shows that consumers may be distinguishing between somewhat unhealthy stimulants which they desire and high sugar content in drinks which they do not
8306327 stimulants could be infused into many other foods breakfast foods may be a particularly good candidate including energy giving cereals breads and spreads
8306328 energy drinks have quickly become a daily beverage choice as more americans use energy drinks weve seen a rise in products being launched with innovative new ingredients claims and consumer targets

8306330 the centre remained poorly equipped to mitigate the inevitably damaging effects of substantial periods of detention on such a vulnerable population
8306331 we were particularly troubled by the plight of single women their situation should be addressed as a matter of urgency
8306332 we were concerned to find two recent examples of forced medication applied to detainees threatening self harm which had not been subject to thorough review to ensure their appropriateness
8306333 the safety and security of female and male detainees at tinsley house is taken very seriously females have separate living accommodation and access to facilities such as the laundry or refectory at female only times we are determined to treat children with fairness and compassion and we only detain children where it is absolutely necessary

8306335 after much speculation i can confirm that gareth barry will not leave aston villa before the transfer window closes
8306336 gareth made the decision to stay two weeks ago and informed aston villa of his intentions
8306337 during this time discussions have taken place to decide the best way forward for all parties
8306338 any talks regarding potential new contracts at aston villa will not take place until the end of the season
8306339 its a very exciting find because you rarely come across the bones in their original skeletal shape
8306340 we have found vertebrae ribs and a thigh bone of a very big adult dinosaur from the early cretaceous period
8306341 its also enormous we first found a femur thigh bone 1 80m long articulated with the hip then bigger and bigger ribs up to 2 40m
8306342 those from the early cretaceous period are much less common and one of this size is vary rare so we are able to advance our knowledge of the group in this period
8306343 we want to situate this dinosaur in the context of sauropod dinosaurs we have considerable hope that it may be a new species linked to the brachiosaurus and for which wed have to find a new name
8306344 if you have a neck six to eight metres long how do you lift that huge weight so the bone content was reduced by air holes
8306345 we ll have to shore it up strengthen it with polyurethane lift it with a crane itll take ages
8306346 between hiking mountain biking chairlift riding disc golf geocaching canoe rentals tennis and swimming we project that when marketed effectively the recreation area will become a popular destination for local families and visitors to the region throughout the summer
8306347 the site is well positioned halfway between portland and acadia national park an extremely popular summer destination by charging affordable fees for a few of the activities mentioned above and offering a snack service or snack bar on summer weekends it will be possible to offset a portion of the overhead expense of operating the recreation area while furthering its mission and contributing to the economic health of the community managed properly this use of the facility is expected to have less impact than ski operations on the surrounding neighborhood
8306348 raise the cost of living and injure the great majority of our citizens
8306349 there was an assumption that all sections of society reap benefits from national budgets in reality that doesnt happen
8306350 the way in which the national budget is formulated ignores the different socially determined roles responsibilities capabilities of women and men and rights conferred on them respectively
8306351 grb does not mean we need more money it is not about a separate budget for men and women it is a method which encourages those making programmes and budget to also address the needs and interests of individuals that belong to different social groups
8306352 we have only just evaluated how much of our budget is gender responsive we havent yet made programmes in a way that they are gender sensitive
8306353 we talk about gender equality but have separate investments for men and women thats where we go wrong
8306354 in rural nepal women spend maximum time in agriculture yet she has no rights over land she cannot even take loans every year thousands of women die during childbirth yet in many part of rural nepal there isnt even one midwife
8306355 we have 33 per cent womens participation in the constituent assembly if we can have the same amount of women at the local level especially in decision making positions they would push for gender sensitive policies and regulations
8306356 if we are working on the basis of our mutual interests then its logical to implement this agreement
8306357 this is an old way of doing things that has nothing to do with modern realities

8306370 in products from sunscreen to industrial coatings consumers are seeing the benefits of products built with materials measured in billionths of a meter nanotechnology offers vast promise and commercial opportunities opportunity however goes hand in hand with risk
8306371 nanotechnology adds an entirely new and largely unexplored realm of risks spread across the entire spectrum of modern commerce these emerging risks require a sophisticated approach by risk managers and businesses these risks carry with them the potential for far reaching effects on market cycles manufacturing and the safety security and well being of consumers the task of identifying these risks is complicated by the fact that scientists are still discovering how nanoparticles perform in manufactured products and how they react with humans and the environment
8306372 in addition corporate risk managers may not have recognized yet the role that nanotechnology is already playing or will be playing in their own businesses as nanotechnology plays a growing role in commerce insurers and underwriters will be increasingly taking these risks into account risk managers and insurers should strive to keep ahead of the issue of risk identification as nanotechnology makes its impact felt in the manufacturing legislative regulatory and legal arenas as well as in the realm of insurance underwriting
8306373 the day is all about celebrating elys culture and traditions and encouraging awareness and use of the eel trail we hope to continue to build on this unique event each year and involve more and more businesses and organisations and further raise the profile of the isle of eels

8306375 the eel throwing competition is also back and expanded to include adults as well as children this year

8306382 for the stomp box we use a square of strong plywood about a square yard but could be smaller and 4 pieces of 4 x4 pine cut so it fits together with a mic inside it its stuck together with velcro we also pad the top parts of the supporting pine with foam to make it less clacky we use an audio technica atm87r condenser mic designed for bass drums generally to get our type of sound you need to turn down all the treble and mid on the desk and whack the bass up as far as you can without getting feedback this gives a bassy dull thud if you want some attack to the sound then put some mid back in

8306385 we tried to give people as long a warning as possible about the closure of the maltings in october last year as there are so many events which take place at the building people have been very understanding about the need to get this work done and it will begin immediately to repair the roof
8306386 we hope to reopen in six months but obviously this will depend a lot on what the contractors find and the weather we have though made the promise that when the building reopens it will still have a cinema and will be available for community use i would like to stress that the building as it stands is perfectly safe and any work will be in keeping with the historic character of the building

8306433 certain recent events have shown how dangerous the conflict potential in some frozen conflicts as theyre commonly called can be
8306434 this became particularly apparent in south ossetia where as a result of aggressive actions after georgias leadership had basically gone crazy all those problems became exacerbated and essentially an armed conflict took place this is a very serious warning to everybody and i think we should consider other existing problems in this context now
8306435 most people in transdniester consider that since the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia was recognized transdniester can expect the same but the situation is completely different
8306436 relations between moldova and transdniester lack the ethnic element characteristic of the georgian south ossetian abkhaz conflict more importantly transdniester doesnt have the trump card that abkhazia and south ossetia had a common border with the russian federation
8306437 i think russia is capable of repeating this aggression against azerbaijan by using the conflict in nagorno karabakh
8306438 its russia that occupies 20 percent of azerbaijani territory under armenias flag its russia that hampers any step toward a resolution russia doesnt want this conflict to be settled because it needs this conflict to harass azerbaijan to get azerbaijan back into the russian empire
8306439 i think it would actually show them how dangerous it would be to start a war in the caucasus the amount of destruction that can be caused and how dangerous that could be for azerbaijan
8306440 it will complicate the karabakh peace process because of the fact that the russians and the americans are two out of three mediators
8306441 russia and the united states have managed to cooperate quite well in the minsk group up until now on karabakh but i think the u s russian relationship is now so bad in the caucasus that it will be hard for them to trust each other as they have in the past in the minsk group
8306442 it has shown that having monitors on the ground means very little if one of the two sides or both the sides want to fight
8306443 the osce monitors in south ossetia were completely irrelevant just as the un was in abkhazia when the abkhaz wanted to retake the kodori gorge they just basically told the united nations were going in and youd better get out

8306474 im sure that there will be other titles created but as far as retro studios is concerned were taking a break for a little bit we started with the core ideas of the game but we did not receive the information about the wii controller until well into development so we got a big surprise of hey this is what were going to do for the next console many things had to be refactored but actually many things fell right into place the wii remote enables us to do things that we hadnt previously done in other metroid games

8306501 the system is supposed to make it more regimented make sure that everything happens in a particular fashion and from that perspective it would be good

8306582 i think he will very much strike the same tone as hillary clinton did of the importance of bringing the party together
8306583 i think it will have little to do with trying to diss obama or not
8306584 no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8306585 its a tough moment she clearly felt she was the right person for the job and she didnt get it
8306586 so she has to come out there and do everything she can to persuade her people that theyve got to come together and that a divided party is a defeated party
8306587 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for
8306588 there is still work to do on the bill clinton front
8306589 i think the democrats understand just how tough this is going to be
8306590 clearly the american people are now looking back and saying what else is there i think its going to be a tough challenge for sen obama and hes got to do it over the next couple of days the democrats have really got to put more meat on the bone and let people know why they should win and sen mccain should lose
8306591 if you listen to all the speeches up to sen clintons speech they were full of talk about the need to stop jobs from being taken overseas
8306592 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for

8306607 the oil market has changed we expect the spare capacity cushion to remain worryingly low towards 2013 this would suggest that prices are unlikely to return to the levels of a few years ago
8306608 high oil prices have forced us to revise down our 2008 demand numbers and the ongoing issues of field decline project delays and geopolitics have lowered our expectations on the supply side
8306609 production will be increasingly dominated by a small number of major producers where oil resources are concentrated opecs share is expected to grow significantly from 42 now to 52 by 2030 in contrast non opec output is expected to peak in the middle of the next decade
8306610 current counter narcotics policies are failing to address the loss of the southern provinces to the dual scourges of poppy production and terrorism
8306611 this decrease is no more than a ripple in the ocean
8306612 without an urgent change of direction in the countrys counter narcotics policies the international community will be unable to prevent the consolidation of opium production in the south of the country and the consolidation of the taliban which is financed by the illegal drugs trade
8306613 with no crop to sell many afghan farmers now face a heavy burden of debt which can only be repaid by planting more poppy in the coming season
8306614 crop eradication has failed to reduce these provinces opium output while succeeding to push impoverished afghan farmers further into the arms of the taliban insurgency
8306615 it is clear that a long term sustainable solution is required to solve afghanistans opium crisis and prevent the insurgencys funding by illegal cultivation
8306616 poppy for medicine would allow farmers to diversify their crops and give afghanistan an opportunity to be part of a legal pharmaceutical industry we need the afghan people on our side if we are to be successful there and this initiative could go a long way to winning back much needed hearts and minds which would be highly beneficial for our troops fighting there

8306620 this overhaul of the endangered species act would place the fate of rare species in the hands of government stakeholders who are not qualified to assess the environmental impacts of their activities
8306621 what if we allowed pharmaceutical companies to approve and distribute drugs without consulting the food and drug administration
8306622 the result would spell potential disaster for humans in this case the vulnerable party is our environment

8306625 lost earning potential costs associated with treating coexisting conditions social security payments homelessness and incarceration are just some of the indirect costs associated with mental illnesses that have been difficult to quantify
8306626 this study shows us that just one source of these indirect costs is staggeringly high
8306627 the results of this study confirm the belief that mental disorders contribute to enormous losses of human productivity
8306628 yet this estimate is probably conservative because the survey used did not assess people in hospitals or prisons and included very few participants with autism schizophrenia or other chronic illnesses that are known to greatly affect a persons ability to work the actual costs are probably higher that what we have estimated

8306699 as i give thought to the matter i find four causes for the apparent misery of old age first it withdraws us from active accomplishments second it renders the body less powerful third it deprives us of almost all forms of enjoyment fourth it stands not far from death

8306701 we have reviewed public safety data and have determined that a temporary alcohol ban is necessary to maintain a quality beach experience for silver strand visitors over this busy holiday weekend
8306702 during july 2008 the number of alcohol related arrests and citations issued at this beach equals that for all of 2005 2006 and 2007 combined in addition our lifeguards have documented a dramatic increase in alcohol related rescues there this summer
8306703 we are committed to maintaining a safe enjoyable family oriented beach experience for our visitors
8306704 we will continue to monitor alcohol related arrests and citations at silver strand in the months ahead
8306705 wow i bet we could use these and rebuild a chicken out of all these bones
8306706 we cannot accept these violations of international law of accords for security and cooperation in europe of united nations resolutions and the taking of a territory by the army of a neighboring country
8306707 i hope that didnt happen overnight but there has already been evidence that the armies are pushing away the ossetians who favored georgia and in a certain way yes an ethnic cleansing is taking place
8306708 the initial idea was to negotiate a quick two pager to cease hostilities but this has now turned into something more substantial around agreeing the principles of how to run the company
8306709 a deal is a few weeks away they are likely to sign something
8306710 we agreed not to comment on the negotiations and we feel its really important to honour that agreement

8306717 recent studies have shown that a significant proportion of eukaryotic genes are mispredicted at the transcript level as the mispred routines are able to detect many of these errors and may aid in their correction we suggest that it may significantly improve the quality of protein sequence data based on gene predictions
8306718 some secreted proteins may truly lack secretory signal peptides since they are subject to leaderless protein secretion similarly it cannot be excluded at present that transchromosomal chimeras can be formed and may have normal physiological functions nevertheless the fact that mispred analyses of protein sequences of the swiss prot database identified very few such exceptions indicates that the rules of mispred are generally valid

8306721 its probably no coincidence that many languages around the world have repetitious syllables in their child words baby and daddy in english papa in italian and tata grandpa in hungarian for example
8306722 the language centre of most right handed adults is located on the left side of the brain
8306723 this is consistent with our finding with new born babies and supports our belief humans are born with abilities that allow us to perceive and learn our mother tongue systematically and efficiently

8306725 if you reduce uric acid at least in some patients you may be able to reduce blood pressure
8306726 this could be one way people develop hypertension and may allow us to develop new therapies
8306727 this is far from being a reasonable therapeutic intervention for high blood pressure but these findings indicate a first step in understanding the pathway of the disease
8306728 you cannot prevent a disease until you know the cause this study is way of finding that out
8306729 the antihypertensive therapies available to patients are well proven and safe
8306730 currently available antihyperuricemic therapies treatments that lower uric acid are not safe enough to be used as first line therapy for most people with high blood pressure
8306731 the book is exceptional in its clarity and depth i would recommend it to anyone with a tendency to hypertension
8306732 hypertension is an important member of the quartet of risk factors for cardiovascular disease the other three are elevated cholesterol levels diabetes and cigarette smoking
8306733 the brains ability to reorganize itself is much greater than previously believed
8306734 in our studies in which a group of sighted study subjects were blindfolded for five days we have shown that even in an adult the normally developed visual system quickly becomes engaged to process touch in response to complete loss of sight the speed and dynamic nature of the changes we observed suggest that rather than establishing new nerve connections which would take a long time the visual cortex is unveiling abilities that are normally concealed when sight is intact
8306735 in a sense by masking the eyes we unmask the brains compensatory potential
8306736 half of the study participants remained completely blindfolded 24 hours a day for a total of five days under the careful watch of the staff of bidmcs general clinical research center the other half were only blindfolded for testing but spent the rest of the day seeing normally during their stays both sets of study participants underwent intensive braille instruction for four to six hours a day from a professional instructor from the carroll center for the blind
8306737 this extremely rapid adaptation indicates that functions that are normally inhibited in the brains visual cortex will come to the surface when they are needed
8306738 we believe that over time if these adaptive functions are sustained and reinforced they will eventually lead to permanent structural changes
8306739 our brain captures different types of information from the world sounds sights smells or tactile sensations
8306740 the impressions we form require us to merge these various different elements but sciences traditional view of brain function is that it is organized in separate and highly specialized systems
8306741 our study shows that these views are incorrect and illustrate the potential for the human brain to rapidly and dynamically reorganize itself
8306742 we have shown that even in an adult the normally developed visual system quickly becomes engaged to process touch in response to complete loss of sight and we believe that these principles may also apply to other sensory loss such as deafness or loss of function following brain injury

8306760 their purpose is not to support the us taxpayer or the us economy or to ensure stable global markets if by doing that they get a side benefit thats great but their principal job is to benefit the stakeholders
8306761 looking at the broad evidence there has been appetite whether that appetite can continue with further deterioration thats very difficult to say but right now you have seen news there are people still interested to participate in these transactions
8306762 when you reach a size like us 3 trillion and you start to grow i think the ability to pick up the opportunistic transactions and think on a strategic basis becomes challenging
8306763 we know that other countries like venezuela and mexico also have problems with drug trafficking and kidnapping
8306764 whats becoming clear is the depth to which this activity has penetrated colombias institutions and the families who run them
8306765 these scandals showing ties between crime groups and the state solidify opposition to the trade pact in washington
8306766 we have always wanted to acquire an international chain of hotels and resorts and were looking for a product that we felt was missing from the market stein looked like a good strategic fit
8306767 theres been a big drop in fortiss share price recently but we believe its financial operating capability and development potential are very strong and we are very confident in this investment

8306769 amounted to a bold reassertion of russian power in a region that moscow considers part of its sphere of influence and a pointed challenge to president bush who had warned the kremlin not to recognize the territories the day before
8306770 in a written statement bush urged russia to reconsider this irresponsible decision which he said violated u n resolutions as well as the french brokered cease fire agreement that ended the fighting between russia and georgia russias action only exacerbates tensions and complicates diplomatic negotiations he said
8306771 the kremlins decision tuesday to recognize the independence of georgias two breakaway enclaves deepens what has become the wests worst crisis with moscow since the end of the cold war a crisis that has revealed its lack of leverage over a confident aggressive russia
8306772 the bush administration and its european allies stung by russias formal recognition of two separatist georgian enclaves faced new pressure tuesday to strike back diplomatically and politically against the kremlins widening move to assert its power in the caucasus
8306773 charles kupchan who was a national security council aide in the clinton administration said the russian policy is a miscalculation because it strengthens those in both the united states and europe who believe its time for the west to take some serious steps to respond to russian behavior
8306774 the study results show that current australian guidelines for prescribing antibiotics for pneumonia are appropriate dr charles said
8306775 it shows that australian doctors should resist the push which is occurring in some parts of the world particularly the us to prescribe broad spectrum antibiotics to treat essentially all possible causes
8306776 the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacterial pathogens is one of the biggest threats to australian health care standards and is closely linked to the inappropriate use of antibiotics dr charles said
8306777 by continuing to use more traditional antibiotics to treat most cases of pneumonia australian doctors can limit or delay the emergence of more resistant strains of bacteria
8306778 by using the broad spectrum antibiotics less often we can also prolong the effective lifespan of these drugs researchers uncover molecule that keeps pathogens like salmonella in check
8306779 the survey reveals there are some big unheard messages these kind of data help us to quantify the differences between countries and to highlight where additional efforts are needed some of these countries have rarely had any population survey data to help their programme planning efforts
8306780 we know that people need to be given a reason why they should change they need to be shown how to change they need to be given resources or support to change they need to remember to change and they need positive reinforcement for changing many of these principles can be applied in designing education programmes to encourage and support behaviour change

8306786 what drivers dont realize is that ethanol is one third less energy per gallon
8306787 so if i have a gallon of gas sitting here and a gallon of ethanol im going to get more energy out of a gallon of gas than on a gallon of ethanol
8306788 virtually every car on the road runs on e10 just fine with no problems whatsoever
8306789 you can immediately go to 14 billion gallons of ethanol without having to worry about infrastructure concerns like the cars engine or gas pumps or anything like that
8306790 so if you have a non ffv and you pump it into your vehicle youre going to have a very serious large expense in front of you to the tune of thousands of dollars vehicles that dont run on e85 if you do pump it into those vehicles the problem is it will corrode the fuel lines the tank the fuel pump destroy the fuel filter etc
8306791 if you are comparing performance and that kind of stuff e85 is an extremely high performance fuel and thats why the indy racing league runs exclusively on ethanol
8306792 today ethanol is becoming far more of a viable alternative to gasoline as will other technologies like hybrids and plug in hybrids and all of this other stuff that will come its ethanol that is the first foot in the door
8306793 the energy crisis is this country today is such that we cant afford to take any options off the table biofuels and ethanol in particular offer us a very logical and a very easy first step

8306850 you are not such wiseacres as to think or say that you can expound the scripture without the assistance from the works of divine and learned men who have labored before you in the field of exposition it seems odd that certain men who talk so much of what the holy spirit reveals to themselves should think so little of what he has revealed to others

8306859 hello my name is steve and im a functional atheist
8306860 cheap grace is the preaching of forgiveness without requiring repentance baptism without church discipline communion without confession cheap grace is grace without discipleship grace without the cross grace without jesus christ
8306861 of course you have sinned but now everything is forgiven so you can stay as you are and enjoy the consolations of forgiveness
8306862 what shall we say then are we to continue in sin so that grace may increase may it never be how shall we who died to sin still live in it
8306863 the problem i have is that while im all for debate
8306864 here is the atheistic lie 1 evolution is correct view of the development of life 2 evolution does not require god 3 therefore god was not involved in the development of life this is such a scary proposition that christians have inherently attacked number 1 and you might be saying that the danger of te is to water down that attack i say that the proper fight is not with 1 but with 3
8306865 at heart though youre argument isnt with me or with karen but with god work on that one a bit and then reconsider your statements
8306866 the first part of the list flat earthers geocentrists and young earth creationists tend from my view not to care about physical evidence and get creative when it comes to fitting physical observation into their interpretation of creation
8306867 for since the creation of the world his invisible attributes his eternal power and divine nature having been clearly seen being understood through what has been made so that they are without excuse
8306868 the flaw in your logic is your supposition that science and faith are mutually exclusive
8306869 many in the faith community who hold that the sciences confirm that which is held by faith
8306870 none of these folks have trouble balancing scientific observation with faith
8306871 your bias blinds you to any possibility that faith and science can coexist and interact
8306872 take a look around beyond the narrow bounds of talk origins and youll find a lively and sometimes civil discussion going on
8306873 at heart though youre argument isnt with me or with karen but with god
8306874 science will never detect whether or not a supernatural entity had any influence on the development of life

8306896 there are still several tasks to which i would have liked to contribute

8306908 particularly intriguing are the unusual categories of vocalizations and the more frequent loud harmonics evident in the btbr t tf j btbr mouse model of autism that may resemble the atypical vocalizations seen in some autistic infants
8306909 we hypothesize that ultrasonic vocalizations may be a measure of social communication in mice delayed reduced or unusual ultrasonic vocalizations in mice could offer a useful assay with reasonable face validity to the second diagnostic symptom of autism impaired communication
8306910 this pattern of associations with earlier age of nonmelanoma skin cancer diagnosis being linked more strongly to the risk of developing subsequent malignancies is consistent with the pattern that one would expect for a marker of inherited predisposition to cancer
8306911 our evidence indicates the earliest inhabitants of palau were of normal stature and it counters the evidence that berger et al presented in their paper indicating there was a reduced stature population in early palau
8306912 our research from whole bones and whole skeletons indicates that the earliest individuals in palau were of normal stature but gracile in other words they were thin
8306913 i think bergers primary mistakes were his not understanding the variation in the skeletal population in which he was working using fragmentary remains again in a situation where he didnt understand variation and stepping outside his own area of expertise which i think all scientists try not to do but sometimes we do
8306914 although we have not seen the material that berger et al base their results on we can speak to the diversity and normalcy of human skeletal series from throughout the archipelago that have been excavated from several burial caves over the last decade as well as the an abundance of archaeological linguistic and historical data indicating a general continuity of cultural traits over a period of three millennia
8306915 archaeological data also do not suggest a separate isolated group evolving differently biologically or culturally although there are subtle differences and changes that occur through time
8306916 had bergers team compared their scant dental metric data with those of other regions in the pacific or elsewhere in the world they would have seen that large teeth are not uncommon in early peoples of these regions
8306917 the results of this study represent a potentially new therapeutic approach that of control of a biochemical cause of hypertension rather than nonspecifically lowering elevated bp although not representing a fully developed therapeutic strategy this study raises an alternative strategy that may prove to be more effective than currently available options
8306918 we were surprised to find such a pronounced reduction in basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma incidence in users of ace inhibitors or arbs in such a high risk group over a short amount of time
8306919 because individuals at normal risk of keratinocyte cancer were not included in our study the extent to which the results might apply to such individuals is unknown
8306920 we need a whole new approach and we need to act now
8306921 our research shows that many of the worlds existing no take areas are in the wrong place
8306922 new protected zones are needed that focus on areas identified as escaping or recovering well from climate change impacts but a major focus needs to be shifted towards increasing the resilience of the system as a whole that means reducing as many other locally derived threats as possible
8306923 coral dies when it is put under stress so what we need to be doing is reducing the direct human impact such as over fishing pollution and sedimentation across the whole area
8306924 by removing all these other stresses we are giving the coral the best chance of surviving and recovering from any changes in temperature that may occur as a result of global warming
8306925 this provides the key to conserving coral reefs in the face of climate change
8306926 we are not suggesting that we scrap the existing ntas in terms of protecting fish stocks they have been quite successful shipwrecks on coral reefs harbor unwanted species
8306927 caregivers have similar cortisol levels as controls their cells seem to be hearing less of this signal in other words something goes awry in caregivers white blood cells so they are not able to receive the signal from cortisol that tells them to shut down inflammation
8306928 because people have traditionally thought that higher cortisol is the reason that stress contributes to disease but this work shows that at least in caregivers its actually the opposite theres too little cortisol signal being heard by the cells rather than too much
8306929 however since 1978 more than 80 cases of lead poisoning associated with ayurvedic medicine use have been reported worldwide
8306930 several indian manufactured rasa shastra medicines could result in lead and or mercury ingestions 100 to 10 000 times greater than acceptable limits

8306933 because few interventions in critically ill adult patients reduce mortality to this extent the results of this trial were enthusiastically received and rapidly incorporated into guidelines
8306934 these recommendations have led to worldwide adoption of tight glucose control in a variety of intensive care unit icu settings
8306935 we now report evidence that restoration of the functioning of the stress axis may be the key to how these new antidepressant approaches might work
8306936 almost half 45 of women with ovarian cancer are still alive at least 5 years after diagnosis women younger than 65 have better 5 year survival rates than older women if ovarian cancer is found and treated before the cancer has spread outside the ovary the 5 year survival rate is 92 however less than 20 of all ovarian cancers is found at this early stage

8306995 it seems that a new development occured over the weekend nathan explosion has met his illegitimate daughter judy evans
8306996 it could be used to implode the band from the inside out
8306997 here is dr albrecht schwingenhardbordson a family dynamics specialist to explain the situation
8306998 the girl in question is daughter of one betty evans a high school cheerleader and onetime sweetheart of nathan explosion when he played football they broke up when he dropped out of high school and began playing in a band judy was born seven months later betty has since then went on to be a successful nurse at a hospital in georgia raising the child on her own this revelation can do one of two things having a child may strengthen nathan making him feel more whole and complete or it could possibly tear dethklok apart
8306999 yes we will observe what happens let him get to know his progeny

8307004 the film itself may be a bit of an afterthought down here on the lido clocking in at a crisp 95 minutes burn after reading is a tightly wound slickly plotted spy comedy that couldnt be in bigger contrast to the coens last film the bloodsoaked brooding no country for old men burn in comparison is bit of a bantamweight fast moving lots of attitude and uncorking a killer punch when it can
8307005 the affection you felt from the coens for the misguided fools in fargo or raising arizona is lacking here for everyone except jenkins hapless and hopelessly love sick gym manager and while the film carries the audience with its entertaining if somewhat ludicrous blend of high level espionage and ab toning exercises it would perhaps be more rewarding if we could like the characters as well as laugh at them

8307018 our findings suggest that increased brain connections during chronic drug use may actually limit behavioral changes associated with drug addiction rather than support them
8307019 relapse or the resumption of active drug taking and drug seeking is very common in drug addicts
8307020 addiction related brain changes and behaviors seem to be hardwired and semipermanent and there are limited treatment options our data suggest that rather than trying to block the process of increasing dendritic spine density we may actually want to look at treatments that try to enhance this process
8307021 this suggests the exciting possibility that mef2 proteins may control expression of key genes that modulate drug related brain changes and behavior
8307022 if we understand which genes are influenced by mef2 we can intervene and try to help the system resist or reverse these sensitization processes

8307033 its a very exciting find because you rarely come across the bones in their original skeletal shape
8307034 we have found vertebrae ribs and a thigh bone of a very big adult dinosaur from the early cretaceous period
8307035 its also enormous we first found a femur thigh bone 1 80m long articulated with the hip then bigger and bigger ribs up to 2 40m
8307036 those from the early cretaceous period are much less common and one of this size is vary rare so we are able to advance our knowledge of the group in this period
8307037 we want to situate this dinosaur in the context of sauropod dinosaurs we have considerable hope that it may be a new species linked to the brachiosaurus and for which wed have to find a new name

8307075 make no mistake theyll die inside if this team doesnt make it to the 2008 world series
8307076 everyone in tech has rope burns around their necks from doing business with the carriers they hung themselves trying to do carrier deals
8307077 the basic problem with mobile is that the operators are in the way
8307078 the application community and the venture community that finances them are rightly tired of what can be perceived as a small global cadre of folks in the carrier community as well as egregious application qualification processes putting a chokehold on the deployment of innovation in the applications space and the chokehold is stifling innovation and growth of the wireless data applications business
8307079 one really cool company got a trial with a few operators a small problem their application bricked i e killed dead dead dead the phones of some of the trial users other applications usually written by folks that are accustomed to the massive memory and hard drives of pcs or mac are waaay too resource intensive memory processing power for anything but the top tier of smart phones and even with that tiny market performance of the apps is often suspect another application fixed now kept a persistent data connection up between the phone and carrier network this is a huge issue as a lot of users still dont have unlimited data and if an app is sucking data without them knowing it it could be costing them a fortune let along putting an anchor on the data performance of the operators network
8307080 for the operators the simplistic reality is that the bottom line is the bottom line and they cannot allow applications to either 1 raise their costs structures or 2 damage their brand customer base because when things go wrong with an application or phone people blame the operator every piece of research i have seen or conducted over the past decade makes that point clear and just why do operators need to protect their network a few months ago i saw a ceo of a major operator speak in the q amp a he mentioned as an answer to a question that it costs him a minimum of 8 per phone call to answer a support call thats not counting the pissed off customer factor and dilution of the brand that hes spent billions of dollars or euros building
8307081 at a recent developers conference an operator was telling a story of a section of a city where service parameters all went to hell cells shrinking customers losing service they tracked it back to an enterprise customer that had gotten permission to test a new piece of hardware and that hardware was causing nasty network effects bad another example not as brutal is when several applications that when i asked about some trial metrics with persistence or even no persistence but frequent network access were impeding customers ability to make or receive voice calls very bad again something operators just aint gonna allow because when these things start to happen customers are going to look down at their phone look at the logo on the phone and get pissed at their operator and pissed off customers churn and churn makes operators metrics look bad and bad metrics make financial markets unhappy and unhappy financial markets make operator executives lose their jobs so it just wont happen

8307108 i dont think we have had too many problems playing against asian countries but i think that uzbekistans style will probably suit our team better
8307109 definitely the players are more used to playing against european type football

8307111 i met him in istanbul i saw him train and play and he looks good
8307112 i think turkish football suits him well galatasaray love to play attacking football and that is good for harry
8307113 i am worried about mark not having a club its not an ideal situation
8307114 he is young and talented and played well in china
8307115 it is important to have him with us for the training camps and it is a good chance for him to show that he is a national team player
8307116 he probably wont play in the friendly but he has two weeks to get over his problem
8307117 im just so thrilled to be here and to have the opportunity to play because after the olympics it was obviously very disappointing
8307118 after beijing i thought you know i might not be able to compete here i really tried to do everything possible for my recovery i even went to australia to see my doctor and to be able to practise
8307119 but they found a few cysts that were causing inflammation the doctor just did lots of treatment to me he is also a chiropractor so he fixed my back and my neck and everything was so connected
8307120 i thought i served well and really moved good for the first round i went on a good roll at one point there
8307121 this takes a little bit of pressure off me because i know a little more about where my game is at
8307122 the olympic gold in doubles gave me a great lift
8307123 it really inspired me and i hope to use that to do well here
8307124 it is a special memory it was unbelievable to listen to the national anthem and share that moment with my friend
8307125 i was developing a good combination with him but whoever comes into inside centre it wont matter
8307126 it wont be as dominant i suppose as two playmakers but whether they bring stirling mortlock into inside centre or timana theyve both got the ability to ball play
8307127 robbie deans has encouraged timana to get in and ball play and thats what he has been doing and he is enjoying it
8307128 you look at the opportunities hes had so far and hes taken every one of them whether its been with australia a or the wallabies
8307129 hes obviously a quality player he can play in any position and in any arena in any game on any occasion its the same with ryan cross and stirling mortlock they are all great centres
8307130 one of the biggest strengths weve got at the moment is the impact our bench has been giving us
8307131 weve got a squad of 30 and the whole squad trains everyone gets an opportunity to train in their position
8307132 that certainly has an effect on the interchange players when they come on
8307133 they feel comfortable in their roles they can just go out there and play good football and thats what theyve been doing
8307134 previously in a lot of teams you probably focus on the starting xv making sure they get enough time in their positions
8307135 weve come over here for two games and our focus was to win both those games
8307136 we have obviously set our goals very high and we want to achieve those
8307137 as we manage through this challenging environment it has been our strategy to operate with leaner inventories execute on cost savings and streamlining opportunities and realign our businesses in order to focus our energies on our core brands lane bryant fashion bug and catherines
8307138 allows two powerful properties to work together to create a more seamless television viewing experience for their respective audiences
8307139 anthony john and gai all had a gun put to their head saying sign up or you dont get the extra boxes youre after
8307140 the ajc figured by getting those three on side that the rest of us would fall in line and follow like sheep and sign up it was a disgraceful tactic that has now split the association
8307141 there was no consultation with trainers but had there been life would have been more simple
8307142 i look up to him when i am playing not just for cricket but to show that if you persevere anything can happen
8307143 it is great to be celebrating his birthday to go to the same school and to have played cricket on this oval so many times
8307144 i love cricket it is amazing to be living in the same place the don lived
8307145 i have always dreamed of being a great cricketer and following in the dons footsteps
8307146 it is awesome to think we go to the same school
8307147 he bradman was chairman of selectors when i was captain in the 1950s
8307148 we would have many discussions about various players he was a person who very much knew his own mind he did not suffer fools gladly
8307149 he trotted down the pitch as i followed through to the side and by a strange coincidence our eyes met
8307150 talking about the olympics i think hes mark spitz and michael phelps and more
8307151 as far as im concerned hes the greatest sportsman ive ever seen
8307152 this is exactly the sort of thing my dad would have loved to have heard
8307153 it would have resonated with him he would have been surprised and touched by this if he was alive today
8307154 this is the first time weve done it its about improving the level of co ordination between the two teams
8307155 its a helpful partnershihp and theres been a lot more co operation between the two parties this time around administratively and in terms of games time operations medical nutritional and recovery strategies weve worked very closely with the aoc
8307156 because we physically are used to occupying some of the same space in the athletes village that the aussie olympians had albeit on a reduced format because our team size is smaller its nice to get their feedback on what works and doesnt work in village life
8307157 it gave us a chance to get some real good feedback from the aoc about how they found working with bocog and how they found the atmosphere of the host city and the general games experience from their perspective as well as the chinese perspective
8307158 the feedback were getting is wholly positive both bocog and china have prepared very well for both games
8307159 theres certainly a sense of excitement because paralympic sport is only a recent phenomenon in china they topped the medal table in athens but before that they struggled a bit
8307160 certainly in terms of practical stuff like accessability the chinese have gone out of their way to ensure all the games facilities and the village are first class
8307161 we expect some clubs to come up with lame offers
8307162 if anyones serious it will need to be an exceptional offer
8307163 we had to give chris judd up for the third selection in last years draft because he was out of contract but daniel kerr is contracted
8307164 so wed be entitled to another pick in the first three as well as an additional draft choice inside the top 10
8307165 daniel wants it all on his terms and that is not going to be the case
8307166 everyone thinks hes leaving but we doubt whether any other club has the firepower to get him
8307167 i have meetings with every afl club every four weeks and at some stages they have brought up daniel kerrs name
8307168 i have to give credit to daniel because he does get a lot of negative focus
8307169 a teenage kid has to go straight to an adult looking after themselves
8307170 all the clubs really do is dump them at a home and tell them what training days theyve got
8307171 theyre not really looking after them theyre just dumping them at places if they want to take teenage kids away from their families at such a young age they should take responsibility for their actions
8307172 clubs are constantly looking to improve their practices in dealing with the transition for young players
8307173 the youth competition is built around education and welfare requirements
8307174 certainly clubs are conscious of the need to continually invest in these programs
8307175 you need to remember that greg wasnt stolen from his family
8307176 his family would have had some input into his decision to leave home and come to sydney i can understand his sisters concern because blood is thicker than water
8307177 im 100 per cent up to do this for him and for my mum
8307178 ive spoken to him a few times hes in a pretty bad state as well hes telling me not to worry but how am i meant not to worry about him
8307179 well certainly be looking very favourably at extending bretts contract because the club has improved tremendously and we think theres more improvement to come
8307180 i dare say a few of us will have the blinkers on going inside the forward 50
8307181 id be a little bit disappointed if players are out on their own and theyre going to a real 50 50 contest
8307182 i have been involved in sports for a very long time being a sports official
8307183 i used to be in charge of snooker later after the cricket association was established i got to know more and more about cricket and began to like it more and more so i changed from snooker to cricket
8307184 i think that cricket in china is already moving ahead
8307185 they have 140 level one coaches and umpires theyve achieved that in the period since 2005 that is indeed very noteworthy
8307186 the icc has believed for quite some time that there is a real opportunity for cricket in china and one of our projects is to explore the possibility of cricket becoming very large in this country
8307187 china has such a strategic approach to everything they wont be benchmarking against some atoll in the pacific
8307188 they will be asking what is the world standard and trying to better it seeking prominence and world recognition
8307189 the icc came to us and said they had a very charming game which could be introduced to china and at that time the then vice president and secretary general of the cca paid a visit to hong kong to observe the hong kong international sixes
8307190 we found that cricket is very good for chinese people because it emphasises hand eye co ordination
8307191 now what we need to do urgently is improve our high performance
8307192 god has not always answered my prayers if he had i would have married the wrong men several times
8307193 in a pit with a lion on a snowy day
8307194 some day we will thank god more for our unanswered prayers than for our answered ones
8307195 this is the next to last step in a systematic succession plan weve had in place for some time now
8307196 but its still an announcement that comes with a lot of mixed emotions when you consider the integral role that bb amp t has played in my life for nearly 40 years now
8307197 believe me im not happy about paying 3 80 for a gallon of gasoline and i know youre not either
8307198 i concur with that view and believe current fed policy is consistent with an easing in overall inflation given the dynamics of the economy
8307199 with weak growth and financial market strains i believe the most likely outcome is that both headline and core inflation will diminish over the rest of 2008 and into next year as the temporary effects of energy and food price increases abate

8307203 our strength is often composed of the weakness were damned if were going to show
8307204 you wrote 200 tests pfffft whatever and what exactly do your 200 tests do
8307205 we are committed to ensuring that we use our position to promote socially responsible policies and practices and that we make positive contributions to society
8307206 i hope you can see how sensitive and very important the security issue is for the safe houses

8307209 apples success with consumers has begun to spill over into the enterprise market with mac adoption among enterprise customers increasing four fold in less than two years mac use in businesses rose from 1 1 percent in october 2006 to 4 5 percent in june of this year according to a report by analyst benjamin gray of forrester research released friday and made public by eweeks joe wilcox while 4 5 percent of the enterprise market may appear puny next to the nearly 95 percent held by microsofts windows it is nevertheless startling that the mac has made any headway at all in a market in which it had languished for years
8307210 its been a story of exclusion ever since he was born
8307211 when he was eight months old the doctors told us we should just put him away hed be a vegetable all his life that sort of thing well those doctors are not alive any more but i would like them to be able to see rick now
8307212 because he couldnt talk they thought he wouldnt be able to understand but that wasnt true
8307213 thats why we wanted to get him into public school
8307214 rick just cracked up they knew then that he could communicate
8307215 rick told us he just didnt feel handicapped when we were competing
8307216 what i mean when i say i feel like i am not handicapped when competing is that i am just like the other athletes and i think most of the athletes feel the same way in the beginning nobody would come up to me however after a few races some athletes came around and they began to talk to me during the early days one runner pete wisnewski had a bet with me at every race on who would beat who the loser had to hang the winners number in his bedroom until the next race now many athletes will come up to me before the race or triathlon to wish me luck
8307217 nobody wanted rick in a road race everybody looked at us nobody talked to us nobody wanted to have anything to do with us but you cant really blame them people often are not educated and theyd never seen anyone like us as time went on though they could see he was a person he has a great sense of humor for instance that made a big difference
8307218 and i hadnt been on a bike since i was six years old
8307219 we chuckle to think about that as my fathers day present from rick
8307220 rick is the one who inspires and motivates me the way he just loves sports and competing
8307221 dad is one of my role models once he sets out to do something dad sticks to it whatever it is until it is done for example once we decided to really get into triathlons dad worked out up to five hours a day five times a week even when he was working
8307222 some people have turned out some in good shape some really out of shape and they say we want to thank you because were here because of you
8307223 whenever we are passed usually on the bike the athlete will say
8307224 if not for you we would not be out here doing this
8307225 people just need to be educated rick is helping many other families coping with disabilities in their struggle to be included
8307226 in restaurants and its only older people mostly theyll see ricks food being pushed out of his mouth and theyll leave or change their table but i have to say that kind of intolerance is gradually being defeated
8307227 on the day of the marathon from hopkinton to boston people all over the course were wishing me luck and they had signs up which read
8307228 the message of team hoyt is that everybody should be included in everyday life

8307244 the tories have again shown they are in the pocket of vested interests of big business and not on the side of ordinary parents and consumers what parents want is more support and information about the impact of the food their children are eating the tories want to hide that information to suit the interests of the food industry
8307245 lots of warm words but with very little policy substance
8307246 everyone believes that individual responsibility matters but the tories are using individual responsibility as an excuse for their lack of effective policies in this area
8307247 w labour matters is supportive of labour but not an official labour party publication
8307248 we always aim to hire the two best drivers available and we always then aim to give them equal opportunities to optimise their chances to win grands prix and world championships
8307249 sometimes that policy has been criticised by those who believe that a policy of running a number one driver supported by a number two driver with or without team orders is a better strategy well we dont accept that we exist to win and all our employees including all our drivers buy in to that
8307250 id describe them as competitive and co operative in equal measure which is exactly what every team wants from its driver line up
8307251 everyone at arsenal would like to wish philippe the very best for the coming season and his time with ac milan
8307252 created a stir when he pledged that the conservatives would give the vote to all women over the age of twenty one a pledge which thus had to be honoured in 1928
8307253 hes coming on all right and we are hopeful of getting him there obviously he wont get a run before the leger
8307254 we spoke to the players when we met up originally and spoke about 17 points from the group
8307255 its not about one or two games its about the whole campaign
8307256 we are very focused we have two tough away games we have had macedonia watched on a few occasions and they did very well in their last game against luxembourg
8307257 they are a good team and they have nine of the players who played against england in 2006 and they beat croatia 2 0 in 2007 at home so its going to be a very difficult game but thats the world cup
8307258 its the biggest competition every country in the world takes part and its an exciting time
8307259 we have to go in there with belief and give it our best shot to try to qualify
8307260 weve had a good look at it ive got a good idea of my team formation the way we are going to play
8307261 o give thanks to the lord for he is good and his mercy endures forever
8307262 it is better to trust in the lord than to put our confidence in man
8307263 did i see a spark of something in that mans eyes
8307264 it was just before the passover feast jesus knew that the time had come for him to leave this world and go to the father having loved his own who were in the world he now showed them the full extent of his love so he got up from the meal took off his out er clothing and wrapped a towel around his waist after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples feet
8307265 open to me the gates of righteousness and i will go through them and i will praise the lord
8307266 ronaldinho ignored all the chinese and walked straight towards me he looked me deep in the eyes took my hand and kissed it i almost fainted
8307267 somebody said in broken english that he was calling on behalf of ronaldinho ronaldinho wanted me to come up to his room unfortunately he cant speak much english my spanish and portuguese are appalling and so the conversation consisted of mostly sign language an interpreter said that ronaldinho asked if i would like to marry him i was shocked and immediately replied no
8307268 i have my adam here at home although it took some time to placate him after i told him about the meeting with the brazilians
8307269 i love the premier league and i would certainly like to play there however if i go to england i would want to play for arsenal or chelsea
8307270 im sooooooooo happy as a spurs fan that this 3 game star is distancing himself away from spurs because hes nothing im happy to see how dos santos and bent get on rather than waste money on a russian
8307271 if we dont get anybody well have to wait for everybody to come back and this could take some time
8307272 mark vidukas four or five weeks away and obafemi martins is out for three or four weeks as is damien duff
8307273 the young back up weve got in andy carroll and kazenga lualua is also injured
8307274 at a smaller club thats okay but not here alan smiths also injured so weve been hit hard you cant legislate for that you could sign about 10 strikers but when theyre all fit youve got a problem
8307275 i screwed it up every way you could screw it up
8307276 today we i we win as a team and lose as a team but tonight you can put it on me
8307277 thats one of the guys you want in those situations
8307278 ill be here early tomorrow and ill get my four or five at bats
8307279 you are an enemy of the daleks you must be destroyed
8307280 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure where its heading
8307281 for that reason everyone in gulf needs to be monitoring the storm at that point were expecting it to be a category 3 hurricane
8307282 combined with the deep warm waters rapid intensification could occur in a couple of days
8307283 my instinct is it will be a really wet night
8307284 they were all members of a family that had taken shelter since tropical storm fay and left to go home because they thought the danger had passed
8307285 at the moment christian nade is one of our most professional players
8307286 he stays on the training field and takes time to improve
8307287 i am so happy about my team at the moment they understand what i need what i like mr romanov calls me and tells me do it make it
8307288 this is important to have the protection and to feel it
8307289 at the moment i am very satisfied i am unhappy about a lot of things but not unsatisfied
8307290 if no one else is speaking english hows he going to fit in as the director of our offense
8307291 our findings suggest that increased brain connections during chronic drug use may actually limit behavioral changes associated with drug addiction rather than support them
8307292 relapse or the resumption of active drug taking and drug seeking is very common in drug addicts
8307293 addiction related brain changes and behaviors seem to be hardwired and semipermanent and there are limited treatment options our data suggest that rather than trying to block the process of increasing dendritic spine density we may actually want to look at treatments that try to enhance this process
8307294 this suggests the exciting possibility that mef2 proteins may control expression of key genes that modulate drug related brain changes and behavior
8307295 if we understand which genes are influenced by mef2 we can intervene and try to help the system resist or reverse these sensitization processes
8307296 on behalf of all the members of the aacr and the cancer research community at large i would like to express our deep appreciation to dr rebbeck for accepting this very important post
8307297 dr rebbeck is a world renowned scientist and epidemiologist lauded for his extraordinary accomplishments in molecular and genetic epidemiology of common cancers
8307298 clearly he is the ideal individual to be the editor in chief of this important peer reviewed journal which is devoted to the publication of the most important studies in cancer causation mechanisms of carcinogenesis prevention and survivorship
8307299 we look forward to working with dr rebbeck to bring the findings published in this journal rapidly to the benefit of cancer patients around the world

8307342 el consejo noratl ntico condena la decisi n de la federaci n rusa de extender el reconocimiento a las regiones georgianas de osetia del sur y abjazia y pide a rusia que revoque su decisi n
8307343 argumentamos constantemente que ser a imposible despu s de esto decirle a los abjasos y osetas y decenas de otros grupos en todo el mundo que lo que era bueno para los albano kosovares no era bueno para ellos en las relaciones internacionales no se puede tener una regla para unos y otra para otros

8307359 os deputados e senadores levam a fama mas a maioria dos projetos relat rios e pronunciamentos apresentados no congresso nacional n o s o de autoria dos parlamentares nem de seus assessores diretos
8307360 o senador pode apresentar o projeto que ele quiser at um para revogar a lei da gravidade a gente faz mas entrega junto uma nota t cnica alertando que ele pode ser ridicularizado que a comunidade cient fica provavelmente vai contestar por se tratar de uma lei muito importante ele pode seguir nossa orienta o e abandonar o projeto ou insistir e apresentar mesmo assim isso fica a cargo dele
8307361 o projeto chegou bem cru pra gente um dos nossos melhores consultores analisou e argumentou com o senador ramez tebet relator do projeto na casa que do jeito que estava a proposta n o ia mudar nada ia causar ainda mais confus o
8307362 o dif cil foi o senador convencer o l der do governo e o minist rio da fazenda de que as mudan as eram necess rias porque como o senado uma casa revisora com as mudan as o projeto teve de voltar para a c mara para ser votado mais uma vez o que levou mais tempo mas o resultado foi uma lei bem mais completa

8307387 its sad that the money raised was through someones funeral but it has raised the awareness among the community and young women its a really good legacy to carry on with
8307388 in recognition of this and in memory of belinda the two positions will be known as the emmett mcgrath breast care nurses

8307390 reports of strong support within john mccains presidential campaign for independent democratic sen
8307391 we are investigating a matter which relates to a police officer and were still investigating
8307392 we had concerns about his behaviour and weve then looked to investigate that matter
8307393 so at the moment were still collecting evidence and well talk with the director of public prosecutions about the way we might go forward
8307394 many officers exercise that discretion in a number of ways
8307395 what we require of our officers when they do that though is that they are open and transparent
8307396 we have a variety of ways we find out about officers behaving badly

8307402 heil f hrt dieses medium mit seinen nichts sagenden klischeehaften bis peinlichen kurzkommentaren recht ad absurdum
8307403 dass sie langeweile verbreiten kann man von heils twitter eintr gen jedenfalls nicht behaupten
8307404 twitter ist nat rlich nicht geeignet um schwere programmatische aussagen zu treffen
8307405 aber es ist ein sehr schnelles medium mit dem man schnell aufmerksamkeit bekommen kann
8307406 die steigende zahl an absolventen weist nicht auf eine gr ere durchl ssigkeit im bildungssystem hin
8307407 i thought it was freaky my glasses were everywhere it was exciting definitely one of the higher exposure projects ive been on
8307408 i used to work at cbc television in the maintenance department
8307409 what it did for me is i was able to look at a lot of career options
8307410 for the first four years of my career i worked at fraiman design the owner was whyle fraiman he was a great mentor because hes very focused on good design and on the fundamental things a lot of companies tend to sell out
8307411 its a multi disciplinary agency which makes it more interesting
8307412 theres something new every week he explains many graphic artists get bored working on the same accounts all the time
8307413 im constantly looking at things its a form of expression of myself within this sometimes i take it a little too personally its an artistic outlet for me ive been fortunate but ive worked friggin hard as well its a very cut throat industry in all honesty many companies dont treat you very well
8307414 it puts things in perspective for me unfortunately a lot of things get lost here peoples values get a little messed up when in a condensed urban environment
8307415 what drivers dont realize is that ethanol is one third less energy per gallon
8307416 so if i have a gallon of gas sitting here and a gallon of ethanol im going to get more energy out of a gallon of gas than on a gallon of ethanol
8307417 virtually every car on the road runs on e10 just fine with no problems whatsoever
8307418 you can immediately go to 14 billion gallons of ethanol without having to worry about infrastructure concerns like the cars engine or gas pumps or anything like that
8307419 so if you have a non ffv and you pump it into your vehicle youre going to have a very serious large expense in front of you to the tune of thousands of dollars vehicles that dont run on e85 if you do pump it into those vehicles the problem is it will corrode the fuel lines the tank the fuel pump destroy the fuel filter etc
8307420 if you are comparing performance and that kind of stuff e85 is an extremely high performance fuel and thats why the indy racing league runs exclusively on ethanol
8307421 today ethanol is becoming far more of a viable alternative to gasoline as will other technologies like hybrids and plug in hybrids and all of this other stuff that will come its ethanol that is the first foot in the door
8307422 the energy crisis is this country today is such that we cant afford to take any options off the table biofuels and ethanol in particular offer us a very logical and a very easy first step
8307423 allah yang maha pemurah serta melimpah rahmat nya dialah yang mengajarkan al quran dialah yang menciptakan manusia dialah yang membolehkan manusia memberi dan menerima pernyataan
8307424 daripada kebaikan iman seseorang ialah meninggalkan apa yang tidak bermakna baginya
8307425 sesungguhnya berjayalah orang yang beriman iaitu mereka yang khusyuk dalam solatnya dan mereka yang menjauhkan diri daripada perbuatan dan perkataan sia sia
8307426 sesungguhnya orang mengutuk tidak boleh menjadi saksi dan memberi pertolongan bagi saudaranya pada hari kiamat
8307427 ada seorang lelaki berkata demi allah allah tidak akan memberikan pengampunan kepada si polan itu allah bersabda yang bermaksud siapakah yang berani bersumpah atas nama ku bahawa aku tidak akan mengampuni si polan itu sesungguhnya aku sudah mengampuni orang itu dan aku menghapuskan pahala amalanmu yakni yang bersumpah tadi
8307428 tidakkah kamu perhatikan bagaimana allah membuat contoh ucapan yang baik mengajak berbuat baik menjauhi perbuatan salah seperti sebatang pohon yang baik subur akar kuat terjunam ke dalam tanah dan cabangnya menjulang tinggi ke langit pohon itu berbuah terus dengan izin tuhannya allah menjadikan contoh itu untuk manusia supaya mereka ingat selalu dan contoh perkataan yang buruk seperti memfitnah berdusta mengajak berbuat mungkar dan lain lain seperti pohon yang busuk mati yang tercabut akarnya dari permukaan bumi tidak tegak berdiri lagi
8307429 tidaklah seorang melemparkan kefasikan atau kekufuran kepada orang lain melainkan akan kembalilah kefasikan atau kekufuran itu pada dirinya sendiri jika yang dikatakan sedemikian itu bukan yang memiliki sifat berkenaan

8307434 i made clear that i would have expected that one would discuss the issue in the organization for security and cooperation in europe osce or in the un security council before unilateral recognition
8307435 russias unilateral decision to redraw the borders of georgia is unacceptable
8307436 russia is not yet reconciled to the new map of this region
8307437 unilateral attempt to redraw the map marks a moment of real significance
8307438 the russian president says he is not afraid of a new cold war we dont want one he has a big responsibility not to start one
8307439 russias decision violates the many un security council resolutions it has endorsed regarding georgias territorial integrity and is inconsistent with the fundamental osce principles on which stability in europe is based
8307440 i sincerely hope that the georgian people will one day have leaders they deserve who care about their country and who develop mutually respectful relations with all the peoples in the caucasus

8307443 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure where its heading
8307444 for that reason everyone in gulf needs to be monitoring the storm at that point were expecting it to be a category 3 hurricane
8307445 combined with the deep warm waters rapid intensification could occur in a couple of days
8307446 my instinct is it will be a really wet night
8307447 they were all members of a family that had taken shelter since tropical storm fay and left to go home because they thought the danger had passed
8307448 down the road we will be looking at what may be required to rebuild the georgian military
8307449 right now the mission of the united states military is to provide humanitarian assistance
8307450 the danger is letting the russians think they can get away with this and do it again in ukraine or someplace else they have to realize that theyre not going to get a free ride
8307451 its physically impossible for us to do enough to deter the russians from further incursions so its not clear to me that military aid would be appreciably more than symbolic
8307452 its hard to imagine that the united states would embark on the process of rearming georgia until the conflict has reached a stable equilibrium that at least has the possibility of triggering some kind of military confrontation between the u s and russia
8307453 the six point ceasefire agreement of aug 12 which bears the signatures of russian president dmitry medvedev and georgian president mikheil saakashvili and mine must be applied in full
8307454 the military forces which have not yet withdrawn to the lines preceding the launch of hostilities must move without delay
8307455 this decision which aims to change georgias borders unilaterally is simply unacceptable
8307456 with irish prime minister brian cowen we will identify the guarantees that can enable europe to pass this new stage in its construction
8307457 i tell our irish friends that we need them that europe needs them that we respect them but that they must also hear the call of all other europeans who want institutions for europe
8307458 we spoke to the players when we met up originally and spoke about 17 points from the group
8307459 its not about one or two games its about the whole campaign
8307460 we are very focused we have two tough away games we have had macedonia watched on a few occasions and they did very well in their last game against luxembourg
8307461 they are a good team and they have nine of the players who played against england in 2006 and they beat croatia 2 0 in 2007 at home so its going to be a very difficult game but thats the world cup
8307462 its the biggest competition every country in the world takes part and its an exciting time
8307463 we have to go in there with belief and give it our best shot to try to qualify
8307464 weve had a good look at it ive got a good idea of my team formation the way we are going to play
8307465 we needed to strengthen our defence and anton is a great signing
8307466 hes still young but he has over 160 games under his belt so he has experience hes learning his trade
8307467 it was hard leaving west ham because i have been there for 16 years but after meeting roy keane i knew it was time for a change
8307468 i have one more player in mind and then that is the end of it for a few months at least
8307469 the bloodshed in the global motorcar industry may well get much worse before picking up sometime in 2009 this could not come at worse time for zinc
8307470 the collapse in zinc prices is belated but justified miners are still ramping up production while we are probably still 200 t away from a rash of suspended output

8307473 were playing a lot of young guys were probably going to have three freshman on the offensive line nobody wants to be in that position we have a quarterback with no experience and we have new receivers we have to shorten the game and play great defense
8307474 we would like to thank these people for referring at least x amount of customers this year we appreciate your business and support
8307475 i thought it was freaky my glasses were everywhere it was exciting definitely one of the higher exposure projects ive been on

8307483 although harvest is taking a long time to come in at least 80 of what weve seen so far is decent marketable quality
8307484 there are some pre germination and hagberg problems coming through but theyre nowhere near as bad as they could have been as crop maturity was a bit later than last year
8307485 im pretty sure some of the buying being done in the south will go by boat to scotland they have a strong demand for distilling barley varieties like optic and proportionally the scottish crop has taken a lot more damage than ours in the south

8307497 were delighted to be sponsoring the prestigious pocket lint gadget awards again this year we know many of our customers like not only the latest mobiles but a variety of gadgets so its very approriate that we should be associated with awards that cover such a wide range of nominations
8307498 this is the 5th year of the pocket lint gadget awards and its great to have vodafone on board
8307499 the awards are not only believed to be the longest running in the uk but also the fairest as we actually ask the opinions of our competition to help out with the judging rather than just picking who we fancy winning

8307553 this lawsuit is a poorly disguised attempt to deflect attention away from the primary cause of the decline of the sacramento san joaquin delta estuary
8307554 the truth is that the massive increase in the diversion of water in recent years has accelerated the crash of the delta fisheries although many factors such as pollution urban development and invasive species affect the delta excessive water diversion is the leading cause of the decline in the fisheries
8307555 delta smelt salmon and striped bass have successfully co existed in this ecosystem for more than a century there is no evidence that recent population declines of either delta smelt or chinook salmon resulted from predation by striped bass whose numbers have also collapsed
8307556 in contrast there is strong scientific evidence that dams water diversions pollution and the collapse of the planktonic food web in the upper estuary are harming all the fishes that rely on the bay delta
8307557 delta smelt and chinook salmon have shown continuous long term declines since the 1960s and 1970s when the state and federal water projects began exporting water and striped bass have shown the same decline
8307558 there has been no evidence of a classic predator prey relationship no reputable scientist has pinned the crash of smelt and salmon on the striped bass
8307559 although they claim to care about the ecological health of the delta the so called coalition for a sustainable delta is most interested in maintaining their historic allotment of taxpayer subsidized water exports their efforts to blame striped bass are ridiculous and a desperate move
8307560 we hope they will focus their attention on the real issues affecting the health of the delta compared to the alleged striped bass predation issue there are hundreds of more important issues affecting salmon and smelt in this once great estuary
8307561 im certain the endangered species act was never designed to decimate an important recreational asset like the west coast striped bass fishery and remove its status as a sport fish
8307562 yet thats exactly what will happen if the irrigators prevail in this lawsuit
8307563 i hate to think of all the tackle shop owners marinas and fishing guides that will be unnecessarily harmed if the coalition for a sustainable delta wins this suit
8307564 blaming striped bass for the decline of endangered bay delta fisheries is yet another devious plot of the water grabbers who comprise the coalition for a sustainable delta it is obvious the coalition considers the striped bass to be a roadblock for claiming more northern water
8307565 they should put their efforts toward addressing the real problems that have adversely affected delta smelt and chinook salmon if the coalition is successful in their greedy attack it will signal the end of a great fishery for many individuals and families and for many young and old anglers who love the thrill of catching a striped bass

8307990 the reduced forcing might compensate or over compensate for the effects of the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases
8307991 it is likely that there will be a cessation of around 20 years in the increase in world temperature or possibly a decrease by 0 1 degrees or more
8307992 natural solar variability is potentially important but the climate history and physics tell us that the probability of this factor sufficiently cooling the planet to offset the enhanced greenhouse effect is distinctly remote
8307993 i have never seen a credible paper published using a climate model that shows this
8307994 i believe that we must state firmly that a cooling is possible in the near future but that the warming would then resume 10 20 years hence
8307995 it will be very hard to argue for public trust if we say nothing about the possibility and then try to argue our way out after it happens using an aussie rules analogy that would be like giving the climate sceptics a free kick 10m in front of goal

8308002 i have never seen a credible paper published using a climate model
8308003 points to recent data which indicates that global temperatures are probably rising faster than previously thought
8308004 in his recent book on human evolution for example professor stephen oppenheimer suggests that human induced warming is already counteracting a return to ice age conditions the simplistic assumption would be that if 4 deg of anthropogenic global warming coincided with 4 deg of natural cooling over say a century or so the two would simply cancel each other out though of course the story might be more complex than that

8308163 she said as she curled up in a ball on the bed they were a couple we met on the second day but there was no way golf would be as much fun as all the watching i had been doing i wondered if my cum hungry wife would need some different cocks tomorrow maybe i could help her find some i myself slept for just a few hours getting up at the crack of dawn i called down to the concierge to set up a surprise for my little slut of a wife at 8 00 am she would get a knock at the door and enjoy a nice relaxing massage from one of the staff first i would warm her up to it with some gentle caressing to wake her up sliding my fingers across her back rubbing her ass getting her to moan for attention until finally she would turn from her side to her back spreading her legs in the process a very nice sign that she was getting very turned on and then gently sliding my fingers over the pussy lips she was wet already as i eased a finger between those hot lips i had to make this quick so i climbed down between her legs and gave her a few choice licks to get her attention then as i planned the phone rang for our wake up call she pouted up at me as she reached down to slide a finger in her pussy i said i better go we can continue later she had an appointment soon i told her i called debbie and told her she would meet her for breakfast to go take a shower and cool off for now then i leaned over and got one last lick in from her fingers to taste that sweet juice from her pussy even letting my tongue slide down to that sweet puckered asshole of her for a fast swipe she turned over in frustration as i grabbed my clubs and went out the door grinning knowing that she would need to do something to feed her early morning hunger i called the room about five minutes to 8 00 to tell her to get up and shower and to let her know that debbie might be late but i arranged a special surprise for her she wanted to know what but i told her to shower she would know soon enough i rushed back to the suite and to the porch outside so i could get to see if horny little wife would take the bait she hadnt even got out of bed yet when i first peeked through the window after rolling over to see the clock a few times she did move to get up i didnt realize it at first but she must have been still rubbing her pussy the way she sat up and shook her head and arched her back said her was wide awake and she walked over to the bathroom again i heard the water running and she must have been showering just a minute later there was a loud knock on the suite door and a few seconds later my wife came out of the bathroom with her robe on and was drying her hair with a towel she asked who it was and a heavy accented voice answered back
8308164 can you give me another towel please i need to cover my you know behind
8308165 i still have some wonderful oils to use on you they will loosen up your body and make everything irie
8308166 and i watched as she propped herself up on her elbows never taking her eyes off that bulge just a foot away from her face

8308171 she groaned as his thick cock head parted those dripping wet lips
8308172 she grabbed behind her knees raising her ass to accommodate that huge piece of black meat he wasted no time burying that cock in her she was rotating her hips as he fucked that cock into her
8308173 cumming on that big cock all over that black cock yes
8308174 her ass was meeting his powerful thrusts they got faster and faster harder and harder he pumped that wet cunt
8308175 oh thats it im cumming on that dick again shoot that cum in me now cum in me as i cum on that big cock of yours please

8308181 men of this kind who take a womans virginity without intending to marry her are inwardly murderers they undergo very severe punishment in the next life it seems to them as though they are seated on a horse that is frenzied which tosses them up in the air so that they are thrown from the horse and their life seemingly put in peril such is the terror struck into them after that it appears to them as though they are under the belly of the frenzied horse and then it seems to them as though they pass by way of the horses hindquarters into its belly at this point it suddenly seems to them as if they are inside the belly of a filthy prostitute the prostitute changes into a large dragon and there they stay enveloped in torment this punishment is repeated many times over hundreds and thousand of years until they are filled with horror for such desires

8308195 its always good to see an arizona governor talking about our state on the national stage but she conveniently left out the circumstances of our states billion dollar budget deficit the fact is that barack obamas celebrity status is not going to help arizonans or any americans at all we dont need his higher taxes more government spending and his desire to separate us from the rest of the global economy

8308201 i was treated like a criminal and i didnt understand why i was being treated like that
8308202 an important factor in this case is that this woman had been previously deported from this country and she ignored that order and came back
8308203 we are outraged and heartbroken for the treatment of juana at the hands of the officers who were involved we urge our communities across the state to grieve with us and respond in prayer and political action to work towards repair and reform of the immigration laws of our state and nation

8308306 what drivers dont realize is that ethanol is one third less energy per gallon
8308307 so if i have a gallon of gas sitting here and a gallon of ethanol im going to get more energy out of a gallon of gas than on a gallon of ethanol
8308308 virtually every car on the road runs on e10 just fine with no problems whatsoever
8308309 you can immediately go to 14 billion gallons of ethanol without having to worry about infrastructure concerns like the cars engine or gas pumps or anything like that
8308310 so if you have a non ffv and you pump it into your vehicle youre going to have a very serious large expense in front of you to the tune of thousands of dollars vehicles that dont run on e85 if you do pump it into those vehicles the problem is it will corrode the fuel lines the tank the fuel pump destroy the fuel filter etc
8308311 if you are comparing performance and that kind of stuff e85 is an extremely high performance fuel and thats why the indy racing league runs exclusively on ethanol
8308312 today ethanol is becoming far more of a viable alternative to gasoline as will other technologies like hybrids and plug in hybrids and all of this other stuff that will come its ethanol that is the first foot in the door
8308313 the energy crisis is this country today is such that we cant afford to take any options off the table biofuels and ethanol in particular offer us a very logical and a very easy first step

8308597 we always aim to hire the two best drivers available and we always then aim to give them equal opportunities to optimise their chances to win grands prix and world championships
8308598 sometimes that policy has been criticised by those who believe that a policy of running a number one driver supported by a number two driver with or without team orders is a better strategy well we dont accept that we exist to win and all our employees including all our drivers buy in to that
8308599 id describe them as competitive and co operative in equal measure which is exactly what every team wants from its driver line up

8308621 we saw all the destruction and we just knew we had to come back
8308622 this experience has caused me to look at material things differently when i think how we have struggled to come up with money to pay for a foundation when i have a rug on my floor at home that would more than cover it

8308670 theres an amount of risk involved in leases where we see the used car market were a little more exposed we certainly remain committed to leasing but we are trying to shift
8308671 they might not be as aggressive and payments may go up a little bit but its such a main part of the selling strategy for luxury vehicles i dont see how they could abandon leasing and expect to do any volumes

8308678 paola has the beauty and sexuality necessary to portray my initial vision of night trips but up dated to 2009
8308679 i started a trend back then giving a lot of companies creative ideas that have continued to this day in an industry that has left film behind in favor of video production i started shooting on film and will continue to shoot on film for years to come shooting film gives the images a one step removed quality that cant be duplicated in hd video remember that film is the original 100 year old high definition media
8308680 this project is ground breaking a phenomenon he is a visionary an artist i learned from andrew that porn is not all about being filthy and nasty but the subtle ability to turn someone on
8308681 the point the creativity of our vision isnt the only creativity that matters the creativity of our design and execution also matters moreover by being constrained the latter type of creativity becomes more and more important
8308682 but we still manage to keep up with the demand
8308683 we are looking at the possibility of sending our people to these foreign suppliers so that they can be trained to provide the same kind of service that we offer
8308684 in issue 26 caretakers previously unseen granddaughter sara leaves the nunnery where she was raised to track down the grandfather she never knew she had
8308685 interesting timing wouldnt you say sara is an all new character and one that well be seeing a lot more of in the coming months
8308686 but also just so he could gloat about how danny has fallen from the side of the good guys blackouts cruel like that
8308687 as you can tell hes not too thrilled about it
8308688 but hes just doing what he feels like he must
8308689 there will be more new villains yes but well also eventually see the return of some more old favorites
8308690 caretaker always seemed pretty integral to the ghost rider mythos back in the 90s series and since were doing something now that really dramatically alters what readers think they know about the spirit of vengeance it only seemed fitting that caretaker would return to pass his mantle on to someone new
8308691 with danny ketch running through a magic door and johnny blaze giving chase and what revelations await them on the other side you wont believe oh and theyll also be beating the living crap out of each other too

8308696 if you are really interested in a hybrid which many people are there are several pros and cons you will really want to consider before you buy
8308697 one benefit is that hybrids obviously average better gas mileage than conventional gas vehicles however they are usually a couple thousand dollars more expensive and can take a few years to recoup the premium paid for them
8308698 due to limited supplies new hybrids are difficult to find consumers are sometimes required to make a deposit to be added to the end of a waiting list people interested in driving a hybrid should consider purchasing a used hybrid
8308699 to help find that perfect used car id recommend people look for an auto retailer with services that let you know when certain vehicles become available such as carmax coms inventory alert system and allows you to transfer used cars from one store to another
8308700 there are many vehicles that provide fuel efficiency beyond just hybrids
8308701 there are a number of non hybrid cars that can get more than 30mpg on the highway and we have the expertise and tools available to help people find a more gas friendly car
8308702 well keep doing it until we find the right way

8308713 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose

8308716 an inner quality that many entrepreneurs say helps them survive is optimism
8308717 it was such a huge part of us growing up and making us who we are and it was heartbreaking to think it wouldnt be there for other kids

8308719 ican changed my perception on ways to live especially stress
8308720 i came back talking to everyone about it i cant wait to go back this year
8308721 its pretty crazy how close you get with people just from one week of camp
8308722 once and for all the yankees need their biggest players to play that way against boston and set up what still has the chance to be a memorable and dramatic september it starts with a rod who so far this season has been nothing more than a gaudy numbers hanger and a tabloid dream
8308723 was not a step taken lightly or without full consideration of the consequences
8308724 relations between nations living under one roof need to be handled with the utmost sensitivity

8308726 immediately stripped its autonomous regions of abkhazia and south ossetia of their autonomy
8308727 fears and aspirations of the south ossetian and abkhazian peoples
8308728 the continued russian presence in georgia outside of abkhazia and south ossetia for example in poti represents a significant violation of the six point plan agreement
8308729 we cannot accept these violations of international law of accords for security and cooperation in europe of united nations resolutions and the taking of a territory by the army of a neighboring country

8308732 bad politicians are sent to washington by good people who dont vote
8308733 sen obama and sen mccain have been focusing on pocketbook issues like 4 gas global warming and security issues like energy independence now the auto industrys financial crisis has their attention
8308734 it may seem like the candidates positions are closely aligned but they actually have radically different approaches to cafe the vehicle technologies they champion and the support theyre willing to lend to automakers
8308735 plug ins are the holy grail for fuel economy because they can be driven extended distances on battery power alone and deliver in theory more than 100 miles per gallon
8308736 however major players in the industry disagree if plug ins are the answer theres also the question if 4 billion for r amp d and 7 000 incentives for consumers will be enough to perfect plug ins and other technologies put them into mass production and make the vehicles affordable for consumers on an accelerated timetable
8308737 promises made on the campaign trail have a way of moderating if the candidate gets elected but its clear that a president obama will use a carrot and stick approach to force the industry to become as green as possible and do it faster than they may be able to contain
8308738 while sen mccains endorsement of loan guarantees r amp d tax credits and consumer incentives show support for the industry his proposal to enforce cafe rather than increase it may be more important in the long run
8308739 the industry is making massive investments on borrowed money to meet the stringent fuel economy targets already on the books and they need to strive for a return on their capital increasing cafe would only increase the risks facing the industry
8308740 the cost of complying with todays fuel economy regulations alone will make cars more expensive to buy in coming years and the inflation in vehicle prices will likely outpace wage growth between now and 2014
8308741 consumers will respond by buying smaller vehicles keeping their cars and trucks longer and financing them for seven or eight years
8308742 these and other factors are going to keep industry volumes and profits under pressure
8308743 this reality may be what prompted sen mccain to reconsider loan guarantees for detroit and it may eventually lead sen obama to scale back his calls for a technology revolution or at least offer more assistance to achieve it
8308744 this award is a step towards solidifying iac as a leading investor with minority suppliers

8308778 this research reinforces why state farm is actively involved in advocating for laws that help prevent injuries and deaths resulting from motor vehicle crashes its clear from these findings that primary seat belt laws for all occupants would help us accomplish that goal

8308786 i actually think its inevitable twenty20 cricket will be an olympic sport
8308787 you think about the audiences in the sub continent 22 or 23 percent of the worlds population is based in that area the ioc could do a lot worse than put cricket into the olympics
8308788 the critical issue with the game of twenty20 cricket is how do we make it work
8308789 we definitely need a carve out period the reason i say that is not because i want to go off and play its not about that
8308790 i want to play for australia as much as i can i want to play as many tests for australia as i can i want the next generation of australian players to have that dream to put on the baggy green cap and play 100 test matches and 300 one day games
8308791 im worried if theres not that period of time be it in the ipl or the epl or whatever competition it might be that this next generations opinions might change they might see the dollars and think maybe its more appealing to me that i go and play ipl instead of playing for my country
8308792 that would be the saddest thing ever to happen to this great game
8308793 when investigators contacted deputy rusciano by telephone deputy rusciano admitted that he had met the individual for a very brief moment at a party they both attended

8308798 the exercise also emphasized the difficulty of articulating criteria for successful design and led to a discussion about who is responsible for design in organizations the architect we can name but we dont know who designed many of the processes for example

8308803 by winning the capacity on a planned transmission line of this magnitude we believe we have added significant value to our proposed wheatland wyo wind development project
8308804 this auction and the ensuing contract we have entered into is essentially a reservation to transmit power on the wci power transmission line into a market that we believe shows very promising demand for renewable power

8308844 your browser has visited the site at least one time
8308845 i have an ip what can i do with it
8308846 persistently low fertility and an increasing number of survivors to higher ages
8308847 projections such as these are proof that we are right to be carrying out the biggest shake up to the immigration system for a generation
8308848 centre stage is our new australian style points based system which means only those we need can come here to work or study
8308849 essential we develop a coherent strategy to deal with population growth
8308850 this strategy must bring together policy on issues from the family to border control housing to skills and planning to immigration control
8308851 we not only need to ensure that our population grows at a more sustainable rate but that we also prepare properly for that sustainable rate of growth
8308852 the government have shown that they have no answers to the challenges we face by failing to plan for our increasing population this makes them part of the problem not the solution
8308853 population statistics are predicted by using recent figures so this report will have used the statistics of immigration in the uk in the last few years the level is high so the prediction will be high
8308854 there are signs that immigration in this country is starting to tail off if you were to do this again in 2010 or 2011 i think it would be different
8308855 the japanese governments commitment to afghan reconstruction and the war on terror will never change
8308856 when we felt the application was ready to be launched
8308857 we made the strategic decision to seek a partner who could help us with financing marketing and the general business structure
8308858 we will not be selling woopra at this early stage
8308859 we are still the owners i cannot enter into too many details at this moment as the program has only just been launched all i can say is that we have a very decent amount of funds compared to other start up projects like facebook or youtube
8308860 i then started learning about other tracking and analytics services and discovered success measuring methods other than just number of hits per day
8308861 by 2005 i realized that everything on the web was moving toward socializing and social networking everything except my analytics services google analytics still only offers numbers and statistics that wasnt enough for me i wanted to know more about who is viewing what on my virtual property whos stumbling on it how did they know about it was it possible to get in contact with them and perhaps even guide them
8308862 thats basically where i lived for a year for months we worked non stop often more than 15 hours per day sometimes we would finish work at 5am and join our friends for breakfast when they came back from a night out in batroun it didnt really bother us but i must admit our social life was totally screwed up
8308863 i dont think it is the task of a university to offer support for a project like woopra
8308864 the main role of the lau was teaching us the basics discipline and methodology a couple of teachers really supported us especially my supervisor dr munjid musallem what lebanese universities lack is the ability to make entrepreneurs they always prepare you to work in a company our universities are generally producing employees instead of creating long term inspirational projects
8308865 we have the worst internet connection in the middle east which is terrible yet this helped us to tackle the worst case scenarios and debug our code easier
8308866 this is not a compliment it is a shame really that at times we had to use a dial up modem because all the alternatives were down for days we had major problems rolling updates it used to take 4 to 6 hours to roll an update while in the us it takes less than five minutes the government has promised the adsl lines for 3 years yet we are still not able to set up an adsl account in byblos
8308867 throughout his first semester elie told me about his ideas that would later shape up to become woopra
8308868 woopra was elies brainchild and his primary obsession no one could have stopped him from pursuing his woopra side discussions about woopra were regular and naturally it was the subject of elies final graduation capstone project
8308869 jad clearly stood out when he presented the tradeoffs of client server versus multi tier and peer to peer design which is very important in the software architectures to which woopra subscribes
8308870 in short i consider myself the lucky teacher of two software gurus
8308871 the same happened with google yahoo mosaic the predecessor of netscape and many other products
8308872 but realistically some critical technologies do not take off until us based organizations give it their blessing and join in
8308873 there is much more technical expertise vision and entrepreneurial support in the usa than in any other place the database industry oracle sql server db2 is almost entirely located in the us even though many innovative database ideas have been emerging in europe for a very long time
8308874 we have a couple of drafts that we are trying to merge but we cannot reveal any further details for marketing and business reasons at this stage jad and i will continue development to keep woopra ahead of the competition while moving back and forth between lebanon and the us
8308875 sometimes we would finish work at 5am and join our friends for breakfast when they came back from a night out in batroun it didnt really bother us but i must admit our social life was totally screwed up

8308885 i am impressed and the spirit leads me thus and so true i believe all that is written and taught but i tell you that brother brigham does not tell us all of it he says he does not but that he tells us as fast as we can understand and practice what he does teach

8308888 the iphone cannot access flash or java features that are essential to some

8308891 this raises an interesting issue of where do you draw the line between essential and non essential features of websites what should the web look like should government authorities be the ones making that decision

8308913 people may be making a little more money in comparison with the poverty line but in terms of real money people can use to better themselves to buy insurance or provide more for their families thats not there

8308933 by all measures those of us americans not in the top 1 percent of income earners are under enormous economic pressure and most of us feel powerless to influence those who act in our name public attitudes toward washington are reaching record levels of animosity a scripps howard news service poll in 2006 found a majority of americans saying they personally are more angry at the government than they used to be and theres a growing backlash against the hostile takeover of our government by big money interests its the natural reaction from a country that is watching its pocket get picked

8308977 demonstrates the central paradox of portfolio diversification obviously a concentrated portfolio maximizes your chance of a superb result unfortunately at the same time it also maximizes your chance of a poor result this issue gets to the heart of why we invest you can have two possible goals one is to maximize your chances of getting rich i e active management the other is to minimize your odds of failing to meet your goals i e indexing it is important to realize that these goals are mutually exclusive

8309077 dr eyring how many of these gentlemen believe in a supreme being
8309078 which best expresses your point of view that there is a supreme being or that there is not a supreme being
8309079 well dr eyring they tell me that what you do is put religion in one compartment and your science in another isnt that inconvenient for instance i want to propound a question to you in the young womens journal is reported to have said that people are living on the moon
8309080 now dr eyring we know there is no oxygen on the moon so that couldnt possibly be true what do you say to this question
8309081 for none of these iniquities come of the lord for he doeth that which is good among the children of men and he doeth nothing save it be plain unto the children of men and
8309082 for behold the lord doth grant unto all nations of their own nation and tongue to teach his word yea in wisdom all that he seeth fit that they should have therefore we see that the lord doth counsel in wisdom according to that which is just and true
8309083 and set in order the churches and study and learn and
8309084 there is a love from god that should be exercised toward those of our faith who walk uprightly which is peculiar to itself but it is without prejudice
8309085 god raises up wise men and prophets here and there among all the children of men of their own tongue and nationality speaking to them through means that they can comprehend not always giving a fulness of truth such as may be found in the fulness of the gospel of jesus christ but always giving that measure of truth that the people are prepared to receive
8309086 other good and great men not bearing the priesthood but possessing profundity of thought great wisdom and a desire to uplift their fellows have been sent by the almighty into many nations to give them not the fullness of the gospel but that portion of truth that they were able to receive and wisely use

8309088 how did serving a mission draw me closer to god
8309089 assuredly my lord will give you a sign of his own accord look the young woman is with child and about to give birth to a son let her name him immanuel
8309090 behold the virgin whom thou seest is the mother of the son of god after the manner of the flesh
8309091 therefore the lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and shall bear a son and shall call his name immanuel
8309092 shall be born of mary at jerusalem which is the land of our forefathers she being a virgin a precious and chosen vessel who shall be overshadowed and conceive by the power of the holy ghost and bring forth a son yea even the son of god
8309093 this matter was a little changed in the case of the savior of the world the son of the living god the man joseph the husband of mary did not that we know of have more than one wife but mary the wife of joseph had another husband on this account infidels have called the savior a bastard
8309094 why would any christian not want to know that christ has restored his church to the earth the very church that we read about in the new testament
8309095 foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief corner stone
8309096 then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my names sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another and many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many
8309097 why was i talking to people who were already christian
8309098 i saw a pillar of light exactly over my head above the brightness of the sun which descended gradually until it fell upon me when the light rested upon me i saw two personages whose brightness and glory defy all description standing above me in the air one of them spake unto me calling me by name and said pointing to the other this is my beloved son hear him
8309099 im here to tell you that this is true your neighbor will tell you something else is true you can ask me what is true you can ask your pastor what is true you can ask anyone what is true but i dont want you to get your answer from any of us i want you to get your answer from god through prayer and scripture study that is the only way that i know for myself
8309100 we claim the privilege of worshiping almighty god according to the dictates of our own conscience and allow all men the same privilege let them worship how where or what they may

8309102 and it came to pass that the god of heaven looked upon the people and he wept and enoch bore record of it saying how is it that the heavens weep and shed forth their tears as the rain upon the mountains and enoch said unto the lord how is it that thou canst weep seeing thou art holy and from all eternity to all eternity

8309107 kahneys central premise insofar as there is a premise is that apple has succeeded either despite or because it operates in ways that are contrary to conventional wisdom
8309108 irredeemably evil because theyre secretive and develop closed platforms think about that
8309109 one can argue as i would that apples product secrecy is worth tens of millions of dollars in publicity every year or one can argue that apple spitefully pissed away even more valuable publicity by shutting down think secret youd be wrong but you can reasonably argue that but kahney in the course of seven paragraphs in a single article argues both

8309208 gustav is headed right toward the centre of the gulf of mexico hurricanes taking this route are usually threatening
8309209 between now and the weekend we could see crude prices encounter a fair measure of support as the uncertain path of the storm generates the usual consternation
8309210 we are not convinced that this crisis will be bullish for the energy markets as any punishment meted out by the west will steer well clear of russias energy sector

8309321 youre a 30 year old police officer both taller and heavier than he was
8309322 this was a 12 year old boy from a childrens home who was clearly vulnerable and needed care and looking after
8309323 you still dont seem to accept that you assaulted this boy which concerns me
8309324 he was somebody in a stressful job in a stressful situation who took a step too far and paid a very high price for it
8309325 i will never stay to live in england thats for sure
8309326 you get only a brief glimpse of sunlight before its all cloudy again the winters are mild but in summer the temperatures seldom go higher than 20c and it rains rains rains
8309327 in future i would like to test myself in another top league im thinking of spain at least there will be no reason to complain about the weather they say that manchester is the city of rain its main attraction is considered to be the timetable at the railway station where trains leave for other less rainy cities
8309328 its not only the weather that im not happy about here
8309329 in russia and serbia the peoples way of life is similar
8309330 they all work so hard they only talk to people at lunch break then in the evening they come home and watch the telly so they can get up early for work the next day
8309331 id like to clarify that i did not make these particular remarks
8309332 we need to wait a few more years before we can say definitely that things are getting worse but there does seem to be a growing problem in some areas
8309333 we are seeing parts of the outlying regions being affected rather than just urban areas urban areas might be dealing with the problem more effectively but in the outlying regions it seems to be getting worse places like newport plymouth st davids stockport
8309334 if you look at liverpool sheffield and bristol the levels are low in the outlying areas health services are maybe less available in a city the services are better such as local access to gps
8309335 theres also a certain amount of social stigma attached to being obese it may be that these obese people are not going to see their gp however we need to bear in mind that some pcts are better at recording the data than others
8309336 it is important that people understand both the dangers of obesity and the benefits to their health of losing weight
8309337 even a modest reduction of 5 10 of body weight leads to reduced blood pressure a reduction in the risk of developing diabetes a fall in obesity related cancer deaths and a reduction in total mortality try google earth
8309338 the psystar saga takes another series of turns not only is the
8309339 single use and family pack license for use on apple labeled systems
8309340 general the software including boot rom code documentation and any fonts accompanying this license whether preinstalled on apple labeled hardware on disk in read only memory on any other media or in any other form collectively the oeapple software are licensed not sold to you by apple inc oeapple for use only under the terms of this license and apple reserves all rights not expressly granted to you
8309341 kahneys central premise insofar as there is a premise is that apple has succeeded either despite or because it operates in ways that are contrary to conventional wisdom
8309342 irredeemably evil because theyre secretive and develop closed platforms think about that
8309343 one can argue as i would that apples product secrecy is worth tens of millions of dollars in publicity every year or one can argue that apple spitefully pissed away even more valuable publicity by shutting down think secret youd be wrong but you can reasonably argue that but kahney in the course of seven paragraphs in a single article argues both
8309344 so this is the sort of logic research and insight that passes for a wired cover story today does anyone at wired even read this shit before publishing it
8309345 if i make a product i have the right to refuse to allow you to sell it at your store
8309346 the eula is intended for individuals and while they might strike parts of it down the judge should side with apples right not to allow a 3rd party to manufacture a product containing apples products

8309356 das hat nichts mit politischer r cksichtnahme oder ressentiments zu tun es ist eine rein gesch ftliche entscheidung auf basis von fakten
8309357 das wird sich betr chtlich auf das gesundheitswesen auswirken und dessen belastung lindern da mehr krebsf lle verhindert werden k nnen
8309358 wir verf gen heute ber die n tigen kenntnisse um die last des krebses weltweit zu reduzieren in australien haben sich die berlebensraten bei krebs in den letzten 20 jahren merklich erh ht 58 der m nner und 64 der frauen waren 5 jahre nach ihrer krebsdiagnose noch am leben
8309359 zum vergleich zwischen 1982 und 1986 waren es nur 41 der m nner bzw 53 der frauen die f nf jahre nach ihrer krebsdiagnose noch am leben waren
8309360 70 der todesf lle durch krebs weltweit waren in l ndern mit geringen und mittleren einkommen zu verzeichnen dies widerlegt die h ufige annahme der zufolge krebs ausserhalb der reichen nationen kein grosses problem sei
8309361 die entscheidung jedes einzelnen nicht zu rauchen die sonne intelligent zu geniessen weniger alkohol zu trinken sich ausgewogen zu ern hren regelm ssig sport zu treiben und an impfprogrammen teilzunehmen kann die krebslast deutlich verringern
8309362 auch wenn die nahrungsmittelpreise weiter kr ftig zulegen und der zugrunde liegende preisauftrieb wegen des st rkeren lohnanstiegs anziehen d rfte

8309389 will he continue to work as hard with a new multi year contract
8309390 what drivers dont realize is that ethanol is one third less energy per gallon
8309391 so if i have a gallon of gas sitting here and a gallon of ethanol im going to get more energy out of a gallon of gas than on a gallon of ethanol
8309392 virtually every car on the road runs on e10 just fine with no problems whatsoever
8309393 you can immediately go to 14 billion gallons of ethanol without having to worry about infrastructure concerns like the cars engine or gas pumps or anything like that
8309394 so if you have a non ffv and you pump it into your vehicle youre going to have a very serious large expense in front of you to the tune of thousands of dollars vehicles that dont run on e85 if you do pump it into those vehicles the problem is it will corrode the fuel lines the tank the fuel pump destroy the fuel filter etc
8309395 if you are comparing performance and that kind of stuff e85 is an extremely high performance fuel and thats why the indy racing league runs exclusively on ethanol
8309396 today ethanol is becoming far more of a viable alternative to gasoline as will other technologies like hybrids and plug in hybrids and all of this other stuff that will come its ethanol that is the first foot in the door
8309397 the energy crisis is this country today is such that we cant afford to take any options off the table biofuels and ethanol in particular offer us a very logical and a very easy first step

8309475 the injection of escs into patients because they also have the potential to become cancerous
8309476 with over 100 diseases already being treated with repair stem cells by the worlds finest doctors the need for further esc research merely to add to 10 years of futility is called into question

8309558 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8309559 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain

8309573 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8309574 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8309575 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8309576 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8309577 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8309578 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8309579 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8309580 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8309581 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8309582 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal

8309584 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
8309585 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
8309586 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
8309587 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
8309588 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
8309589 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
8309590 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
8309591 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
8309592 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
8309593 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
8309594 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8309595 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8309596 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8309597 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8309598 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past
8309599 hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historic facts and personages appear so to speak twice he forgot to add the first time as tragedy the second time as farce
8309600 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
8309601 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8309602 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8309603 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
8309604 he will do away with the tax cuts that the congress
8309605 to avoid the obvious problems that will occur when the republican party raises these issues after obama is nominated

8309619 this is a gold medal game are we going to watch free throw shooting or basketball
8309620 dwight howard just had a mental lapse there in a couple ways he lost pau gasol their best player defensively and then he compounded it with the foul this is where you have to have poise
8309621 one of the things lebron has said is that we know that there is one guy on this team who will take big shots and thats kobe bryant thats a big shot coming out of the timeout to sort of stem spains run
8309622 great play by kobe bryant i thought that he was going to take the shot but instead the dribble kick pass thats what i always talk about thats how you get those threes in rhythm
8309623 whos been on every play all three plays kobe bryant he hit the big shot and hes had two assists in this stretch
8309624 in the type of defense that we the 76ers of the late 70s and early 80s played if one person gambled it was kind of like a spider web type of thing the web stretches if one guy goes the other four sort of cheat and leave their men a little bit to help out in case the ball moves and a guy becomes open you just keep rotating around i dont think it going for steals or blocks is selfish at all i think that its good you have to put pressure on the offense because shooters are so good the offense has such an advantage because it can initiate what takes place so as a defender you have got to try to instigate something to throw them off and make them do something they dont want to do the old term pressure will bust the pipe is very true it will make people change what they want to do
8309625 is there anybody in the nba who loves these moments more than kobe bryant hes been called upon to play defense but this could be a gigantic four point play not only that rudy fernandez has just fouled out of the ball game
8309626 you think about it the united states was up two coach k took that timeout how many points has kobe bryant had his hands in remember he had 10 straight points where he either scored or had the assist
8309627 you see why kobe bryants on this team money under pressure
8309628 interesting enough chris paul is the best free throw shooter on the united states team kobekobe said im shooting these free throws if the united states holds on to win this game kobe bryant took over this game when the lead was cut to two thats why hes the mvp of the nba and could be walking out of here with a gold medal to add to his three nba championships

8309647 many officers exercise that discretion in a number of ways
8309648 what we require of our officers when they do that though is that they are open and transparent

8309866 thats not the question on voters minds i think theyre much more interested in what am i going to do to help them in their lives and so in that sense this is going to be a more workmanlike speech
8309867 he has been going to mumbai for regular health check ups on advice from his doctors for quite a long time

8309869 we are ready to spend time in jail the alliance will continue to protest until our demands are met this government has to resign
8309870 if we leave before this government resigns that means we are defeated
8309871 they want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out and do the coup again
8309872 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8309873 to our enormous surprise the free radicals survive hours days even indefinitely

8309887 when we think of neanderthals we need to stop thinking in terms of stupid or less advanced and more in terms of different
8309888 wow there cant be a faster way of doing that
8309889 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8309890 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8309891 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8309892 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8309893 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

8309907 for from him and through him and to him are all things to him be the glory forever amen
8309908 worthy are you our lord and our god to receive glory honor and power for you created all things and because of your will they exisited and were created
8309909 from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat for in the day that you eat from it you will surely die
8309910 so he drove the man out and at the east of the garden of eden he stationed the cherubim and the flaming sword which turned every direction to guard the way to the tree of life
8309911 the lord is not in slow about his promise as some count slowness but is patient toward you not wishing any to parish but for all to come to repentance
8309912 we are to be conformed to the image of his son
8309913 draw near to god and he will draw near to you
8309914 for all have sinned and fall short of gods glory
8309915 for just as man will die and then face the judgment
8309916 there is salvation in no one else there is no other name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must be saved
8309917 i am the way and the truth and the life no man come to the father but throuth me
8309918 and if anyones name was not found written in the book of life he was thrown into the lake of fire
8309919 dai ti prego domani vieni con me altrimenti se mi viene un colpo di sonno e vado a sbattere mi dovrai tenere per sempre sulla coscienza
8309920 so the real challenge of this conference starts as we leave
8309921 i dont think she can get my votes but i can get hers
8309922 when i first moved here from arizona i lived with tommy niemeyer from the accused in a warehouse at 14th and jackson
8309923 barrett martin from skin yard lived there as well and eventually the screaming trees moved in too i ended up hearing most of sweet oblivion being written and practiced before they recorded it
8309924 i will be going to the groundlings school to study comedy
8309925 it is legendary and has been a dream of mine for years id like to apply to the upright citizens brigade as well i am really excited about the move but if you see me around its because i love seattle and will be back here often
8309926 it seems like theres been this big garage rock explosion lately and we really dont sound anything like that
8309927 booking agents dont really seem to know who to stick us with
8309928 my primary focus continues to be retail on vashon because i enjoy the social aspect and love the community here
8309929 if someone likes a certain wine that i know is coming in ill include a bottle and then average out the price of it in the rest of the case
8309930 its difficult finding 12 different rhone blends month to month or putting together a half case of new off dry whites sometimes a customer requests a second bottle of something i gave him three months ago the name eventually comes to me
8309931 in the last day pagliacci pizza started receiving calls from fellow pizzeria owners complaining about a postcard they had received containing disparaging words on it pagliacci did not have anything to do with sending the postcards
8309932 i then noticed that it was on their 25th anniversary cardstock and its obviously some weird joke
8309933 you look at case law involving public figures and limited public figures and this being something said in a political not sure how compelling a claim it is
8309934 mr bader comes and goes and doesnt have any other employees he is very hard to pin down
8309935 ill definitely ask him about it when he gets back in town
8309936 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8309937 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8309938 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8309939 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8309940 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8309941 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8309942 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8309943 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8309944 the difference between a weed and a flower is a polls archive
8309945 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8309946 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8309947 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8309948 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8309949 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8309950 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8309951 access to some of the last available advertising space for the 2008 olympic games
8309952 a great way to foster cultural exchange while showcasing incredible technology
8309953 its a way to underwrite the cost of the devices
8309954 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8309955 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8309956 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8309957 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8309958 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8309959 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8309960 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8309961 who are open to doing something on the production side
8309962 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8309963 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8309964 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8309965 one was deco and one was robinho and we have already seen the impact deco has already made on the premier league
8309966 i think the squad is strong and capable of competing in all competitions without robinho but with him it is an added dimension
8309967 id like to clarify that i did not make these particular remarks
8309968 i spoke about the difficulty i had settling in to life in manchester but that does not reflect how i feel now
8309969 in manchester the main attraction is a timetable at the railway station where trains leave for less rainy cities
8309970 throughout the week they people all work so hard then in the evening they come home and watch the telly so they can get up early for work the next day
8309971 if our brand is at that site we will be supplying the gas
8309972 as the oil companies exit we think there will be more flexibility
8309973 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8309974 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8309975 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8309976 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

8309987 there was a semi guerrilla aspect to the whole thing we got kicked out of a couple fountains including the one right in front of the central library
8309988 i find that his writing for the voice is direct and visceral but this remains completely subservient to the dimensions of space and movement that he includes whats more i find byrons music to be relevant and revelatory employing his art to open our eyes to issues that we should be aware of
