9140029 ik heb 90 procent van de inrichting gedaan dat vindt jan een vrouwending alleen de hertenkop boven de open haard is zijn keus
9140030 hij vindt robin hood heel leuk en daar heb ik dus rekening mee gehouden het hele huis waar we gaan wonen is een beetje avontuurlijk gezellig
9140031 we hebben een zebra badkamer en een zwarte badkamer voor de gasten zelf badderen we tussen ronde romeinse bogen en we hebben kroonluchters die moeten er als we verhuizen het laatst in na de grote loungebanken die we hebben uitgezocht anders gaan de luchters kapot
9140032 jan zit aan de koffie en speelt met zijn mobiel hij laat mij mijn gang gaan en dat is ook zo lief aan hem al toen we een half jaar samen waren zat ik met de bouwtekeningen of ik maar even wilde aangeven waar de stopcontacten moesten komen
9140033 jan en ik zijn dankbaar dat het ons wordt gegund
9140034 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
9140035 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes

9140038 there has been no improvement in the ground situation so far hence the conditions are still not conducive for resuming work today
9140039 at 31 samantha has a long time to go to retirement so having her money invested in equities is not a bad idea as she has time for her fund performance to even out the short term volatility of the market
9140040 but she should look at diversifying her pension fund to include some fixed interest and commercial property funds

9140046 now how you got across that river alive i dont know but your wife just made your bail so now youre really dead for sure
9140047 it runs against the rules set down both for the holding of government data and set down by the external contractor and certainly set down in the contract that we had with the external contractor
9140048 reviewing the terms of that contract and other contracts with pa consulting
9140049 i am shocked by the level of expenditure on consultants and even more shocked by the way the government seems to have become dependent on consultants for the delivery of core public services
9140050 the public will be alarmed that the government is happy to entrust their 20bn id card project to the firm involved in this fiasco
9140051 this will destroy any confidence the public still have in this white elephant and reinforce why it could endanger rather than strengthen our security
9140052 frankly the keystone cops would do a better job running the home office and keeping our data safe than this government and if this government cannot keep the data of thousands of guilty people safe why on earth should we give them the data of millions of innocent people in an id card database
9140053 the data loss by a home office contractor demonstrates that personal information can be a toxic liability if it is not handled properly and reinforces the need for data protection to be taken seriously at all levels
9140054 hey little one no need to run im giving them the personal belongings to you

9140084 kelistrikan jawa bali rata rata mencapai 17 200 mega watt mw perkiraan beban puncak 16 300 mw sehingga masih ada cadangan daya 700 900 mw

9140086 capping harga ekspor lng dengan flat selama 25 tahun itu menurut saya menjadi tanda tanya karena pada intinya seharusnya harga itu bisa menghasilkan devisa sebanyak banyaknya bagi indonesi
9140087 saya menduga ini semata mata ada konspirasi antara receiving terminal di fujdian dengan produsen lng di tangguh
9140088 sebaiknya pemerintahan sekarang atau siapapun yang nantinya memerintah mereview kontrak setiap dua tahun sekali itu kuncinya karena kalau empat tahun itu kelamaan

9140091 he had some clear ideas on how he wanted the products to look he even designed the logo which resembles a crown
9140092 silver surfer is a fox picture and im determined never to work with them ever again because of my experience on i robot
9140093 its like the origin of silver surfer was in that movie and im going this is such a f ing great story why throw it away i think they messed it up
9140094 the resident was covered in petrol and glass but the fuel failed to ignite
9140095 the elderly man escaped with minor cuts to his arm and finger
9140096 the victim was unable to offer any explanation for the attack
9140097 although there are scattered signs that the economy may be close to bottoming out there is little optimism about an actual upturn in key arizona indicators during the second half of this year
9140098 while gas prices have slowly begun to decrease the relatively high price levels may continue to impact retail sales negatively
9140099 were sitting here waiting for about 400 to 500 kids to show up
9140100 we even put up billboards to let them know when school started
9140101 that while the district understands family vacations are important during the school year being away from school is going to have a negative effect on their childrens achievement
9140102 we will have been in school three and a half weeks before the day after labor day
9140103 it cant be that all these people are just moving in at that time and dont know when school starts
9140104 some people who are returning students every year who go on vacation and just dont come back until after labor day
9140105 jaeger said he cant explain the phenomenon which apparently doesnt happen in some other area districts including sunnyside marana and flowing wells
9140106 if i get there when im supposed to i get something else for free
9140107 i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care i just think he doesnt know
9140108 i get satisfaction i pick up my feet im the center of attraction by staying off the streets

9140113 as in other countries the primary caregivers of small children in afghanistan are their mothers however in this country mothers are subject to a number of restrictions in the decision making process regarding child healthcare
9140114 the poor economic and educational status of these women and their overall immaturity caused by a lack of learning opportunities may have resulted in difficulties in preventing illness in their children
9140115 culturally appropriate programmes with multifaceted approaches that provide families and communities with education and child marriage
9140116 current country wide efforts to ensure that all women have access to formal education the elimination of poverty and the improvement of sanitary conditions should be further enforced
9140117 completes a pattern of hyped one sided reportage that goes back a while
9140118 fear that irans nuclear program is intended to make bombs
9140119 each countrys choices and decisions in the field of peaceful uses of nuclear energy should be respected without jeopardizing its policies or international cooperation agreements and arrangements for peaceful uses of nuclear energy and its fuel cycle policies
9140120 many npt state parties particularly those from the non aligned movement nam have already stated their opposition to president bushs proposals to restrict enrichment in their view precluding states from developing enrichment and reprocessing capabilities contradicts an important tenet of the npt that is the deal made by the nuclear weapon states nws to the non nuclear weapon states nnws article iv of the npt states that nnws have the inalienable right to develop research production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes a right intended to provide an incentive for nnws to give up the pursuit of nuclear weapons the bush proposals however introduce another element into the nonproliferation regime by segmenting countries into those that can engage in enrichment and reprocessing and those that cannot since most states with fuel cycle capabilities are from the developed world it is clear that the target group of the proposal is the developing world
9140121 western states want to monopolize nuclear fuel production and are using the trumped up fear of iran as a pretext
9140122 in 1978 iran had the fourth largest nuclear power program in the world and the largest by far among third world nations the shahs plan called for the installation of 20 nuclear power reactors by 1995 to provide some 23 000 megawatts of electricity the shah saw nuclear electricity as the rational means to diversify irans dependence on petroleum and as means to counter the enormous pressure from washington and london to recycle his petrodollars to new york and london banks
9140123 a century of war anglo american oil politics and the new world order
9140124 congress is already investigating allegations of manipulation in the oil market and it seems likely that it is only a matter of time before a similar investigation will be required in the precious metal markets
9140125 the data in the bank participation report is so clear and compelling that it is hard to conclude anything but manipulation
9140126 there is a lot of nervousness especially in energy pits about the efforts underway to propose wrong footed legislation from politicians who want to bring down the price of gasoline
9140127 i dont believe we have a speculative bubble but these moves are going to drive a lot of hot money out of commodities pits between now and the elections
9140128 there is indeed a rational explanation for the decline in the price of gold and silver the dollar has staged one huge rally and fundamentals suggested the dollar should rally
9140129 stand to buy or sell the commodities taking the other side from other people or institutions entering a market
9140130 because investors particularly short term technically oriented funds were selling
9140131 what you have here is the footprints of hedge funds exiting the commodities markets en masse

9140134 how much faster can you render the blue screen of death
9140135 well not sure if its relevant but from what i hear from people at my university research is going on delving deeper into a cpu that uses light instead of electricity as light travels much faster than electrons
9140136 yo considero personalmente que ese problema s lo se resolver a trav s del di logo y la negociaci n
9140137 este pa s tiene que conocer un escenario de paz y democracia que le permita seguir su futuro y al mismo tiempo siempre dentro de ese proceso liberar a todos los presos y presas pol ticos vascos
9140138 all of the theories are based on circumstantial evidence and a lot of supposition
9140139 thats why being another theory i dont think this is jack the ripper but it cant be ruled out
9140140 i dont know that digging up people on a speculative basis would be appropriate
9140141 it is possible we might still find out one day who jack the ripper was it is equally possible that no one will ever know
9140142 were here at solomons house where he has just chosen a royal blue tie for todays make it or break it meeting what do you think of the selection jim
9140143 definitely two snaps down paula i know his names solomon but this is a meeting not a coronation he needed to show he was out for blood so the maroon silk tie was the obvious choice solomon definitely missed the mark on this one
9140144 today at the jones residence we have witnessed a recycling tragedy solomon is apparently not going green and has no intention to do so what impact will that have on the environment steve
9140145 we might as well start dressing in ice packs right now suzy because solomon jones has just single handedly sped up global warming by 10 years arrest him
9140146 i cant believe what our hidden cameras have just uncovered mary solomon jones is apparently driving from one gas station to another with the gas light on looks like hes dare i say it trying to save a dollar
9140147 you mean hes trying to find gas below 3 50 is he a lunatic barry
9140148 apparently so mary im really at a loss for words on this one and you know im never at a loss for words
9140149 barry if solomon continues this crazy quest for gas below 3 50 especially with the gas light on hes gonna tear up his car and wreck his marriage
9140150 youre right mary and not only that studies have shown that people who drive with the gas light on are 10 times more likely to step on bugs he probably kicks puppies too

9140157 biden allies note that despite his long service in washington he is at his core an outsider inside the beltway while that may well be true the optics for obama arent great he cant change the fact that in picking biden he would be going with someone who has spent nearly his entire adult life not only in politics but as a member of the worlds greatest deliberative body

9140165 what did i do i resigned from the paper and gave the money back and this is the treatment its silly its juvenile
9140166 we wish jay well and will miss him not personally of course but in the sense of noticing he is no longer here at least for a few days
9140167 in spinning his story to the chicago tribune mariotti depicted the sun times as the titanic and it was clear the self proclaimed tough guy was knocking over the old women and children to be the first to jump ship
9140168 i think theyre offended that im saying that and that wasnt my original tone
9140169 im very saddened by whats happening ive spent 17 years of my life there nobody can say i didnt care about that paper
9140170 thats what they wanted him to be and its a role he played well
9140171 it invites the question if he was such a terrible guy why did you pay him so much money to stay for so long
9140172 i find the gush of columns on the part of the sun times embarrassing a testament perhaps to just how influential mariotti was
9140173 we do not hate him at least we struggle not to
9140174 we cant honestly say that we are glad we met him
9140175 but we pray that god speeds him to his next assignment and that god blesses nurtures strengthens supports and comforts all those who come in contact with him in the future

9140207 ill just have a little cake with my children and well probably watch some cartoons
9140208 i am letting them enjoy their childhood as much as possible i let them go to the arcade and go to the movies and do things i think that comes naturally i want them to get to do things i didnt get to do
9140209 i get pretty emotional when i see them having a wonderful time
9140210 looking forward to doing a lot of great things i think the best is yet to come in my true humble opinion
9140211 we have assembled a first rate creative team to bring mahalia to life and are thrilled to have an artist of keshia chant s stature in the lead we are confident that this series will break new ground showcasing some extraordinary canadian musical and filmmaking talent and telling a story of tremendous emotional resonance
9140212 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
9140213 all of us at showtime wish david and his family the best during this very private time
9140214 i liked the way alex came back in the second half
9140215 yes he had some bad downs but he also had some good ones
9140216 i think thats where the read told me to go
9140217 coach martz was talking to me about trusting the receivers
9140218 i felt good about letting the ball go and turning it loose

9140220 we give all kinds of esteem and applause to athletes and political figures while missionaries are affecting and changing peoples lives yet they come and go in silence
9140221 weve been to wal mart five times in five days
9140222 we always knew that god wanted us to be missionaries
9140223 i never thought the lord would want me in a place like uganda
9140224 though it was the last place i couldve ever imagined being useful there was such a great need for someone with a technological background
9140225 we took things that would make our house feel more like a home
9140226 we read so many books talked to so many people and thought we knew what to expect
9140227 and still those first few months it was like watching national geographic
9140228 at first you dont see families and people you see african
9140229 you see huts instead of homes it was an adjustment still is
9140230 the first thing they see is the color of our skin
9140231 and of course our child was blond so they all wanted to meet and touch us we got and still get a lot of attention
9140232 i was a wife and a mother taking care of my kids was a majority of what i did
9140233 there are always fears and concerns but you cant let those things consume you life
9140234 all you can do is take all of the necessary precautions
9140235 as soon as the gates open all the children from the village peek around and want to look inside it keeps us safe because there are dangers on the other side
9140236 we give all kinds of esteem and applause to athletes and political figures while missionaries are affecting and changing peoples lives yet they come and go in silence

9140252 if the detectives had revealed to the prosecution that in fact they had paid sandy for her cooperation in the homicide investigation these witnesses would not have been able to lie and assert that sandy had not been paid for her cooperation
9140253 the fact that these witnesses were able to lie unimpeached directly resulted in the defendants conviction
9140254 but another one we see a lot of is aedes albolopictus
9140255 anytime you have these long dry spells and then all of a sudden you get lots of rain youre going to have a humongous mosquito hatch
9140256 the mosquitoes we have in this area lay eggs that can be dormant as long as four years
9140257 theyve really started to pile up and if you put it on the calendar its the rain a week and a half ago
9140258 and with more rain we got last week it will be worse next week
9140259 so within the next week and a half well have five operators out there using five trucks

9140265 there appears to be 169 that are delinquent on their child support payments
9140266 would you like the opportunity to go back to work or would you like to stay with us for awhile
9140267 the cuts they have asked for are not just whittling away at power or fuel budgets
9140268 the order of magnitude is far beyond what we could do by simple economizing
9140269 we have probably seen a 25 to 30 percent drop in applications over the last six months
9140270 i think the national media is killing the augusta market we have so many good things going for us with mcg and fort gordon its giving a false sense that properties are going down and thats not true in the augusta market
9140271 i think the values are very flat and if theyre waiting for the values to go down i dont think theyre going to do it its a great time to buy now rates are still low
9140272 in 2007 i closed averaging 15 units a month for 2 8 million
9140273 for 2008 ive closed 3 2 million a month for 18 loans

9140278 youll get a reluctant glimpse into that dark place in my psyche that just cant get enough of peugeots
9140279 if i truly like all of the crap ive been foisting upon you is there
9140280 if this were a 1973 monte carlo which its not instead of the 1992 volvo wagon that we have i would right now be looking at a dashboard rendered entirely in matte black

9140291 het succes van de wii gaat zeker niet ten koste van ons consumenten kopen onze playstation 3 sneller dan we ze kunnen produceren
9140292 we hebben ons een tijd lang op dezelfde doelgroep als nintendo gericht met de singstar karaoke game maar we hebben het nagelaten die weg verder te volgen
9140293 de wii is een goed gemaakt apparaat dat een nieuwe doelgroep heeft gevonden maar het is een geheel andere ervaring
9140294 playstation games zijn nou eenmaal meer ontworpen voor diegene die veel gamen hoewel het een andere strategie is halen wij er zeker voordeel uit we hebben momenteel namelijk een bottle neck in de productie van playstation 3
9140295 in ieder geval niet zolang ik leef dat gaat zeker een heleboel tijd kosten het traditionele bedrijfsmodel voor de playstation houdt echter rekening met een verlies op de hardware in de beginjaren tot het moment dat de productiekosten omlaag kunnen en het voor ons mogelijk wordt om break even te spelen

9140303 faith is being certain of what we do not see
9140304 now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see
9140305 now faith is the assurance of things hoped for the conviction of things not seen
9140306 if i do not see it cannot weigh it cannot examine it with my rational mind then i cannot use my reason and logic to employ it faith is trust trust can sometimes make sense and sometimes not but these are not matters subject to logic in the strict sense they are matters for reasoned judgment
9140307 indeed but most importantly dont be afraid to admit you may be wrong
9140308 our perception of reality is always subject to change and to the extent our perception of reality does change so too must our belief in the truth of things change

9140313 it feels good to come back after that year and take out south aiken
9140314 when we messed up on offense our defense really gave it to them thats what we hoped for all night
9140315 we didnt do a whole lot on offense the rest of the half
9140316 this is what weve practiced for i knew i was going to get the ball and i wanted it
9140317 im actually a little disappointed that we didnt get it to johnson more
9140318 we want to get it to him 40 times a game
9140319 every time they needed a big play they got it we had to get our defense off the field and couldnt do it
9140320 hes our best defensive back and we feel like weve got a good secondary if we can get them on the field at the same time
9140321 theyre going to have to learn to play both ways
9140322 but we came out and got a good result theres plenty enough we can improve from tonights performance
9140323 were going right down the field and make them sit down
9140324 every single one of them is going to be this tough
9140325 we blocked better tonight and the penalties and turnovers we corrected but the offensive line came to play tonight i think we threw one pass and just ran the ball ren fell has been doing a great job kicking the ball and the guys did a great job covering kicks our special teams did a good job
9140326 fox creek played a hard game their kids played really tough the coaches had them ready we had a lot of trouble there in the first quarter the second half we made some big plays on them overall i was pleased with our teams execution tonight
9140327 well our no 1 goal is to get out alive we knew we were playing silver bluff and al lown and that crew up there are a class act we want our kids to step it up to the next level overall i am extremely pleased i dont think the scoreboard reflects the way we played coach lown did come up to me after the game and said coach yall hit us much harder than we thought you would the intensity was aggressive the kids didnt give up and thats all i wanted out of this night
9140328 and major elam came out of nowhere something lit that guys motor he was all over the place if we hadnt had him pass rushing i dont know what we would have done
9140329 i just had a chip on my shoulder because i didnt get to play last year
9140330 i was ready to get out and win a championship
9140331 after the first few plays i kind of settled down
9140332 we knew hed be wide open and he was wide open
9140333 our coaching staff came up with a game plan and we stuck to it even when we got behind early our kids have bought into the system and they believe and when youre able to pull one out like this you believe in what youre doing even more

9140346 what happened last saturday was not arsenal and we needed to show it could not happen again
9140347 you take in the criticism but the key is that we knew ourselves we were rubbish and that we could have done so much better now we need to show our real selves and we did well against twente
9140348 we knew that we did not put in the needed performance at fulham
9140349 but what happens in between games is not so important the crucial thing is to respond well in the next game which we did
9140350 now we have another big game against newcastle and we need another response to what has happened before

9140359 going into the season we all expected that side of the ball our defense to pay huge dividends for us said the woodlands head coach mark schmid who welcomed back 10 starters on the defensive side of the ball
9140360 they took the ball inside our 10 on their first possession schmid said
9140361 but then they turned it over but we couldnt do anything in the first half either
9140362 at halftime we told the kids we were playing good and our gameplan was going to work schmid said
9140363 we just needed to go out and play a little bit better and we did

9140422 thats what gets me pumped and thats what makes my game better is my fans
9140423 the thing i told the kids at halftime is were very young we graduated a bunch of kids
9140424 i said hey a bunch of you didnt have varsity experience in the first half youre now varsity football players
9140425 and our big deal was we didnt want to come back 10 points at a time we had to come back one good play at a time
9140426 they do what we do offensively and defensively very very similar and theyre very good
9140427 its all a growing experience and well learn for this and well get better

9140429 theres a guy on my job now who is shacking up with his fiancee he doesnt seem to be as enthusiastic as he was when they werent living together i wonder how thats going to turn out
9140430 she and her man have been together 3 years living together for 1 and shes ready to marry
9140431 hello it aint gonna happen and if it does do you really want to look back and feel that you had to trap your man into marriage
9140432 i wouldnt move in with a boyfriend unless i had a ring and a date
9140433 some of my friends think i need to go on and marry him to catch him but nick is already mine they dont understand that though children are not an issue were both in our early 50s and neither of us can have anymore children we only have my high school age children with us his son is almost an adult so there is no having his baby to catch him
9140434 if i feel committed enough to want to live with the woman im with i will buy the ring and ask her to marry me because obviously i feel shes the woman for me to spend the rest of my life with proponents of shacking up will say that if a couple shacks up and doesnt get married its good that they found out they werent meant for each other before they walked down the aisle to that i say if you cant determine that the person youre with isnt someone you can grow with for the rest of your life just from dating them over a period of time without living together youre either not very perceptive or not ready to marry anyone at all my parents have been married for over 26 years i long to have a marriage like that and wont settle for less

9140448 while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9140449 on his 72nd birthday is this really the one heartbeat away he wants to put in the white house
9140450 when you look at a candidate you should ask two questions what have you done and what have you run
9140451 in a way mccain has set a trap on the experience argument
9140452 because if they start picking on her on experience its going to backfire with women
9140453 its just a matter of time that we can address what needs to be addressed in regards to the promotion but im very positive based on the support from the governors office that this will become a reality

9140471 so those forms of selenium will differ in their capacity to change someones antioxidant status and capacity to prevent cancer

9140473 over the last few years particularly in asia we have seen just how deadly the h5n1 virus can be
9140474 so far we have been relatively fortunate and there has been only limited evidence of the virus transmitting from human to human the more we understand about the virus how it interacts with the body the better we will be prepared for any serious mutations that may arise
9140475 if the bird flu virus evolves to favour the receptors in our nose and throat like normal flu the results could be devastating
9140476 we could have a virus which is not only highly infectious but is easily transmissible by coughing and sneezing
9140477 if we can find out which mutations of haemagglutinin prefer which receptors we may be able to identify quickly or even predict which mutations give the virus pandemic potential
9140478 targeting the viruss ability to bind to the receptors which until now has proved far more difficult may provide an alternative more effective way of preventing infection
9140479 we hope that our work will make this process simpler and faster

9140492 several residents are now crammed into disaster shelters here in east portland and the weather continues to make the situation worse

9140494 so they want what weve been doing for the last four or five years they want us to borrow
9140495 im for looking at restructuring our debt and borrowing i think its the way to go i think its a way for us to move forward and come back next year
9140496 we dont want to do it but the budget has to be resolved
9140497 its a legal approach but from a financial and political standpoint its totally irresponsible
9140498 by taking that money out of circulation weve created a huge funding hole and thrown a lot of people out of work
9140499 all theyre really doing is driving themselves deeper into debt without taking care of the structural deficit
9140500 it is like a family taking credit cards and overextending and then getting another one to pay all of the debt off

9140524 but cheech had to come back and work with me he just got divorced for the second time

9140528 we found ourselves in an awkward situation when a country militarily invading and occupying our country then recognizing part of its territories is trying to create a sense of normalcy
9140529 i was looking down and brian the driver said look out he hit the brakes really hard you could see the front of the truck coming at the car

9140537 he is me they can take it down from the rafters and put it on his back
9140538 i am very happy my son will follow in my footsteps
9140539 hopefully he will have a long and productive career in new york i am proud of him and wish him nothing but success
9140540 i thought our defense came out really strong early and it was a good thing they did since our offense needed a little time to get used to the game
9140541 we were just a lot more comfortable in the second half
9140542 with the addition of a marketplace the android ecosystem is becoming even more robust
9140543 i am incredibly energized by the support and amazing content ive seen so far
9140544 we already had a messaging service that can work over text messages so when we started developing a mobile app we wanted to take a huge step up from that
9140545 android is the only platform where every phone will have gps an accelerometer and where the application can run in the background
9140546 what developers want is to code for a few platforms and reach a large audience people have been developing for the iphone because of coolness factor but also because the iphone 3g has huge distribution around the world
9140547 it will come down to how fast android can build market share and create a compelling market
9140548 the report also quotes putin as saying he suspects somebody in the u
9140549 let tyrants fear i have always so behaved myself that under god i have placed my chiefest strength and safeguard
9140550 it was good a nice track and a great crowd
9140551 my start was not too good i concentrated on winning and as i am starting to get a cold i was not able to think about any faster a time
9140552 my coach told me that i should make sure to end the season healthy
9140553 but this was my best race with the best pacemakers the world record is now closer but im not sure i can do it this year maybe next theres still one race to go for the jackpot

9140556 i dont think ive ever walked five batters in a game
9140557 weve done what weve tried to do and get their starters out

9140559 peace co operation and mutual assistance with abkhazia and south ossetia
9140560 the world has already become different and russia will not long be able to occupy sovereign georgian territory
9140561 the regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia should think about the fact that if they become part of russia they will be assimilated and in this way they will disappear
9140562 a step towards further escalation of tensions with russia and the desire to drive the situation into an even worse deadlock
9140563 we hope that common sense will prevail over emotions and that eu leaders will find the strength to reject a one sided assessment of the conflict neither party needs the confrontation towards which some countries are being energetically pushed by the eu
9140564 further sliding to confrontation with russia and attempts to put pressure on us are unacceptable as they can entail irreversible consequences in the military political climate and in stability on the continent
9140565 they were scared to kick me the ball at central
9140566 he wasnt really coming at me like he wanted to tackle me
9140567 i was going to give him a move but once i saw him slow up i just kept running just turned on the burners
9140568 the idea was to raise awareness among families especially because this is the first layer of barrier and to help people to realize they are not alone and be able to face the problem
9140569 the cast i worked with had no cinematic training which i though would be useful to access things that a professional actor wouldnt be capable of

9140598 it was disappointing that on the occasion of this historic nomination that one of the greatest health threats facing america today was not more front and center during this years convention
9140599 this is my fourth democratic convention and it has never been so difficult to put hiv aids on the agenda at a time when the aids epidemic is worse in our nations capital than in many parts of sub saharan africa how can aids not be a featured as a priority by our democratic presidential nominee
9140600 disappointed that there was not a specific call to action by the presidential or vice presidential nominees to end the aids epidemic in america
9140601 obama has been a leader on hiv aids here in illinois and i hope that he will continue to personally address the issue during this presidential campaign his direct involvement and leadership remains critical
9140602 lately weve recognized it is a problem in other countries but while weve been tackling aids overseas weve forgotten about the home front
9140603 its time we demand better results from our domestic response to aids
9140604 that is why senator obama has called for a national aids strategy we have to have a plan of action to tackle aids in america
9140605 a national aids strategy has to focus us on achieving concrete outcomes including bringing the hiv infection rate down and increasing access to care
9140606 a strategy has to better coordinate the work of federal agencies and use resources most effectively and it has got to move us away from basing health policy on conservative social agendas and instead design programs based on what works like comprehensive sex education condom promotion and needle exchange

9140635 governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9140636 her selection is yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics
9140637 while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward governor palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9140638 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate

9140686 we were serving about 50 a week now its over 100
9140687 if you stand out here at 5 p m on a weeknight youll see why the work is needed
9140688 these days there is a lot more traffic on the road than it was designed to handle
9140689 thats how a lot of roads in this area started out
9140690 back then it was all right just to follow the ridgeline and when you were going three miles an hour but when youre going 30 miles an hour its not so safe
9140691 weve both been very vocal about being pro life we understand that every innocent life has wonderful potential
9140692 healthy debate is so important and its so valuable in our schools i am a proponent of teaching both
9140693 i say this too as the daughter of a science teacher dont be afraid of information and let kids debate both sides

9140705 it will be very special for me and im sure that im going to enjoy the experience
9140706 i hope to get a good reception from the fans because atletico gave me a lot although i also gave a lot to atletico
9140707 i understand that when the game starts they will see me as a rival but ill never forget the years i spent there for me it will be an amazing feeling to run out onto the vicente calderon pitch again and meet up with old team mates and friends
9140708 its a very difficult group in which every game will be like a final
9140709 marseille already made life very hard for us last season beating us at anfield and leaving us no option but to win at their ground to guarantee our qualification from the group
9140710 psv eindhoven are a tough rival and atletico will want to give the best possible image of themselves
9140711 without doubt my wish is that liverpool and atletico in this order get through to the last 16
9140712 i know what has been said about me about being anti english but i dont know why
9140713 when i spoke about the debts of certain clubs everybody said it was directed at the english clubs but we have many problems in clubs across europe many clubs that have run up massive debts
9140714 clubs like steaua bucharest and cska moscow have already been punished because they dont have respect because they dont have the money but they buy players
9140715 you cant have that and in germany and france it is already forbidden but in england it is still allowed
9140716 racing and bolton have reached an agreement for the loan of ebi smolarek to the british team until june 30 2009

9140732 in his discussion with me he stepped down because his situation with georgia was going to be dragging on for quite a while
9140733 obviously the situation that happened to francois sainfort and julie jacko has not been a positive one for us
9140734 we have cooperated with the georgia attorney generals office and we were led to understand that they were going to be deciding what path to go down by the end of august or early september
9140735 the last thing that i heard through the us office of general counsel was that the attorney generals office in georgia was a long way away from determining what they are going to do
9140736 what im hopeful for is that the georgia attorney general will choose not to file charges and that they can continue here in their faculty leadership roles
9140737 we have certain issues with expenses that were charged to both institutions that we are looking at which are related to but not the same as issues that are of apparent concern to georgia attorney generals office
9140738 we have only limited ability to obtain documents until they are done with their investigation
9140739 obviously the situation that happened to francois sainfort and julie jacko has not been a positive one for us
9140740 we will try to piece this together in regard to whether something serious has indeed happened here in regard to so called double dipping
9140741 basically there are a bunch of people that are coming from twitter over to blip fm
9140742 weve allowed users to integrate their blip account with twitter friendfeed pownce jaiku and tumblr accounts in other words when you blip on blip fm it will also appear as a tweet on twitter
9140743 my favorite description is that if twitter and last fm had a love child it would be blip fm its funny how things come out in web 2 0 parlance

9140747 in discussions with the company to determine a new date
9140748 but it is too early to estimate the impact of the delay on the calendar for 2009 deliveries
9140749 about 30 people were rescued but the current was so strong that there is little possibility of survival of the rest
9140750 four of our soldiers were killed in the fighting ten more wounded and operations are ongoing in the area
9140751 it sounds like someones trying to avoid paying the cost of disposing material the proper way
9140752 this is normally a great weekend for people who want to have a last hurrah
9140753 there is no doubt in my mind that the first incident was deliberately set
9140754 im in awe that thats happening down there i feel horrible for them
9140755 were lucky it wasnt us because with stuff like that it could very easily have been its just a roll of the dice
9140756 there has been no improvement in the ground situation so far hence the conditions are still not conducive for resuming work today
9140757 im getting out of here i cant take another hurricane
9140758 we dont want folks worrying about their property it is time for people to be worried about their personal safety
9140759 my thing is my fright is if we have somebody in these houses and theyre not able to get out theyre going to perish
9140760 yeah we have to do the little things to win but we have guys to do the little things
9140761 guys run the bases well and we can hit and run and we can bunt and we can do all those things to win games but the key is pitching daisuke was outstanding and thursday jon lester was outstanding if we get pitching performances like that were going to win games
9140762 this is a little bit of a rapid ascent but i think we all feel our development people especially that he can handle whatever comes at him its an exciting day for the organization
9140763 we walked one guy then we hit another guy then the gates open
9140764 javy threw the ball better than will show up in the box tomorrow
9140765 i think he threw the ball good he was in trouble early in the game after that he settled down and we didnt make a couple of plays for him
9140766 daisuke threw the ball really well and it was well needed when youre facing a guy like vazquez
9140767 matsuzaka gets his pitch count up and its hard to keep him in extended innings but he was more efficient today even better than he was in toronto he had good stuff
9140768 today he ran into contact earlier in the count and you cant always force that because it depends on the hitters but that helped him he was strong he had a good fastball and it complemented his slider and cutter and mixed in just a couple of changeups
9140769 he threw more strikes today hes always throwing high counts but today he threw strikes and we were flailing for it he threw the ball good youve got to give him some credit
9140770 we got players and guys who know what to do and so we go from there
9140771 they chose this moment to grandstand and to utilize their power to go ahead and make an arrest on something that they knew two months ago
9140772 when they knew a lot of people were going to be here a lot of cameras were going to be here and they decide to put on a little show on minor economic crimes
9140773 theyre more interested in making her look bad instead of finding caylee
9140774 who is the bigger liar cindy anthony or killer casey may god have mercy on you

9140777 americans like risk takers but they also want to know that in times of crisis youre going to be calm

9140779 thats the balance that john mccains going to have to show the public
9140780 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction
9140781 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
9140782 several residents are now crammed into disaster shelters here in east portland and the weather continues to make the situation worse
9140783 these rains will likely produce life threatening flash floods and mudslides
9140784 the coalition partners have the impression that the situation is deteriorating and we are thinking of telling the prime minister to decide on the future of the government
9140785 they want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out and do the coup again
9140786 she is shooting now we are not giving out any specifics on her character
9140787 a few months before cameron welsh the series producer called me and went through the storyline to make sure i was comfortable with it
9140788 this has been the biggest challenge for me as an actor even though martha has been through a lot
9140789 i researched the storyline with the help of a young girl called nikki dwyer who had breast cancer and our medical advisor wendy odonnell guided me through the medical and emotional side
9140790 i never thought i could feel this way im totally in love hes so young and fit ive had botox injections because i feel so old
9140791 im doing this because i want people to see the me as me the fun me
9140792 people only ever see me playing characters so they get this one sided view of what im like
9140793 to tell you the truth we started writing down actors we wanted to work with
9140794 i cant imagine them not being together making a movie i cant think of one without the other
9140795 ive talked to them many times about doing something bigger something smaller something more commercial its very hard to find anything that interests them
9140796 and all theyre left with are the parts of the city that nobody else wants
9140797 it was truly and authentically multicultural and it was alive
9140798 the main thing is we want to be where out families are where our community is
9140799 twenty thirty years ago you could come to scarborough and see 30 or 40 wexford restaurants
9140800 my parents they catered to all the smiths the joneses the johnsons
9140801 those people are a fraction of the business now you have to adapt
9140802 in the early 90s a lot of stores around here were closing infrastructure got creaky
9140803 and then the recession hit so it was really bottoming out
9140804 youd see a halal meat store open in one of the vacant storefronts or a falafel stand
9140805 things were starting to change but you couldnt really see it
9140806 when i came back six years later i just thought this is really interesting
9140807 it wasnt a mono ethnic community at all it was so mixed somalis mixing with lebanese mixing with older communities like italians mixing with the old scots that were still around there was this gap this transition and it opened the door for new groups to settle in it was kind of incredible
9140808 thirty years ago no one in the suburbs in their right mind would set foot in kensington market now every yuppie in toronto is there so things change
9140809 this is not the monoculture whatever it was designed to be
9140810 i dont know it looks like it could be funny
9140811 okay but buy a ticket for something else and sneak in please
9140812 okay their gonna leave now the scene scene drags on and on to a point that you want to kill yourself and the crowd is still there they didnt laugh and they are still here i was surprised
9140813 this is the first time you actually made me laugh
9140814 if you like seeing youre heroes like indiana jones getting made fun of then this movie is for you
9140815 now for the first time the scrolls will be a computer click away
9140816 this will ensure that the scrolls are preserved for another 2 000 years

9140818 this will ensure that the scrolls are preserved for another 2 000 years
9140819 my personal feeling is that my faith is something i practice in the way i lead my life and when i go to synagogue
9140820 i dont need the democratic party or the republican party or the u s senate to help me do that
9140821 my personal feeling is that my faith is something i practice in the way i lead my life and when i go to synagogue

9140919 ayun napahalinday ako maiyak feeling ko nawawala ako alam mo yung feeling na mababait naman lahat pero nung time na yun parang usually meron kang malaking step na gagawin sa buhay mo pray ka lang kay god di ba hindi ko na naisip yun nung sinabing abs ka na sabi ko okay okay
9140920 tapos pag apak ko mismo dito sa studio ecomoda manila biglang naisip ko theres no turning back
9140921 siyempre hindi pa rin hindi mo naman maipagpapalit yung eight years sa three days di ba medyo mahirap yun pero ganon talaga sana talaga tuloy tuloy na ang career ko dito sa abs sana mga 20 years dito lang ako
9140922 siyempre wala namang gustong umano di ba kumbaga na parang nabuild mo na yung buong buhay mo sa isang lugar tapos biglang one day para kang nangibang bansa eh para akong ofw pero of course masasanay ka naman talaga
9140923 kahit anong sabihin ko choice ko to and kailangan kong panindigan and masaya ako talaga and excited ako sa kung ano mang pwedeng mangyari sa akin dito pero siyempre kung ano mang pamilya ang meron ako dun hindi ko makakalimutan yun kasi walong taon din yun di ba pero masaya ako
9140924 hindi lang ako nakapagpaalam sa mga higher levelings pag nakita ko na lang sila kasi hindi naman ako yung tipong tinetext sila or pinupuntahan sila sa taas syempre ayoko naman na hey aalis na ako so pag nagkita na lang sasabihin ko maam thank you po
9140925 ay im sure naiintindihan nila ako kasi kailangan ko tong gawin eh personal growth ko na din wala eh wala akong pwedeng ibang puntahan
9140926 of course kaya nga kapamilya di ba so yun ang dapat ko gawin magbuo ng bagong pamilya pero siyempre naman hindi ko makakalimutan yung mga kaibigan ko sa kabila
9140927 oo naman siyempre ako pa napaka friendly lahat kaibigan ko so parang hindi naman ako yung tipong natatakot o kung ano man
9140928 its a night time shoppers nightmare you buy groceries go to your car and someone tries to rob you at gunpoint
9140929 it appears to be an armed robbery that went badly for the suspect because he picked an armed customer
9140930 there has been no improvement in the ground situation so far hence the conditions are still not conducive for resuming work today
9140931 there has been no improvement in the ground situation so far hence the conditions are still not conducive for resuming work today
9140932 acted in a ridiculous fashion with a tin of paint while drunk
9140933 the new lighting will make this pivotal feature of egremont even more prominent and will help to create an enticing atmosphere at night
9140934 it is just another step towards realising the full potential of this superb asset egremont castle has an important role to play in the renaissance of the town and plans are progressing for this historic monument to be a thriving outdoor performance venue
9140935 this project will make the castle literally shine as the jewel in the crown of egremonts lovely market place which is close once again to looking at its best
9140936 it has taken a lot of work to get to this stage but i am sure the castle will once again become a beacon and attract many people into the town
9140937 it is a dream long realised and an aspiration of the friends group to see our castle lit at night
9140938 we would ask any witnesses or anyone who saw anything to contact police
9140939 i would like to send my personal and heartfelt thanks to each and every one of the 3 734 carlisle women who took part
9140940 i have been told that thanks to their genuine enthusiasm and emotion the atmosphere at bitts park on sunday july 13 was once again truly inspiring
9140941 the brilliant turnout in carlisle has helped make the 2008 series the second largest in the 15 year history of race for life over 700 000 women came together at events across the uk all raising money for research into all forms of cancer while remembering loved ones lost to the disease or celebrating those whove survived
9140942 so far those taking part in the carlisle event have returned an amazing 127 287 in sponsorship
9140943 we are paying for the basic training but cant afford to keep up other costs she has always tried hard at this and been really patient several people have said she has the potential of being a world champion
9140944 she has always tried her best when i think about her achievements i get very emotional i am very proud of what she has done
9140945 i am really excited to go to france it just depends if we can get there i am doing top competitions and have the chance to go all over the world the best thing about competing is the butterflies before the competition i love it
9140946 i was absolutely shocked at first i couldnt believe it i thought demi must have entered me into a school competition not for a district award it was overwhelming but i was incredibly pleased
9140947 the garden is amazing because it has a bit of everything it provides all round interest and is beautifully kept
9140948 its really fantastic very well laid out especially considering the wet august weve had
9140949 ill go out every day to remove a few dead heads but i get totally engrossed and end up gardening for hours
9140950 im naturally drawn there i get so much pleasure that other people enjoy the garden as much as myself
9140951 letting nature take care of most things theres no need to fuss apart from with the weeding
9140952 i hope it doesnt happen it is very bad news for us if alan goes
9140953 i would hope that all of the bodies in west cumbria that have an opportunity to support our athletes would get behind him we need to start looking for a place for alan to train for 2012
9140954 it is just an example of what happens to us here with our lack of facilities
9140955 if there are facilities they should be made available to him we need to keep people like alan in west cumbria
9140956 we have a main hall which would be worth a look to see if it was suitable and available
9140957 we dont get that many people who go to the olympics from copeland and when you do get them it would be nice to keep them
9140958 it is a shame if he had to move out
9140959 if you dont shape up whack youll wind up selling ribbons at kresges
9140960 too many students are short credits and lose interest and hope
9140961 theres a lot more leniency and a lot less work in credit recovery
9140962 kids know that if they fail they can do the class again in six weeks
9140963 as long as you show up youre not gonna fail
9140964 a credit for johnny is not a credit for janey
9140965 the integrity of the credit is in trouble across the province
9140966 at the end of the semester i have kids who say what have i missed what do i need to do to pass
9140967 kids are late to class more often than not but you cant do anything about it and they know it ive tried giving them a quiz at the beginning of the class but then parents say you have to give them a chance to make it up you cant deduct marks you can ask them to stay for a detention but they dont come im always asking teachers what do you do but theres nothing
9140968 they were ordered to immediately hire a qualified consultant and develop plans for securing the site controlling dust and monitoring air quality
9140969 the ministry required the responsible company sunrise and the property owner to take immediate action they didnt do that
9140970 the city never should have left it to those guys to clean it up anyway
9140971 they want someone to step up to the plate and make orders
9140972 it seems like no ones really ever had a plan
9140973 governments should have learned from the mistakes that led to the tragedy in walkerton
9140974 i am completely shocked that prime minister stephen harper has opted to make the same mistakes nationally that led to our disaster food security should never be placed on the chopping block in the name of cost cutting
9140975 toronto is a town that is big into special events
9140976 so when someone spends money to have a really nice menu and really nice d cor and they want the food to taste good i think its just the next logical step
9140977 if i send the wrong people once clients wont have us back again you dont get a second chance
9140978 sometimes it might be 5 or 10 more an hour if clients want to select models or have them dress more risqu but its never double just because our staff is good looking doesnt mean were going to take the client to the bank
9140979 any wife wouldnt be too thrilled about having model types around but you know its a business
9140980 i love to go out and dance and have fun but if i get my fix once a month or every couple of months its great am i a party animal no that was when i was 19 or 20
9140981 even though it sounds frivolous i take my business seriously
9140982 i know this is my livelihood i have to pay my mortgage i have two kids
9140983 what hes done doesnt give out a great message to the supporters if im honest
9140984 the boys are working twice as hard for each other if it was me i would do it differently
9140985 i would work hard for the club up until i actually left id still be playing until i was leaving
9140986 even if i didnt want to be somewhere i would still give 100 per cent because thats the way i w
9140987 gotta pump for da bitch machete for da snitch o my god im caked but cant count it lyke dey stitches
9140988 what we mostly have particularly in the peel region is emerging gangs disorganized crime fluid leadership
9140989 this younger person becomes prime fodder for older generations who are trying to manipulate
9140990 its the age of the people that concerns me they seem so quick to resort to violence to settle minor differences
9140991 i think thats pretty sad a 15 or 16 year old is just starting to live their life they might have turned into something great
9140992 tottenham offered 16m and thats not enough so thats the end of it
9140993 they spurs had several weeks of time to buy him and they did not offer 22m like everybody has been writing but just 16m
9140994 anyone who says i care about the environment would not be consuming jet lagged water from fiji
9140995 fiji water certainly is the must have water of celebrities
9140996 i dont know whether brad pitt and angelina jolie are going to worry about it
9140997 we do work very hard to make a presence at great events like the toronto film festival
9140998 we have people who have vans and deliver product to every place where tv shows are being shot and movies are being made and people will take a break and drink some water and walk back in front of the camera with a water in their hands
9140999 would we rather see the film festival pitch the virtue of toronto tap water to the film festival and its participants yes absolutely
9141000 we can recycle those bottles but it would be far more ideal were it the case we didnt have to
9141001 i think theres a subworld in the drifter department of life that many of us dont know about
9141002 there doesnt appear to be a great underlying motive there seems to be a very minor dispute of some nature certainly unwarranted
9141003 the cops do patrol it but you dont see them very much down here
9141004 this area is pretty well known for drug users people shooting needles smoking crack drinking
9141005 what are they going to have lent and guinness nights
9141006 i thought it was going to be a religious bookstore now its a bar with beer and all these people
9141007 i dont know if its a joke sin on one side of the street redemption on the
9141008 it the dog patrol has been very effective at those beaches where the source of e coli is solely the waterfowl canada geese and ducks
9141009 we have been able to enhance water quality with this program
9141010 the number of geese here now is about half of what they were when i started over a year ago
9141011 were trying to move them from active space for people away from the water to other areas such as storm water ponds
9141012 you have to train them and i knew nothing about working dogs
9141013 we attempted to work through weekends but some unforeseen things happened and it pushed the date to where we couldnt occupy the building in time
9141014 weve focused really strongly on what you might call a subset of media art which relates to the culture and legacy of film
9141015 it began as this weird wild overwhelming phenomenon at the end of the industrial revolution
9141016 and i think the visual artists were featuring this year really capture that spirit
9141017 our first priority is to ensure that future projections speaks to the diversity of art going experiences in toronto so we work with what i call the leading public institutions in the city around art and culture plus what we consider to be the more intelligent private galleries
9141018 with deconstruction instead of traditional demolition nearly 75 percent of the buildings materials will be diverted from the landfill
9141019 h amp c issued checks to 27 different parties that were then fraudulently endorsed by mr wixon in the name of those parties signed over to him and deposited in his account
9141020 mr wixon is looking forward to putting this matter behind him as quickly as possible
9141021 as the price of recycled materials has gone up so has the rate of theft
9141022 i am hopeful that this bill which is so important to improving recycling programs will be signed by the governor
9141023 the most impacted victims will continue to be the environmental justice neighborhoods low income and poverty stricken communities in west long beach and the bordering community of wilmington in the city of los angeles
9141024 they will see no benefits from the revenue raised but bear all the burden of the project
9141025 this is not financially going to make sense this is not going to environmentally make sense
9141026 we could still do all that drilling but the risk and cost would be on the government all this does is flip it onto the contractor
9141027 theres specific language in the bill that any oil extracted must maintain the same environmental footprint that exists now
9141028 the day those tests came in we realized we had a serial killer on our hands who has been active for 23 years
9141029 the governor wanted budget reform to limit spending he gets it the governor wanted a sales tax increase he gets it the governor wanted deeper cuts he gets it
9141030 the only demand we did not give the governor is the tax break the tax cut after the temporary tax expires
9141031 in these difficult times for the airline industry and for hard working angelenos at the airport we must come together to find a solution that meets the needs of workers and the airline industry
9141032 i am urging the workers and contractors with the support of the airlines to come up with a fair agreement that ensures quality services and keeps passengers moving safely and efficiently at the international gateway to southern california
9141033 it brings hope for people who havent had any for three or four hundred years but were just a segment of america so whats happened to us has begun happening for everybody else and that is why he is seen as a person not necessarily as an african american but as a person who is really concerned about whats happening to all americans
9141034 it was one of the most encouraging enlightening insightful and positive speeches that ive heard in my
9141035 it was certainly a watershed moment in the african american community i think it is the realization truly of dr martin luther king jr s vision
9141036 you have to really give him his props on that for someone to be speaking in the right terms about whats really happening in the world today
9141037 last night was very historical it gives a lot of hope to people who may not have hope that a black man can make it and be in a position to be president theres a lot of little kids looking at that kids with no hope
9141038 she said it was a good speech that she was able to understand and that it is our responsibility
9141039 its not what is he going to do on a moral level its what am i going to do
9141040 like carrying some extra food in my car in case somebody is hungry what gets to me most about obama is that even if he wasnt african american i would vote for him
9141041 and that was a serious problem in the black community
9141042 he will improve race relations because it will take a coalition to elect him
9141043 as for the old guard of black politicians i dont see where jesse jackson and them would have any trouble with him they may feel a little jealous but theyve got to be ecstatic about it as well
9141044 its a challenge and its a miracle just to stay open
9141045 its a month to month situation and the way the financial institutions are lending money to small businesses today it doesnt look like ill get any help if we keep on the course were on
9141046 we just hope that obama is being guided by god and not capitalism
9141047 and we hope that hes very much concerned with prioritizing knowledge increasing teacher pay making sure that the infrastructures in our educational systems are up to par to meet the needs of the 21st century
9141048 in africa we say that knowledge is king so we need to prioritize in america god and knowledge
9141049 i think our country is ready for some substantial change not just lip service
9141050 its the big secret everybody knows and the taxpayers of l a county are paying for
9141051 it looks real good that they get all these schools built but no one knows the real cost
9141052 in many cases the expertise is more expensive than we can hire as an employee
9141053 we need to look at it to reduce the number of consultants
9141054 its about finding the balance and making sure were in compliance
9141055 is actually forced to pay far more for contractors to fill many positions
9141056 as you know there is a budget crisis where some of our valuable staff members are losing their jobs
9141057 the board has some very tough decisions in the near future including pay cuts and furloughs it would not be responsible for the district to prompt pay raises for the very top levels of management in this environment
9141058 we want the best that we can get because we want to get it right
9141059 hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america
9141060 exactly who i need to fight the same old washington politics of me first and country second
9141061 is one of the most significant and telling decisions a presidential candidate can make why when the country is fighting two wars facing an uncertain economy and an energy crisis did senator mccain make the choice that he did
9141062 the two words being heard the most around here this morning are dan quayle
9141063 the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience
9141064 her selection is yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics
9141065 while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward governor palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9141066 she seems like a compelling person obviously a terrific story personal story and im sure that she will help make the case for the republicans unfortunately the case is more of the same
9141067 is one more indicator of this country moving forward the fact that youve got a woman
9141068 vice presidential nominee of one of the major parties i think is one more hit against that glass ceiling
9141069 i think you know campaigns start getting these hair triggers and the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments
9141070 he also wished her good luck but not too much luck
9141071 we look ahead to a better day as we also prepare ourselves for another threat
9141072 i think god is reminding us that on the eve of katrina god can bring nature back
9141073 the kids can come to see me in peoria or rome because its a traveling exhibit
9141074 instead of having moms ashes sprinkled in the river shell just be traveling
9141075 its been like a tidal wave of increased visitorship our saturdays have been incredible i feel very good that weve been able to bring it to baltimore
9141076 if you want to know how you are put together
9141077 shes not from these parts and shes not from washington
9141078 she stands up for whats right and she doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down
9141079 i think shes a mile wide and about an inch deep
9141080 but she has the alaskan touch shes a hockey mom she hunts she fishes her husband is a mans man her son joined the army these are powerful images that resonate with a lot of people
9141081 from the moment she began making her mark in politics she was criticized for being too young too inexperienced and too naive
9141082 yet time after time over the years underestimating sarah always proved to be a big mistake
9141083 speaking her own mind and then worrying about whether its popular afterward
9141084 so please then tell me what section i should post im not selling or breeding im offering an opportunity for someone who cant afford their own but has a passion for the enjoyment and ive gotten positive feedback
9141085 farm and garden thats where the majority of the horse listings are
9141086 its disgusting absolutely disgusting after all the promises weve had that this will not happen theyve gone and done it anyway
9141087 they are taking all of the morrisons work to seaham and that only leaves the tesco stuff that we are going to do in maryport
9141088 theyve got two factories in the north east now and that side is going to take over everything ive worked there for eight years and this is a massive blow for me my colleagues and maryport as a whole
9141089 with the economy the way it is there couldnt be a worse time to be put out of work
9141090 im 55 so its going to be very hard to find another job around here
9141091 i wont be saying goodbye to him he is hurting the people i represent
9141092 we welcomed this company when it came but this is terrible news particularly in the current economic climate
9141093 where your treasure is there your heart will be also
9141094 palin michael palin why hes british he cant be mccains vice presidential pick
9141095 he was definitely outplaying me for the first two sets i felt like a little kid out here playing against him
9141096 and then the clock struck 12 and i started playing well as a 26 year old
9141097 i was disappointed in the second set i think i should have finished it
9141098 i wouldnt have won the match already but it would have been a big step
9141099 tonight was probably one of those ones i won on effort
9141100 you guys kept me in there when i was losing my head
9141101 if this crowd comes with me the whole way who knows
9141102 as long as im doing the splits that means im healthy
9141103 when im not doing the splits you know theres something wrong
9141104 i wish i didnt have any drama in my matches i wish i would win nice and in a simple way
9141105 who likes drama do you know anybody that likes to get involved into tight matches
9141106 were choosing the next president of the united states thats the attraction thats why people are involved always
9141107 were committed to this its a real big part of our democracy
9141108 its real busy were going from one meeting to the next like im sure everyone is
9141109 i dont know the degree to which ron paul people will actively campaign for the mccain palin ticket
9141110 my own personal opinion is that there are a lot of very good people in the ron paul campaign and had proclaimed their support for ron paul
9141111 i dont think the party gains anything by trying to drive those people from the party
9141112 we havent had any problems at all its real remarkable
9141113 the ron paul people were pretty upset for a while they were sad they lost
9141114 i spent this morning with a former ron paul delegate fixing gop candidate dino rossi signs that had been vandalized
9141115 as we talked about the rally congressman paul is planning in minneapolis we realized the need for the republican tent to be a big one and that we both look forward to working together to elect our nominee
9141116 my husband and i are still newlyweds this first year has been a cross country commuter marriage our frequent flyer miles are dwindling airfares are climbing so we stand to see even less of each other next year
9141117 the increasing challenges of running a newsroom in todays economic climate demand a leader who can give 110 percent to the job i can no longer do that olympia will continue to be our primary home but the time is appropriate for me to seek fresh challenges that will give me more flexibility
9141118 while we sort out what the newsroom structure will be
9141119 i know from personal experience how tough it is to be the editor of a capital city newspaper
9141120 and i can tell you that vickie has not only persevered but excelled through blinding storms and floods through political cliffhangers riots local tragedies and triumphs vickie has upheld the highest ideals of journalism
9141121 in my 36 years in the olympians newsroom there has never been an editor who has been a greater champion of the first amendment than vickie she pushed reporters and editors to pry open the doors of government using this states open records and open meeting laws and when the laws failed us she went to the state capitol to push new legislation
9141122 both of those laws are the direct result of vickies push to make government open and transparent
9141123 we won awards for watchdog reporting and editorials that have shaped the community agenda we dedicated staff resources to topics of most interest to our readers state government education the environment and outdoors
9141124 now thanks to our online team theolympian com typically receives between 3 and 4 million page views a month
9141125 vickie is a terrific editor who has been a great partner
9141126 this is a big loss for the olympian and for the community that she has served so well i hate to see her leave but i understand the tug of family needs
9141127 while it is painful to part from colleagues who have been like family to me for the past 10 years i have confidence our newsroom will continue to make me proud
9141128 i think there may be a misunderstanding that if you come down to hempfest for two days its ok to be smoking marijuana and thats not the case
9141129 theyre expecting it to be bad so they find bad
9141130 im a medical patient myself but my advocacy doesnt stop there
9141131 cited and released 26 individuals and referred 29 misdemeanor drug charges to the thurston county prosecutors office
9141132 inequities in health avoidable health inequities arise because of the circumstances in which people grow live work and age and the systems put in place to deal with illness
9141133 the conditions in which people live and die are in turn shaped by political social and economic forces
9141134 to marshal the evidence on what can be done to promote health equity and to foster a global movement to achieve it
9141135 reducing health inequities is for the commission on social determinants of health an ethical imperative social injustice is killing people on a grand scale
9141136 we see quite a few states where the number of schools selling junk food in vending machines is very low
9141137 in many places schools are substituting healthier choices and continuing to bring in revenue
9141138 it shows these changes are possible to make all states face the same economic challenges that lead schools to make money by selling junk food this dramatic progress made in states with strong leadership shows the other schools it can be done
9141139 the capitol group plan envisioned uninterrupted views from the temple of justice to the waterfront and from the waterfront to the capitol group of buildings
9141140 wilder and white wanted the dome of the legislative building to be visible everywhere in the city
9141141 and just said to my husband oh my god were going to owe 60 000 to the hospital
9141142 ive never seen a hospital bill that i thought followed all the regulations correctly not once
9141143 no evidence of overcharges in her bill but would be willing to correct any mistakes
9141144 theres no explanation for some of them except purposeful balance billing or overcharging
9141145 the situation is bad mind you not only in czechoslovakia everywhere but we are ready a man can only die once sooner or later
9141146 the wreath was delivered to my sister on wednesday evening
9141147 i am neither geek nor nerd i am not a hacker a phreaker a programmer or any variety of technoid dweeb
9141148 without the internet my life is unimaginable it gives me feelings of being a dweller of the stone age if all of a sudden i were to quit use of the internet but like radio television or telephone or cars and microwave ovens the internet is not going to go away so i think of making best of it rather than thinking about living without it
9141149 a lot of thrill and interactivity is attached with the world online so it really is painful to perceive life without the internet
9141150 when i am disconnected i attend to those assignments that otherwise keep piling up in the in tray waiting for my attention and i keep jotting down things and thoughts what i would do when online
9141151 i have always been going to my village to refresh my urban attitudes but going has become greatly difficult since i have put my work and life on the internet and it is no only me no it professional can afford to live without continuous connectivity one of the reasons is that others assume it people as on call every time
9141152 me and every one in my circle presence on the internet seems to be defining social circles groans and grumbles when ever there is a disruption in connectivity and there are so many

9141172 its going to really boost the ticket and the energy of the base wherever it was lacking because it is a first for the republicans and a good pick

9141185 there has been no improvement in the ground situation so far hence the conditions are still not conducive for resuming work today

9141209 there was glamour style quality luxury and fun in those days you can make a comparison to today when things arent going quite so well at present rather than retreating into our shells perhaps we should learn to enjoy ourselves a bit more if the economys slowing down perhaps theres time to relax and have a bit more fun

9141236 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 per cent of the time
9141237 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
9141238 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
9141239 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
9141240 for over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else in washington they call this the ownership society but what it really means is youre on your own
9141241 our government should work for us not against us it should help us not hurt us it should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence but for every american whos willing to work
9141242 thats the promise of america the idea that we are responsible for ourselves but that we also rise or fall as one nation the fundamental belief that i am my brothers keeper i am my sisters keeper

9141246 he was known chiefly as a clear thinker and a great orator with a passion for justice and a determination to heal the deep divisions of our land he insisted on reaching past partisan and regional divides to exalt our common humanity in 2008 once again we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning and once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition

9141255 what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
9141256 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know why else would he define middle class as someone making under five million dollars a year
9141257 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
9141258 for over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else
9141259 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
9141260 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
9141261 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
9141262 thats the promise of america the idea that we are responsible for ourselves but that we also rise or fall as one nation the fundamental belief that i am my brothers keeper i am my sisters keeper
9141263 individual responsibility and mutual responsibility thats the essence of americas promise

9141269 i didnt think that they would go ahead because their own charter guarantees no censorship
9141270 this is the first time they officially blocked my website

9141287 almost all of the revenue from search advertising comes from transactional searches

9141291 college students can slip into a financial landslide if they dont have the right money management tools and knowledge at their disposal
9141292 students who start college with multiple credit cards are under more stress have difficulty keeping up with expenses and are more likely to believe they may not graduate due to debt
9141293 fortunately there is a wealth of options for students to learn how to manage their debt and decrease their stress
9141294 hes brought a lot of smiles back a lot of guys were down for the last couple of years having bad defenses being stressed out over losing and donatell brought a lot of positiveness to us a lot of guys got their love back for the game and guys are happy back there now and making plays to better the football team

9141297 we know that were breaking in a new system all those things that go along with it but this group is willing when a group is willing a lot of good things can happen
9141298 when you look up and say we won the game youll say they tackled this team leveraged well those are the key ingredients our total intention is getting the job done
9141299 a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
9141300 the broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w
9141301 a champion for working americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours
9141302 because defenders of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
9141303 cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
9141304 set a clear goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
9141305 same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third
9141306 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief
9141307 with the nomination of sen barack obama tonight the man who will lead the democratic party in its march toward the white house we are making a down payment on the fulfillment of that dream
9141308 not with so much work to be done not with so many children to educate and so many veterans to care for not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend america we cannot turn back we cannot walk alone at this moment in this election we must pledge once more to march into the future let us keep that promise that american promise and in the words of scripture hold firmly without wavering to the hope that we confess
9141309 the release of carbon dioxide is massive in this country
9141310 so tell me mr guccione what exactly did you win this one for
9141311 malcolm just think of him as one of the warner brothers he just signs the cheques
9141312 oh my god i cant believe were going to actually shoot this
9141313 oh malcolm i saw caligula ive seen it three times its frightfully good
9141314 so tell me mr guccione what exactly did you win this one for
9141315 malcolm just think of him as one of the warner brothers he just signs the cheques
9141316 oh my god i cant believe were going to actually shoot this
9141317 oh malcolm i saw caligula ive seen it three times its frightfully good
9141318 so tell me mr guccione what exactly did you win this one for
9141319 malcolm just think of him as one of the warner brothers he just signs the cheques
9141320 oh my god i cant believe were going to actually shoot this
9141321 oh malcolm i saw caligula ive seen it three times its frightfully good
9141322 more than a year after a fatal shooting rocked the evanston community the mother of victim darryl shanon pickett is working to keep her sons name alive and pushing for stricter laws aimed at controlling senseless gun violence
9141323 you know kids fight all the time but nowadays these kids pick up guns because they got in a little fight and under the second amendment they dont have to tell you where they got the gun from they should have to tell you
9141324 sees the fundamental cause of the worlds problems in the very expansion of homo sapiens
9141325 in four short years bush turned that around and we now have debt for years to come
9141326 right now we need to campaign on turning virginia from a red state to a blue state
9141327 im talking to people every day who were republicans forever but are just not able to do it this year
9141328 for years and years they bought the plan to cut taxes but the middle class now is beginning to catch up with that idea and understand that a trick has been pulled on them
9141329 i want to vote for somebody who is going to deliver what he says he is going to do
9141330 forget about the wealthy think about the people and help the middle class rather than the wealthy
9141331 we have got a good start but we have our work cut out for us all across the country
9141332 we need to bring the lost to the light and reap the harvest
9141333 this election if probably one of the most important of my grandchildrens lives
9141334 i think historically we have left behind the disadvantaged and the people the policy was developed for
9141335 i think obama has done things more than any candidate to reach out to my generation
9141336 compare that to john mccain who said he barely knew how to use the internet and had to have help from his wife
9141337 the campaign of barack obama and joe biden is a very exciting one
9141338 we want a change that is going to help us all
9141339 their strength is not only how they campaign but how they govern
9141340 sought to transcend race and find a plane of unity
9141341 stronger than when he arrived but still with a hill to climb
9141342 people are once again looking for a music collection with a face to it as opposed to a hard drive full of music

9141345 suppose i never ever met you suppose we never fell in love suppose i never ever let you kiss me so sweet and so soft
9141346 is iedereen ervan overtuigd dat we naar een dialoog van gemeenschappen moeten is iedereen ervan overtuigd dat het om een grote staatshervorming moet gaan en hoe gaan we onderhandelen met wie en met welk mandaat
9141347 voor mij is er maar n antwoord het is de vlaamse regering die moet onderhandelen de mensen aan de andere kant van de tafel moeten eenzelfde soort mandaat hebben als de mandaten niet gelijk zijn krijg je een praatbarak die geen beslissingen kan nemen ook de vragen naar wat we gaan bespreken en naar de timing zijn belangrijk maar voor mij moet er eerst en vooral een duidelijk antwoord komen op de hoe vraag
9141348 de staatshervorming realiseren vanuit de deelstaten is een zeer belangrijke uitdaging we beleven momenteel een momentum dat we niet mogen verprutsen iedereen moet de ernst van de situatie inzien want als deze dialoog mislukt wordt het echt penibel
9141349 dat was ook jaren aanmodderen omdat vlaanderen iets vroeg en de nederlanders daar geen enkel belang bij hadden dat hebben we pas kunnen oplossen door een langetermijnperspectief in de onderhandelingen te brengen wat is de visie op het schelde estuarium op termijn daar hebben de nederlanders wel belang bij er ontstond een vertrouwensband en het is gelukt
9141350 its all original in terms of the original paint and original wall surfaces
9141351 painters come in here and theyre just kind of floored
9141352 they say this would take months to replicate because they stretched canvas on the walls then painted the canvas
9141353 the other thing we like is the batchelder fireplace tile work batchelder was a prominent tile maker from california in the early part of the century
9141354 its a grape leaf pattern with grapes and vines and its one of the things that needs to be seen
9141355 we hope our kids can catch that spirit that you preserve things
9141356 i came and looked at it and called and said greg youve got to drive up
9141357 then he came outside and saw the sequoia and said
9141358 from the street it has nice appeal but the thing that made me buy it was after i went out back into the yard the giant sequoia
9141359 i think theyre so much a part of our history
9141360 we need to preserve them and live in them and treasure them
9141361 i am very disappointed with your decision to only list a very limited list of daily stock quotes in an effort to save money i have been trying to get my wife to cancel the paper for quite some time she has resisted so far but this is the final straw the only portion i read regularly is the stock quote if there are plans to consider reinstating the stock page in its entirety i would certainly like to know about it otherwise i will not be renewing my subscription
9141362 as is the case with the rest of the paper we are faced with a shrinking newshole to address this challenge we have had to make some hard choices we eliminated the baseball recaps as a way to get the bulk of our major league report on one page doing this is saving us roughly half a page worth of news space per day and we are still providing coverage of the pennant races through our down the stretch feature on the sports cover as well as our game of the day on or next to the baseball page
9141363 removing the recaps wasnt done lightly but it really came down to a choice of continuing to run them or pulling back on our local coverage of the jazz the utes the cougars etc and thats really not an option high level coverage of those and other local teams and athletes are what the vast majority of our readers want its what has made us one of the top 10 sports sections in the nation for a paper of our size
9141364 were planning to bring back the recaps next summer when there isnt as much going on and were going to keep talking and brainstorming if we can find a way to reinvent the recaps in a way that wont eat up so much space well do it but for the time being we felt this was the way to continue giving our readers what is most important to them
9141365 ik had met 5 1 of 5 3 kunnen winnen maar liet een paar kansen onbenut
9141366 eigenlijk verdiende hawkins het om de wedstrijd te winnen maar ik denk dat de zenuwen hem parten speelden in het laatste frame ik heb in de zomer een lange pauze genoten en was wat onzeker hoe ik het er hier vanaf zou brengen al bij al valt dat dus mee dat ik carter om de wereldtitel versloeg betekent niets het wk is geschiedenis hier beginnen we allebei weer van nul

9141372 its a tool in the toolbox its not the only thing were going to rely on
9141373 every season you deal with concussions and how they affect the team
9141374 it sometimes can be very detrimental to a team if a kid doesnt recover quickly from them or if theres not a measure to help determine return to play if they return too quickly theres lots of other problems that can occur with that
9141375 ideally itd be good to have a baseline test on every high school athlete

9141382 we dont have the time to go out and be the true workers which are the volunteers that spend a year in africa

9141392 completes a pattern of hyped one sided reportage that goes back a while
9141393 the women in johns early life truly shaped who he became
9141394 and the strengths and weaknesses of their relationships are central to this film
9141395 completes a pattern of hyped one sided reportage that goes back a while
9141396 i would like to ask the distinguished representative of the united states weapons of mass destruction have you found them yet in iraq or are you still looking for them
9141397 im not a psychologist and i dont know what brought on the free association we heard from ambassador churkin
9141398 it is a big mistake for us to grant any validity to international law even when it may seem in our short term interest to do so because over the long term the goal of those who think that international law really means anything are those who want to constrict the united states
9141399 when i was here i didnt take any courses at all on international law and frankly i dont think i missed a thing
9141400 and were going to listen to all these speeches then were going to go back to mississippi and get called racial epithets again this isnt going to change anything
9141401 he mentioned that he didnt want his children to be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character he was looking to the future with hope and faith that this grand land of america would someday accept all people barack obamas nomination is a fulfillment of that dream
9141402 god would never tell anyone not to use their gifts for the church
9141403 well my church isnt like that why dont you come see
9141404 then his liver and kidney failed and his heart stopped
9141405 we started making our own money and after he graduated from north in 1966 he went on the road
9141406 he started really hitting it big with frank sinatra and all the big ones and i stayed behind he came back to southern indiana in 1984
9141407 he was a master he was a genius he was a creator
9141408 gov palin and john mccain are a good match because they both want to overturn roe v wade they both want to continue the failed economic policies of the bush administration and they both offer more of the same
9141409 were going to beat the hell out of em in november
9141410 people who understand him know hell say whatever he wants to say
9141411 he will never give a speech on just one topic ever
9141412 last night hillary told us in no uncertain terms she is going to do everything she can to elect barack obama
9141413 hillary moving for acclamation just put the good housekeeping stamp of approval on the whole thing
9141414 it totally worked i told you it would create more unity than trying to force unity by ignoring the divisions
9141415 i never had any doubt that hillary would do what she did she is a true star putting the country ahead of herself
9141416 individuals create the meaning and essence of their lives as opposed to it being created for them by deities or authorities or defined for them by philosophical or theological doctrines
9141417 man is defined only in so far as he acts and he is responsible for his actions to clarify it can be said that a man who acts cruelly towards other people is by that act defined as a cruel man and in that same instance he as opposed to his genes for instance is defined as being responsible for being this cruel man of course the more positive therapeutic aspect of this is also implied you can choose to act in a different way and to be a good person instead of a cruel person here it is also clear that since man can choose to be either cruel or good he is in fact neither of these things essentially
9141418 terms used by existentialists first attributed to danish philosopher s ren kierkegaard 1813 1855 in
9141419 in a circle of true friends each man is simply what he is stands for nothing but himself no one cares twopence about any one elses family profession class income race or previous history that is the kingliness of friendship we meet like sovereign princes of independent states abroad on neutral ground freed from our contexts
9141420 i cannot quite understand why a man should wish to know more people than he can make real friends of surprised by joy
9141421 weve got to go back and evaluate all the information that weve compiled over the last six months its going to be a tough decision
9141422 weve said before a lot of times when matt doesnt play well he seems to respond and play with a chip on his shoulder
9141423 we knew there were going to be a lot of things involved and that it was going to have to play itself out
9141424 we got a chance to evaluate a lot of second and third team players
9141425 we had some great competition out there well go back look at that film later on tonight early in the morning and make some decisions tomorrow who our top 53 guys will be
9141426 has taught him something that career politicians often overlook that inconvenient truths must be acknowledged if we are to have wise governance
9141427 because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change
9141428 hes said many times that the primary battle was historic and exciting and that in the end result it would be good for the democratic party that it would energize a lot of people and bring a lot of new people out
9141429 he expected all along that this would resolve itself elegantly and organically and it did
9141430 i think hes very happy with where we are we have a nominee a spectacular nominee and hes going to do everything he can to see him elected
9141431 we think gore can deliver a compelling message on both the economy and foreign policy as relates to energy
9141432 hes a messenger there are a lot of elected officials that voters dont readily accept information from and hes one that they do they think that hes got credibility he has some credibility because a lot of voters believe that if he were elected the last eight years would have been different
9141433 what he has said is that he is not interested in serving in a future administration but that he hasnt ruled out public office and that if he ran for office again it would probably be for president
9141434 he has found a very unique role and platform as a kind of public private citizen able to harness resources creatively to make a huge impact on the climate crisis
9141435 in a stadium like this it felt like one living organism
9141436 people are really going to see which venue looks more like america and its this one
9141437 he thoroughly and compellingly explained his plan for change with specific distinctions between what government should be responsible for and personal responsibility
9141438 we must also admit that programs alone cant replace parents that government cant turn off the television and make a child do her homework that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need
9141439 i cant imagine why youd have a hard time making up your mind
9141440 its important to understand how our democracy works not just looking on television but to participate is important to me
9141441 i believe we wouldnt be in iraq in his administration mcnally said
9141442 i think you get the handlers in there and you just get lost
9141443 kill not your children for fear of want it is i who provide sustenance for them as well as for you for verily killing them is a great sin
9141444 when the female infant buried alive is questioned for what crime she was killed 81 8 9
9141445 views of saint augustine who said the law does not provide that the act abortion pertains to homicide for there cannot yet be said to be a live soul in a body that lacks sensation
9141446 even during the cold war during the harsh confrontation between the soviet union and the united states we always avoided direct clashes between our civilians even more so between our military personnel
9141447 ordinary experts even if they teach military affairs should not do so in combat zones but in training areas and training centers
9141448 what was the purpose of that gentleman being among the special forces and what is he doing today i so far cannot answer
9141449 as a follow up to my below post picking a female vp makes it very difficult for obama to execute the second part of his strategy painting mccain as the same as bush
9141450 maybe they wont notice that i am taking john mccains straight talk express campaign themes
9141451 i dont think so america knows mccain just sold out the country for a politic tactical stunt the woman has no experience on diversity of economics no national experience with any issue if the 72 year old kicks the bucket so would we as a country this woman is soooooo under qualified
9141452 now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws so that your pensions are protected ahead of ceo bonuses
9141453 orangina is a drink which is mainly aimed at children and young people
9141454 the almost sinister portrayal of animals in an animation style filled with sexual innuendo leads to very mixed and confused messages
9141455 alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
9141456 seeing barack for who he is neither white nor black but a man who can be president
9141457 the question for the american people is whether they can make this odyssey that democratic delegates to the convention made seeing barack for who he is neither white nor black but a man who can be president
9141458 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
9141459 washingtons been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
9141460 in that time hes said no to higher fuel efficiency standards for cars no to investments in renewable energy no to renewable fuels and today we import triple the amount of oil as the day that senator mccain took office
9141461 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
9141462 i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power
9141463 ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america
9141464 ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars
9141465 and ill invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
9141466 both candidates are talking about energy high prices and global warming so its important to look past the rhetoric and see what is at the heart of their plans
9141467 as this scorecard illustrates the contrast in this election could not be starker
9141468 barack obama wants to give tax relief and 1 000 energy rebates to working families while john mccain wants billions more in tax breaks for oil companies making more than 1 000 a second in profits
9141469 thats why i came here tonight to tell you why i feel so strongly that we must seize this opportunity to elect barack obama president of the united states of america
9141470 we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving it
9141471 we are facing a planetary emergency which if not solved would exceed anything weve ever experienced in the history of humankind
9141472 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the future of human civilization
9141473 many scientists predict shockingly that the entire north polar ice cap may be completely gone during summer months during the first term of the next president
9141474 sea levels are rising fires are raging storms are stronger military experts warn us our national security is threatened by massive waves of climate refugees destabilizing countries around the world and scientists tell us the very web of life is endangered by unprecedented extinctions
9141475 in spite of john mccains past record of open mindedness and leadership on the climate crisis he has now apparently allowed his party to browbeat him into abandoning his support of mandatory caps on global warming pollution
9141476 the carbon fuels industry big oil and coal have a 50 year lease on the republican party and they are drilling it for everything its worth
9141477 that america is the best country on earth and a place where everybody if they work hard can achieve great things
9141478 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
9141479 the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar
9141480 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
9141481 if like me you still believe america must always be a place called hope
9141482 i went on a trip to europe with my father and mother
9141483 and everywhere we went we were met by vast crowds of people hundreds of thousands of people who came out into the street because they wanted to be near to an american politician and it wasnt because his brother had been martyred three years before
9141484 our nation was the most loved nation on the face of the earth because we were regarded as an exemplary nation
9141485 it took 230 years of discipline restraint and visionary leadership by republican and democratic presidents to build up those vast reservoirs of love and adoration for the united states for the past seven years through monumental arrogance and incompetence we have drained those reservoirs dry anyone who thinks its good for our country when hezbollah is more popular in the middle east than the us has their head in an oil well
9141486 his life has been the 21st century incarnation of the american dream
9141487 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive because next week in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third and we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight on nov 4 we must stand up and say eight is enough
9141488 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
9141489 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
9141490 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter take it from me if it had ended differently we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis we would be fighting for middle income families
9141491 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000 though it may be even more obvious now because john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them gore said
9141492 the same policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
9141493 too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
9141494 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the startups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
9141495 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
9141496 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
9141497 the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time
9141498 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
9141499 oh can you take care of her oh maybe you can spare her several moments of your consideration leading up to the final destination
9141500 oh the earth is calling out i wanna learn what its all about but everything i read global warming going green i dont know what all this means but it seems to be saying wake up america
9141501 hes a hero hes going to bring pollution down to zero
9141502 i know that you dont want to hear it especially coming from someone so young
9141503 stand up ill try if you will wake up its not a fire drill
9141504 jennifer is in talks to have a guest spot on one of their high profile shows the top choice is 30 rock but if that doesnt work out theyll try to find another show for her to make an appearance on
9141505 its simply if you and i can carry on a very simple conversation
9141506 to learn the game and know the rules of our club you need to know them and theyre in english
9141507 people were applying for membership that were unable to speak english beyond hello that was it they would bring interpreters to help them with the application or inquiry for membership
9141508 unfortunately once the interpreter was gone the member was on his own or her own and unfortunately did not know the rules and regulations and were breaking them all
9141509 ive invited the members to brush up on their english take some courses and to come back and reapply and we have gladly talked to them and taken them through the process
9141510 they have told me they were going to go back to either japan korea hong kong or wherever it may be with plans to take courses
9141511 i am not going to judge the golf club but this is an opportunity for our community to work together to find solutions
9141512 theres no doubt the rule is exclusionary and on its face discriminatory but i dont think there is a legal remedy from the associations point of view i dont think we would want to impose a legal remedy on private clubs in the sense that we would want to give the state the power to force people to overturn peoples free and private choices about who they want to play or who they want to have join the club

9141530 those who become christians become new persons they are not the same anymore for the old life is gone a new life has begun
9141531 we desperately want to have hope for the new century
9141532 for all have sinned all fall short of gods standard
9141533 god showed his great love for us by sending christ to die for us
9141534 god made christ who never sinned to be the offering for our sin so that we could be made right with god through christ
9141535 i assure you those who listen to my message and believe in god who sent me have eternal life they will never be condemned for their sins but they have already passed from death into life
9141536 look here i stand at the door and knock if you hear me calling and open the door i will come in
9141537 there has been no improvement in the ground situation so far hence the conditions are still not conducive for resuming work today
9141538 it has no single lead agency to combat terrorism while terrorism has aggressively progressed in the country the premier investigating agency the cbi has progressively regressed from its professionalism the cbi has become emblematic of politicisation of investigation in the country
9141539 the department of state is extremely sensitive to your concerns and we are cognizant of the human rights abuses modi has committed
9141540 we have thoroughly searched department records and located no current non immigrant visa applications for modi however should we receive an application we assure you it will be adjudicated in strict accordance with the immigration and naturalisation act
9141541 the current response from the state department has virtually made narendra modi a persona non grata to the us
9141542 there is no question of changes cosmetic or otherwise what we are really asking is there are certain issues on which there are certain red lines drawn by us because those are the commitments that had been made by our prime minister
9141543 on red lines we cannot thats what we told our parliament that these are sacrosanct and if these are not met we cannot endorse the agreement
9141544 we have always made the point that testing is a word that we find difficult to adjust to not because of anything else but because that is what parliament has mandated us to do
9141545 i presume testing will be difficult for us to so we will find ways around it we are clear that whatever we finally agree to in nsg should be something that we can sell to parliament
9141546 hopefully we will find a way on it i think it will be possible for us to surmount some of these obstacles
9141547 nsg does not have ban on enrichment and reprocessing technology transfer per se unlike the us none of the countries have ban in their countries on transfer of enrichment and reprocessing technology
9141548 we dont want some countries individual predilections to be performing part of huge package of items in the nsg
9141549 it is uncalled for we have put all the cards on the table we have been as transparent as anyone else we are willing to make our case before the nsg we do not understand the need for the review mechanism
9141550 if we have periodic reviews they investors will say it should not be done
9141551 our concerns are well known i think most of the countries recognised the validity of our concerns there are some countries who i think are ideologically committed to their concepts of non proliferation and hence tend to take a sort of hardline position on this
9141552 i think it is a question of convincing them that india with an impeccable record in terms of non proliferation the fact that it has always stood for universal nuke disarmament is a right candidate for nuclear commerce
9141553 as long as it does not inhibit us from what we believe is clean and unconditional waiver
9141554 i am optimistic but i will not allow optimism to override caution
9141555 the work is in progress and i cannot tell you the details
9141556 yes constant dialogue is going on between new delhi and the us

9141568 this fall well be starting the substance substantial internship program
9141569 it was a long run and the ball was beating me there
9141570 i kind of caught the ball but i was going face first into the wall so i ate the green monster i tasted it too it was pretty nasty
9141571 that was one of my favorites man because i went face and everyone talked about me it felt like mike tyson hit me it was ludicrous
9141572 thats pretty high on the list its a weird angle out there in that outfield and im still trying to make the adjustment but the warning track is so good i can determine the surface out there from grass to dirt to the warning track
9141573 i knew it was coming up so i just had to make a leap for it it was beating me there and i caught it
9141574 let me tell you if we dont have a guy like torii were not going to make that play
9141575 when he byrd hit it i was like thats gone but i saw him jump and he showed the ball and i was like hes the one

9141582 why did the senior us leadership allow their citizens to be present there when they had no right to be in the security zone and if they allowed it i begin to suspect that it was done intentionally to organise a small victorious war

9141664 i want my daughters to have the exact same opportunities as your sons
9141665 its time for us to change america and thats why im running for president
9141666 we love this country too much to let enroute to invesco field thousands of people flow along colfax to hear barack obama speak thursday at the conclusion to the democratic national convention in denver on august 28 2008 the denver post sean hiller the next four years look like the last eight
9141667 what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time
9141668 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
9141669 who made a case for change as only he can make it
9141670 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
9141671 one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
9141672 has the good judgement to know that we should not risk the lives of our brave soldiers in the wrong war
9141673 like another son of illinois he has spoken to a divided people about the better angeles of our nature
9141674 when we talk about an open convention this is what democrats meant
9141675 were here for the millions of americans whove been knocked down to show that were going to get back up as a nation
9141676 were here for the next president of the united states barack obama
9141677 youll be happy to know that im looking forward to voting for barack obama in november
9141678 so i learned at an early age to value freedom and the ideals of american
9141679 we shall nobly save or meanly lose the last best hope of the earth
9141680 let us restore the hope and bring the change that our nation needs
9141681 our cohesiveness as a nation is strained by multiple crises in finance and credit energy and health care
9141682 on the killing fields of picketts charge our country came of age and assured for all time that our nation would survive as one
9141683 after they wrecked our economy its time for a change
9141684 after they abandoned the search for the terrorists who attacked us and redeployed the troops to invade a nation that did not attack us its time for a change
9141685 powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse
9141686 barack obamas vision and his voice represent the best of america
9141687 it is that common american identity which barack obama exemplifies heart and soul that enables us as americans to speak with moral authority to all of the people of the world
9141688 the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
9141689 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the future of human civilization
9141690 sea levels are rising fires are raging storms are stronger
9141691 take it from me if it had ended differently we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him
9141692 we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis we would be fighting for middle income families and we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving it
9141693 barack obama and joe biden believe we must fight the terrorists not where we imagine them to be but where we know them to be
9141694 we must lead a global effort to secure loose nuclear materials not where we imagine them to be but where we know them to be
9141695 i have a question for you is anybody here going to miss dick cheney
9141696 to put american workers first and rebuild the middle class with a president who supports unions and the rights of workers to organize
9141697 my fellow delegates are you ready to take our country back lets do it
9141698 strive for better schools economic justice and smarter foreign policies

9141703 here at the foot of the great rocky mountains our greatest mountains we need leaders to match these mountains
9141704 we will march as we never have before to elect the next president of the united states sen barack obama
9141705 on this day exactly 45 years ago my father stood on the national mall in the shadow of abraham lincoln and proclaimed i have a dream

9141707 let us give our nation a leader who has heard this clarion call and will help us achieve the change we still need barack obama
9141708 on that day his words and his example inspired an entire generation of young and old rich and poor
9141709 tonight we gather here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
9141710 for the past eight years weve had two oilmen in the white house and where has it gotten us
9141711 record prices at the gas pump heating oil costs going through the roof oil companies reaping record profits while american families struggle to put gas in the tank
9141712 i say solar here solar now wind here wind now
9141713 we will elect barack obama as the next president of the united states of america
9141714 we need to stop paying lip service to health care reform and just pass it we need to protect a womens right to choose and access to affordable family planning and health care and we need to bring our troops home
9141715 we say today we will not be satisfied with four more years of the same under john mccain
9141716 we need to stop talking about ending the war in iraq and just do it
9141717 if god doesnt live in colorado ill bet thats where he spends most of his time
9141718 its about a set of american ideals that offer hope and unity and the promise of change
9141719 its about binding people together with common goals shared visions and the pioneering spirit that defines all of america
9141720 road to the white house cuts straight through the heart of the american west
9141721 were thrilled to have this magnificent crowd here with us tonight
9141722 in america great leaders have always seized the chance for change
9141723 tonight no matter where you come from or the language you speak i am asking you elect barack obama president because he will fight for us
9141724 down to earth knows more about foreign policy than anybody else in the senate
9141725 this is the last one ill be able to go to i feel all right i woke up breathing this morning
9141726 we want to get the whole experience of the whole day this is a minor inconvenience
9141727 we knew it was going to take a while but we didnt think it would be this long
9141728 everythings good real peaceful protesters are following what they said they would do
9141729 its not just about the last 7 years its about moving forward resuming our role in world leadership
9141730 i want the sun the waiting in line the whole experience im standing in line for my grandchildren
9141731 im 77 been waiting all my life for this so standing in line here doesnt bother me at all
9141732 that theres peace here harmony and order and that whats going on here radiates
9141733 this isnt like just a football game its a historical moment something you can take to your grave knowing you were part of history
9141734 truth i took into consideration that journalists and ardent supporters
9141735 numerous times to talk about wooten as well as frank bailey from the governors office and commissioner of administration annete krietzer who also pressured him to fire wooten
9141736 when made aware of the security concerns regarding a state trooper i instructed the first gentleman to contact the commissioner of public safety it is standard protocol to ask every governor about any threats they perceive or have realized
9141737 i will not hesitate to set the record straight in answering these false allegations by former commissioner monegan
9141738 there was never any direction by the governor never any direction by todd to make the call or to make any call to dps on this stuff
9141739 todd and sarah are scratching their heads why on earth hasnt why is this guy still representing the department hes a horrible recruiting tool you know i mean from their perspective everyones protecting him
9141740 its embarrassing for me to disclose at this time a conversation has occurred again unbeknownst to me
9141741 silence kincaid talks to the dead its not the easiest thing for a teenage girl to bear but no one asked her if she wanted to be a freak in the first place they come to her and sometimes just sometimes shes able to help them when a vampire comes to her and asks her to help him prove that hes not a killer she worries that maybe shes getting in over her head but what she doesnt know is that ghost talkers are born to swim in deep waters
9141742 but these instructors teachers in a general sense personnel who trained others to work on the supplied military equipment are supposed to be in training centers and where were they in the military operations zone
9141743 why did the senior us leadership allow their citizens to be present there when they had no right to be in the security zone and if they allowed it i begin to suspect that it was done intentionally to organise a small victorious war
9141744 and if that failed they wanted to create an enemy out of russia and unite voters around one of the presidential candidates of course a ruling party candidate because it is only the ruling party that has this kind of resource
9141745 we have long ago recognised the borders of modern day ukraine
9141746 we have an agreement with ukraine about maintaining the presence of our fleet until the year 2017 and we will implement that agreement
9141747 if i were to say that we dont care that we were indifferent i would be lying
9141748 of course will leave these positions where we are now we will not remain there forever
9141749 our goal is only to provide security in the region
9141750 no moral right to the role of mentor in matters of international relations and to judge the actions of other states

9141770 no se puede aplicar una tasa o precio p blico a ning n servicio si antes no se ha aprobado en pleno y por supuesto sin satisfacer el canon correspondiente a costas
9141771 es cierto lo que aduce cifre pero concurren en este caso unos atenuantes en favor de la actuaci n del adjudicatario
9141772 la explicaci n que nos dieron es coherente seg n la asociaci n de vecinos se ha puesto un precio simb lico para evitar nica y exclusivamente que la instalaci n se deteriore
9141773 en dos d as todo est sucio pintarrajeado y degradado pero con un precio simb lico s lo accede quien quiere usarlo
9141774 el problema no est tanto en la finalidad como en el m todo
9141775 qui n dice que el precio estipulado es el ideal qui n dice que es simb lico y no lucrativo cu nto se recauda al d a creo que son cuestiones que el ayuntamiento no deber a tomar tan a la ligera pues estamos hablando de unos ba os los nicos de una playa que es usada cada d a por miles de personas
9141776 este a o todo se ha tenido que hacer algo deprisa
9141777 para el pr ximo a o el ayuntamiento debatir en pleno un precio p blico debidamente informado por los t cnicos

9141789 wenn es jemals etwas gab das ein hass verbrechen darstellt dann dieses
9141790 stellen sie sich vor man h tte jemanden gekidnappt und jetzt flehen sie dass dieser mensch bitte wieder zu seiner geliebten familie zur ckkehren kann
9141791 alle weil ich unh flich gegen ber einem keks gewesen bin
9141792 in 25 davon wurde mir gesagt ich solle stattdessen eine kopie des korans entweihen oder auf hnliche weise muslime beleidigen weil anscheinend nur einige religi se ikonen gesch tzt werden m ssen und ich w rde ja nur katholiken beleidigen weil sie alle so nett w ren und mir keiner von ihnen je ein leid w nschen w rde ich habe sogar eine mail erhalten in der stand ich sollte gefeuert werden dass ihr verfasser mich gerne umbringen m chte und dass ich nur katholiken kritisiere weil diese so sanftm tig und nett seien
9141793 einen rostigen nagel in eine gesegnete hostie gesteckt sie zusammen mit rausgerissenen seiten des koran und dawkins gotteswahn in den m ll geworfen und das moderne kunstwerk mit kaffeepulver und einer bananenschale verziert die reaktionen von religi ser seite sind jedoch nicht wie erwartet man h tte angenommen dass der religionskritiker zumindest ein paar todesdrohungen von aufgebrachten muslimen erh lt oder dass eine flagge mit seinem pharyngula embryo verbrannt wird nichts dergleichen ist geschehen pz myers hat bis zum heutigen tage nicht einmal eine h fliche beschwerde von muslimen erhalten nicht eine obwohl er das heiligste heiligtum des islam zerrissen und in den m ll geworfen hat stattdessen erhielt er hunderte von todesdrohungen von aufgebrachten r mischen katholiken
9141794 ich wollte dir nur eine nachricht schicken dass wenn jemand bekannt gibt er habe deine frau mary und deine kinder alaric connlann und skatje entf hrt sie brutal vergewaltigt get tet und sie in eine m lltonne geworfen und dann dar ber gelacht und damit angegeben dann wirst du einen ersten eindruck davon haben welchen zorn du bei vielen guten menschen erregt hast
9141795 du bist ein drecksack sollen deine eingeweide verrotten jemand soll dein genick mit einem stiefel mit stahlkappe am bordstein zerbrechen ich hoffe f r eine welt ohne liberale wir k nnen mit dir anfangen
9141796 religionsfreiheit bedeutet dass niemand das recht hat eine religi se tradition anzugreifen sie b sartig oder auf widerw rtige weise zu beleidigen von der er kein mitglied ist oder der er keine loyalit t schuldig ist
9141797 die heiligsten sakramente einer religion anzugreifen ist genausowenig meinungsfreiheit wie es meineid vor gericht oder verleumdung in einer zeitung w re l gen und hassreden die zur gewalt anstacheln werden nicht von dem gesetz gesch tzt aus diesem grund ist es genausowenig von der verfassung gedeckt wenn jemand hakenkreuze an eine synagoge pinselt oder ffentlich exemplare der bibel oder des korans verbrennt
9141798 f r den schutz einer hostie w rde ich mich wenn es sein muss umbringen lassen
9141799 nur nicht provozieren die verr ckten k nnten b se werden
9141800 da ich im moment so viele ideen habe habe ich weder zeit krank zu werden noch alt zu werden
9141801 die kommunikation sollte dringend verbessert werden damit die verunsicherungs und angstkampagne nicht weiter so erfolgreich wirkt
9141802 langfristig werden wir erhebliche steuermehreinnahmen haben und den break even in wenigen jahren nach fertigstellung erreichen wir sind die reichste gro stadt in deutschland und das wollen wir auch bleiben
9141803 the product is outstanding and makes thedesign statement i was looking for
9141804 and still she slept an azure lidded sleep in blanched linen smooth and lavender d
9141805 yet another sign that old barriers are falling in our politics
9141806 he told her she would be a terrific candidate and that he looked forward to seeing her on the campaign trail
9141807 he also wished her good luck but not too much luck
9141808 former mayor of a town with 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9141809 i think that uh you know campaigns start getting these uh hair triggers and uh the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments
9141810 its not that sarah palin is too inexperienced its that john mccain thinks she is qualified to be president and she is less experienced that obama
9141811 john mccain does not get what ordinary people here in beaver pa are going through
9141812 here is a guy who said we have made great economic progress under george bush i dont think you have seen this economic progress here in beaver pa
9141813 i can remember being one of a small group of people who came to bill ayers house to learn that alice palmer was stepping down from the senate and running for congress
9141814 john mccain does not get what ordinary people here in beaver pa are going through
9141815 there might be a chance we survive eight years of bush i dont know thats where the hope comes in
9141816 barack obamas message of hope has inspired americans all across the country and we couldnt imagine a more fitting place for robert indiana to unveil his hope sculpture than at the convergence of this movement for change in denver
9141817 the boat was overcrowded because people panicked to be rescued and clambered on board

9141829 with both oil and gasoline inventories much lower than when katrina and rita hit the price consequences could be even worse this time
9141830 while supply disruptions and attendant price hikes will be temporary there will be lasting impacts from hurricane damage on future supply growth as there have already been from the 2005 storm season
9141831 the general trend to gasoline prices would be flat to slightly lower reflecting a sort of underlying slowing global growth and therefore a slowdown in demand for crude oil
9141832 if there is damage to infrastructure if rigs are offline for more than just a few days for precautionary reasons then you could see oil and gasoline prices move upward temporarily

9141835 wehner and two engineers lenny oliker and john shalf also of lawrence berkeley have proposed perhaps the most powerful special purpose computer yet it is intended to model changes in climatic patterns over periods as long as a century specifically it should be able to remedy todays inability to model clouds well enough to tell whether their net effect is to warm the world or cool it to solve the problem climatologists figure they need to deal in chunks of the atmosphere measuring 1kilometer on a side a job for an exaflop machine one with 1000 times more computing power than even roadrunner can provide
9141836 the researchers are now trying to validate their claims with a hardware mock up which they are building in collaboration with tensilica a custom chip supplier in santa clara calif the plan is to bench test a single processor by november and a parallel array of processors by the middle of 2009 if the claims are vindicated the researchers hope to get government funding for a full size machine
9141837 critics of special purpose machines say theyve heard it all before
9141838 the problem is that when we devise a new way to solve a problem the machine designed for the old way will no longer be as good
9141839 but according to horst simon who heads the lawrence berkeley labs research computing center the proposed machine would not be so specialized that a new algorithm would render it instantly obsolete
9141840 we are building hardware that runs not just one algorithm but a large class of related algorithms he says
9141841 earthquake risks in the greater new york city area are reassessed in a major study released today by a team of seismologists based at columbia universitys lamont doherty earth observatory palisades n y though the report reaffirms that large earthquakes are relatively rare in new york it finds that fault patterns are more complex than previously appreciated in particular two fault systems are found to converge very close to the controversial indian point nuclear power plant 24 miles north of the city
9141842 the authors of the study catalogued 383 earthquakes from 1677 to 2007 and in those three plus centuries identified three magnitude 5 quakes capable of causing serious damage they estimate that a potentially catastrophic category 6 quake might occur every 370 years and a category 7 every 3 400 years though those probabilities are relatively low the damage risk from a new york city earthquake is still very high because of the citys concentration of people and physical infrastructure observes lynn sykes the very eminent seismologist who led the study

9141854 he was definitely outplaying me for the first two sets i felt like a little kid out here playing against him
9141855 and then the clock struck 12 and i started playing well as a 26 year old
9141856 i was disappointed in the second set i think i should have finished it
9141857 i wouldnt have won the match already but it would have been a big step

9141880 perhaps the relevant truth and its one whose existence was apparent to my wife and im sure to much of the world long before it became apparent to me is that we all find ourselves in temporal currents and that unless youre paying attention youll discover often too late that an undertow of weeks or years has pulled you deep into trouble
9141881 no matter how much our message is ignored or ridiculed as was done in the campaign no matter how much they did to us it only energized our grass roots
9141882 our focus is really on this side of the river
9141883 we think theres enough excitement and energy on this side

9141904 because defenders of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
9141905 cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class

9141910 not with so much work to be done not with so many children to educate and so many veterans to care for not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend america we cannot turn back we cannot walk alone at this moment in this election we must pledge once more to march into the future let us keep that promise that american promise and in the words of scripture hold firmly without wavering to the hope that we confess

9141914 we have way too much gasoline gas is down to 19 cents a gallon and the oil companies are hurting i know that i am partly to blame by insisting that cars run on trash i am therefore proposing a federal bail out to our oil companies because hey if it were the other way around you know the oil companies would help us
9141915 i think he brought it to a new level of attention and validity that we hadnt had before
9141916 al gore has been warning us of the dangers of climate change for more than twenty years
9141917 when al won an academy award for his fine documentary an inconvenient truth i was thrilled america was finally listening to the lecture hed given me every week for eight years
9141918 he had written a great book before he was chosen as vice president
9141919 its easy to take shots its part of being a public figure and being in public office you catch a lot of arrows
9141920 al gore knew more about the importance of the rain forest than the scientists
9141921 i asked him a couple of questions and he began a tutorial flying 30 000 feet over the rain forest he told us how the important the rain forest was to the environment and how it affected weather patterns i didnt know that stuff it was one of those life changing moments that ill never forget
9141922 the other 52 percent will say she damaged him too much and five or six of us will say you should have let us do our job

9141929 i was able to finance it slowly myself on a pay as you go basis
9141930 there was never a point where i suddenly had to pay out large amounts of cash
9141931 if you think at six months youll be selling a million dollars of something everyone else is selling thats unrealistic
9141932 it was a risk but we saw it as a calculated risk
9141933 if you look around the industry its been really stagnant and we had found a way to break out of that

9141941 but mentally he has that killer instinct eddie guardado had he can run a pitch up there 92 93 miles an hour and sink it and he goes right after anybody
9141942 nothing worries him hes the kind of guy you want on your side
9141943 i didnt have one easy inning they fought me every pitch
9141944 hes like a little pit bull corky comes into every game all fired up and if you make a play behind him he winds up pumping you up hes so excited
9141945 roy knows what hes doing he knows how to pitch
9141946 he gets ahead of the hitter and every fastball he throws sinks if its really working that sinker just fools hitters because hes got a deceptive delivery
9141947 you dont see it in the standings but were making progress as a team
9141948 were putting better at bats together making their pitch work harder were playing pretty good baseball
9141949 it was a tough game all the way and the last three innings i was pretty nervous
9141950 you have to keep it in perspective and start with the obvious its a lot more fun when you have more to play for
9141951 but come on this is what all of us have wanted to do all our lives play baseball
9141952 there are good guys in this clubhouse and they care it matters to us its more fun when you win yes but just getting the chance to try is something special
9141953 we had that play dialed up all week on that first touchdown pass
9141954 its what weve talked about all along were bringing back a lot of experience on offense and they did pretty good
9141955 that was the big thing we had a couple on offense that killed some drives and just too many on defense
9141956 we let them battle every time you take a snap out there its a good lesson

9141959 the iraqi surge is the major differentiator with previous operations
9141960 we feel better more secure and safe we can go outside without being frightened
9141961 security can freeze diyala so it doesnt get any worse but politics is needed to solve it
9141962 the only way of really solving diyala is through the political roots such as provincial elections and a more balanced provincial council
9141963 the last two weeks spring wheat prices have been teeter tottering up and down but more up than down
9141964 weve seen a 65 cent per bushel gain over the past couple weeks
9141965 at times there seems to be no solid rhyme or reason for this price rise although there is a lot of volatility still in the market
9141966 after last year and the small supplies any issues in wheat producing areas seem to raise concerns
9141967 usdas report didnt really show any significant news for corn and soybeans but this years crop is so far behind in term of development and harvesting that production numbers are uncertain
9141968 usdas supply and demand report was definitely bearish for wheat
9141969 world wheat production was increased by 240 million bushels and were now looking at a world crop of 24 7 billion bushels it just keeps going up month after month
9141970 the export pace has dropped off in recent weeks sales as of aug 14 were at 85 million bushels which is down 30 percent from last years above average level however demand for u s wheat in general has been strong with sales of almost 34 million bushels for the current week which helps support all wheat prices
9141971 most of the news regarding wheat has been bearish but were still seeing prices go up i think there is still a lot of anxiety about the final hard red spring wheat number
9141972 im not trying to prove anything here i consider this adapting to the environment
9141973 if i was still on level ground like i was before in the other storms i know i would be dreading gustav
9141974 there still tends to be more value put on the things we would like to show our neighbors
9141975 i feel a lot better now though because at least i know i will have a home to come back to
9141976 its like youve been slapped so hard in the past that you can almost still feel it i just know how much work it was rebuilding everything
9141977 this has all the ingredients of one of the worst ive seen
9141978 its going to rain at some point we just hope the right thunderstorm doesnt park over this drainage
9141979 if you can envision a thousand cement trucks parked on the hills and dumping their load all at once coming down the hillside
9141980 it is a real concern for a lot of people
9141981 theyre not top dog anymore theyre at the bottom of the ladder so to speak
9141982 they get to hear from their teachers ask questions walk through their schedule and see what supplies are needed
9141983 the parents have a lot of jitters too when sending kids to middle school
9141984 some fifth graders may be used to it by the second day of school while other students may be used to it in a month
9141985 its probably good to review your routine a week before school starts but not before that
9141986 discuss the routine and get it started that helps with anxiety
9141987 if theres a child thats extra anxious and crying what we try to do is to have the parents kiss them good bye and we take them by the hand
9141988 i think the parents worry that theyre going to keep crying typically the kids are fine
9141989 as a parent i would encourage my daughter to call her friends just give them a ring before school starts and find out what are they going to wear what did they get in terms of school supplies
9141990 a lot of times kids feel like they have to know who theyre sitting with as soon as they get to school but they have a few hours to set up who theyre going to have lunch with
9141991 we like to tell kids just be patient give it a chance
9141992 the first week is a lot of getting used to the school like going over the student handbook and getting to know the teachers and classrooms
9141993 were very open to parents e mailing and calling because parent communication is important
9141994 i just want to prove to myself what type of player i am
9141995 if i meet my standards everyone will be able to judge and i think they will be satisfied i just want to prove it to myself
9141996 i dont look at it that way because i feel like theyve been playing a lot of football even though they havent
9141997 but factually and statistically they dont own a lot of starts under their belts
9141998 its going to be fun its going to be a battle
9141999 but i just take it as it is i know hes a good player but im not caught up in that i just want to go out there and do what i have to do

9142034 it was rightly noted in denver this week that hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america

9142037 she knows where she comes from and she knows who she works for she stands up for whats right and she doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down
9142038 is this really who the republican party wants to be one heartbeat away from the presidency
9142039 certainly the choice of palin puts to rest any argument about inexperience on the democratic team her inexperience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling

9142044 any candidacy of any woman with young children raises questions
9142045 its been an argument to discredit women historically and its going to raise some interesting questions particularly among conservatives

9142050 were trusting that gov palin is able to make that decision for her family
9142051 shes choosing life shes been married for 20 years and supported all kinds of wonderful policies we have no reason to doubt shes putting her family first and were confident in her ability to make that decision for herself
9142052 a cynical effort to appeal to disappointed hillary clinton voters and get them to vote ultimately against their own self interest
9142053 i heard hillary i heard bill i heard kerry and gore and of course barack
9142054 and i dont have any qualms about voting for barack
9142055 it will be very difficult to guess where the electorate is going with this
9142056 social science doesnt tell us what happens when a socially conservative woman runs nationally
9142057 elale olarak bilinen havai fi e in patlamas sonucu 13 hem erimiz yaraland hastanemizin yo un al mas sonucunda bir ocuk ve milletvekilimiz hari taburcu edildi bir ocuk ise tokata sevk edildi hayati tehlikesi olup olmad hen z net de il konserimiz iptal edilmi tir milletvekilimiz dilek y ksel han m ise kula nda doku kayb olmu ve ameliyata al nm t r t m hem erilerimize ge mi olsun diyorum
9142058 theres some indications at the early on stage of the investigation that it was an intentional act
9142059 were going to treat it as a homicide until otherwise proven
9142060 after speaking with witnesses and examining the scene there was just some thought that it may have been intentional so therefore we wanted to get in on the ground floor and take care of the issue before it got away on us
9142061 the car was just essentially careening through the front window
9142062 it was travelling at a pretty substantial rate of speed apparently and it did not appear as though it slowed
9142063 theres hardly anything left it literally looks like a bomb exploded inside its just completely ripped apart
9142064 did this occur because of a mechanical problem did this occur because of a medical problem is drugs or alcohol involved or did he set out to do this is it a case of murder and a failed suicide attempt we just dont know that yet
9142065 what i see in terms of addictions is people have a lack of connection to themselves and working with the horses can be a really good way for them to become clearer and more focused
9142066 just being with the horses getting the patients out of their environments in the downtown eastside and having them in a place thats different
9142067 because theyre herd animals they really do need to sense their environment in a very very clear way because there could be a predator lurking in the distance or in close proximity
9142068 theyre very very attuned to peoples emotions and theyre very very reactive to people and the more sort of in tune or centred that you can be the calmer the horse will be or the more connected the horse will be with you
9142069 people might say that horse is off by itself it must feel lonely and isolated
9142070 its the persons experience being projected out there it gives us a lot of information about whats going on for that person and it gives them a place to start in terms of connecting with the horse as well

9142075 the carbon based interests oil and coal have a 50 year lease on the republican party and theyre drilling it for everything its worth
9142076 some of the best marketers have the worst products and this is certainly true of todays republican party
9142077 sportsmen have been stereotyped as concerned with one issue guns but if you listen to sportsmen as i have over the years we hear a different story
9142078 democrats are all about conservation they are all about preservation i think thats a huge opportunity
9142079 with sen obama you have a lifetime record of supporting gun control voting for gun control speaking out against gun rights and voting against gun rights either as an elected official or a private citizen
9142080 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama
9142081 that makes two of us actually that makes 18 million of us because like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
9142082 the most powerful country in the world to the weakest
9142083 why do they dislike intelligence in this country in leaders
9142084 i knew abe abe was a friend of mine and baracks no lincoln
9142085 senator i knew abe lincoln abe lincoln was friend of mine senator youre no abe lincoln
9142086 living next to you is in some ways like sleeping with an elephant no matter how friendly and even tempered the beast one is affected by every twitch and grunt
9142087 take it from me if it had ended differently we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis we would be fighting for middle income families we would not be showing contempt for the constitution wed be protecting the rights of every american regardless of race religion disability gender or sexual orientation
9142088 yes of course you are now we got to buckle down and save planet express
9142089 curiosity is the very basis of education and if you tell me that curiosity killed the cat i say only that the cat died nobly
9142090 everyone will know that when you come here it is public service
9142091 john mccain just does not get what ordinary people here in beaver pennsylvania are going through
9142092 we think that pennsylvanias demographics fit mccains candidacy much better than they fit obamas
9142093 he seemed to come out of nowhere one day hes nobody the next hes on oprah
9142094 the state of our economy is so awful and the republicans got us here
9142095 its about time for a change sooner or later its going to happen
9142096 i like that she is pro life and like me she has a child with disabilities
9142097 but she is so young and she doesnt have much experience
9142098 the cab was on one side of the train and the tanker on the other
9142099 this court is representing itself falsely as a court of the international community whereas it is in fact a court of nato whose aim is to liquidate me
9142100 i have stopped using a false name so i think all parties should do the same
9142101 i will not plead in line with my standpoint as regards this court
9142102 an old story by one of the worst mass murderers in the world
9142103 i think being a vice president has more to do with how you can communicate with people
9142104 being from a small community you have to reach across the aisles and work with people of opposing parties who happen to shop in your same grocery store
9142105 yes because im smart enough to surround myself with good people in their field and im comfortable making decisions i do it all the time
9142106 the tone of the meeting was positive and constructive and i remain willing to facilitate further progress towards a solution
9142107 im not trying to prove anything here i consider this adapting to the environment
9142108 if i was still on level ground like i was before in the other storms i know i would be dreading gustav
9142109 there still tends to be more value put on the things we would like to show our neighbors
9142110 gov palin has more executive experience than sen obama sen biden and sen schumer combined because those guys have never run anything
9142111 when you look at a candidate you should ask two questions what have you done and what have you run
9142112 this storm has the potential for being a very dangerous storm
9142113 there was a girl who let me borrow her hoop and i havent put it down since
9142114 guru lebih baik mana orang yang mengejar akhirat dengan orang yang mengejar dunia

9142117 nak andi akan berbeda manfaat antara harta yang digenggam orang bijak dengan harta yang digenggam orang dungu
9142118 ive been so focused on state government i havent been focused much on the war in iraq
9142119 i need something new something clear something to steal the spotlight away from obamas speech
9142120 i think whats going to raise the comfort level of coal miners is that barack obama is from a coal producing state
9142121 he has worked with the illinois legislature on coal issues we feel comfortable with that and the fact that john mccain is proposing 13 new nuclear plants doesnt do us any good at all i think barack obama will appropriate money for clean coal research and technology and carbon capture and sequestration which is what were going to have to do we have to face the reality of the climate change issue and we are becoming a greener society but we need to be a part of that i dont think coal is going to go away for a long long way
9142122 they take it for granted they think maybe electricity is just something that comes out of the wall
9142123 were making sure they see the shoddy record that sen mccain has when it comes to veterans when it comes to labor unions and when it comes to working class folks
9142124 we dont tell our members how to vote well tell them it starts from the ground up who we think would be the best candidate for the membership its our job to put the information in their hands i think theyll make the right decision
9142125 we would really like to see some blue at the end of the tunnel this year
9142126 theres nothing out there man you go take a picture of nothing
9142127 when people rightly complain about higher gasoline prices we propose to give more money to the oil companies and pretend that theyre going to bring prices down
9142128 i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
9142129 the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
9142130 once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches this transition
9142131 the question simply put is will we seize the opportunity for a change
9142132 why is the election so close its close today because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change that barack obama represents
9142133 and then let us leave here tonight and take that message of hope from denver
9142134 and do everything we can to serve our nation our world and our children and their future by electing barack obama president of the united states of america
9142135 the republicans cant seem to get a break when it comes to august and when it comes to the weather
9142136 involved engaged and getting briefings and working to make sure that the federal assistance is there
9142137 now is the time to prepare yourself your family and your friends
9142138 one of the most important lessons we learned after hurricane katrina was that there is no substitute for awareness and self help especially in the days before a hurricane is predicted to hit
9142139 with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
9142140 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
9142141 i will restore our moral standing so that america is once again the last best hope for those who are called to the cause of peace
9142142 i get it i realise that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office
9142143 i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
9142144 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me
9142145 on november 4 we must stand up and say eight years is enough
9142146 let there be no doubt the republican nominee john mccain has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect
9142147 im not ready to take a 10 per cent chance on change
9142148 i dont believe senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
9142149 why else would he define middle class as someone making under us5 million a year
9142150 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
9142151 hes now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them
9142152 the same policies those policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
9142153 look bro we are reaching if not already reached peak oil peak coal and peak natural gas
9142154 over time wall street firms began to trade against their clients for their own account such that now the direct investment activities of a firm like goldman sachs dwarf their activities on behalf of outside customers
9142155 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
9142156 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
9142157 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
9142158 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
9142159 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
9142160 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
9142161 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
9142162 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
9142163 spicejet has curtailed its capacity increase foreseeing asubsequent impact of decline in passengers for the currentyear

9142170 this storm has the potential for being a very dangerous storm
9142171 at the moment there is not enough of a political process for a peacekeeping operation to be really successful
9142172 the fundamental error is to think of un forces as if they were the world police
9142173 i think very often now theres an overemphasis on what force can achieve

9142190 you know that youre going to be watched by more people than have seen you before that time
9142191 we tried to celebrate the notion that it would be a more open inclusive caring government

9142200 weve had thousands die in the first few years and mccain wants to keep it up for 100 more years
9142201 mccain and keating had become personal friends following their initial contacts in 1981 between 1982 and 1987 mccain had received 112 000 in political contributions from keating and his associates
9142202 so long as they are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed
9142203 in some voters it will continue to be an issue
9142204 and it has been ever since barry goldwater ran against lyndon johnson in 1964 and thats the reason that the republican party has been so successful in the south
9142205 if barack loses by that amount theyll say its racism
9142206 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
9142207 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
9142208 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
9142209 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
9142210 if we could win arizona this year it would set such a milestone for the democratic party we would bury the republicans for 25 years
9142211 but ive been here before folks if anyone can screw this up its the democratic party

9142223 why dont these bloody people just knock their nonsense off
9142224 as perplexed as people whod togged up for a fancy dress party and gone to the wrong address
9142225 at their age i was disdaining the opportunity of a free university education in favour of loafing and trying to scratch a living as a rock journalist theyd voyaged halfway around the world to fix a busted country
9142226 the soldiers swept their rifles back and forth up and down then gathered in a corner
9142227 this is ridiculous observed rana correctly we stopped so did the soldiers i told the one who seemed to be in charge that he was spoiling our walk youre spoiling our patrol he grinned

9142238 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
9142239 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
9142240 and in the race to stop global warming hes a friend of our planet too
9142241 john kerrys been fighting for thirty five years to protect our environment
9142242 basically a true story but it just hasnt happened yet
9142243 a thrilling spectacle but ultimately distances the public from the problem
9142244 we were interested in blurring the lines between fact and fiction
9142245 its very important that the program is clearly labelled a drama and not a documentary
9142246 even though the chances of climate change are significant there are processes in place to manage the consequences
9142247 the bottom line is our cities are not going to run out of water
9142248 this movie is to climate science as frankenstein is to heart transplant surgery
9142249 the power of population is so superior to the power of the earth to produce subsistence for man that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race
9142250 a terrifying glimpse of the none too distant future when climate change will force the worlds powers into a desperate struggle for advantage and even survival
9142251 there is a probability of wars including even nuclear wars if temperatures rise 2 to 3 degrees celsius
9142252 my background is 30 years in the strategic field and i look at this stuff and the potential for huge disruption to internal relationships and international relationships to me looks enormous
9142253 there is a range of possibilities here thats why these scenarios are not mutually independent each one is a free floating possibility and they depend on the amount of change that you have got but that basically is a question of dates
9142254 i dont imagine people reading this book will be empowered or disempowered to the extent that it will make a whole lot of difference to the balance of outcomes
9142255 im not a pessimist i dont think these are foregone conclusions we are on a large highway and there are any number of exits off this highway that we could take and avoid the bridge thats out down the road
9142256 but there are no guarantees that any of them will be taken and further down the highway very bad things will happen if the exits arent taken

9142264 i really like you so much and have a lot of respect for you but i would like to marry you and i have a question which side of the bed do you prefer to sleep on
9142265 you are very cute but you know my boyfriend will kill you
9142266 steve logan is a very special person in my life
9142267 he is really the reason i am in college football he gave me my first real break in this profession and all ive learned about offensive football i learned from steve he is a real mentor for me
9142268 he tried everything he could to screw that up and i just wouldnt let him
9142269 i encouraged him to take the leap ask him hell admit it
9142270 obviously we need to win they need to win and you dont want your friends to lose you enjoy seeing them but at the same time somebody is going to win and somebody is going to lose this game we both understand that
9142271 im excited about this football team but i dont know what they are yet as a team we are about to find out
9142272 if you are going to play boston college this is the time to play them
9142273 because i promise you three games down the road that quarterback is going to be light years better than he will be going into this game i just know steve logan he gets three games under his belt with this young man crane will be good in this game but hell be lights out three games from now
9142274 the volunteers are a little nervous about how large this one is going to be

9142280 the discovery of relics of ancient villages nobles tombs with exquisite jade burial artifacts imperial graveyards sacrificial altars and large scale mountain structures in liangzhu town marks essential evidence of chinas 5 000 years of history

9142282 other studies have suggested that there are differences between men and women in response to different antidepressants but the evidence has been conflicting
9142283 this study is large enough and we were able to control for enough complicating factors that we feel confident there is a true difference these results have clear implications for the clinical treatment of depression
9142284 it was good but my start was not too good

9142305 i invest heavily in areas that look promising but also proportionately balance my risk by putting some money in standard investments such as stocks bonds and money market funds
9142306 my top tip is making baby steps before giant leaps
9142307 by starting slowly your risk factor is greatly diminished and financial commitment is much lower you can get out at any time with minimal losses or move forward into more risky e gaming photographic images areas with good fundamental knowledge
9142308 we want all of this to be simple and risk to be nominal the main area in which people have difficutly is assessing their wealth and risk factors far too often we see e gaming photographic images investors jumping into a portfolio that is far too aggressive the end result can be disasterous invoking many to file bankruptcy
9142309 give yourself a nice cussion of cash and retirement income
9142310 personally i save about 10 each month for retirement 20 as liquid cash for everyday needs and another 40 for investing this may sound very demanding especially with regard to e gaming photographic images investments but in actuality it is really a reflection of what you want for your future not necessarily what you want now
9142311 the motivation to have money from a e gaming photographic images portfolio in the future is great
9142312 but dont forget that you cant live in the future forever many people fall into the trap of not meeting basic needs in the present which logically means that their future will become progressively more difficult
9142313 make e gaming photographic images investments work for you and retire wealthy
9142314 were looking at the long term here quick wins are for lotteries and penny poker games not the e gaming photographic images investment market i think given enough time those who invest in this area will see good returns for their e gaming photographic images money
9142315 one has to balance artistic talent with the rigors of usable multimedia
9142316 and as a result we tend to only hire those who are from accredited design universitys such as risd
9142317 we love using intense flash graphics for our weekly work
9142318 because of the nature of global telecommunications we are playing with a tremendous home field advantage and we need to exploit that edge
9142319 we also need to protect that edge and we need to protect those who provide it to us
9142320 since passage of the patriot act many companies based outside of the united states have been reluctant to store client information in the u s
9142321 there is an ongoing concern that u s intelligence agencies will gather this information without legal process there is particular sensitivity about access to financial information as well as communications and internet traffic that goes through u s switches
9142322 its no different than any other infrastructure that a country needs
9142323 are on a rampage to build out across india and china so they have alternative routes and so they dont have to route through the u s
9142324 we discovered the internet but we couldn t keep it a secret
9142325 people dont have a lot of exposure to the army
9142326 saw heard learned and deliberated the overwhelming condition of the state
9142327 provide iowans with all of the assistance support and resources possible for a wise and strong recovery
9142328 very concrete list of what needs to be done to get from today to april
9142329 to get iowans back in their homes and iowa businesses up and running again
9142330 while the rest of the state moves forward in planning for other priorities we need help
9142331 we are self reliant and diligent workers but we cannot do this alone
9142332 the jet stream steers weather systems across the atlantic and normally it would go up between iceland and scotland bringing low pressure in that area
9142333 we would normally get high pressure from the azores but that has not really happened this year
9142334 this year the jet stream has been further south bringing low pressure and rain to wales
9142335 we use llanarth village hall in monmouthshire theres a football pitch there we use as a launch site but the ground is too soft for land rovers
9142336 we would have done 30 or 40 flights in august usually and weve done four its been that bad
9142337 pas de soucis on va juste en hongrie et ensuite en bulgarie et de toutes fa ons apr s on change de bagnole nouveau
9142338 there are racers who throw in the towel pretty quick without broken arms with just a head cold
9142339 we had a bad fishing year that year so we didnt have any money
9142340 so we decided to spend 35 bucks and go down to the courthouse
9142341 we didnt know what they were going to do on offense and defense it was different from their approach last year it was the first time since ive been here that we produced in all three phases
9142342 it was a slant where you take two steps and run to the pylon
9142343 it was just a matter of faking out the defense it just came open
9142344 getting the ball down deep in armys territory from there its simple
9142345 the defense put us in a good position bruce made a good play and maneri ran a good route
9142346 i was just doing my job and doing what the coaches told me to do
9142347 we work on scoop and score every day its second nature
9142348 an outstanding choice that should be extremely reassuring to the conservative base
9142349 gives us confidence he will keep his pledges to voters regarding the kinds of justices he would nominate to the supreme court
9142350 a woman of faith who has a strong position on life a consistent opinion on judges shes the complete package
9142351 the question is how this will be received by a lot of rank and file evangelicals who are just americans struggling along going to their megachurches and care about values
9142352 mccain is saying to social and religious conservatives im taking your views incredibly seriously
9142353 people lead such sedentary lives already that the last thing they want to do when they get to the gym is sit in a machine and work one muscle at a time
9142354 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
9142355 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
9142356 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
9142357 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
9142358 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
9142359 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
9142360 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
9142361 he got off to such a great start i feel bad for him
9142362 he was a very steady guy but this happens unfortunately
9142363 i think he is reliable he made pretty good decisions in the kicking game he runs hard he does all the things weve said but he is a part of that group at running back that we are going to have to take a look at
9142364 ben is one of the leaders of the receivers he has helped us all i dont look at it like his injury helps me i look at it like we need to get those injured players back
9142365 it is presumptuous in my view to suggest that we know where we need to be in 2050
9142366 this wont solve our energy problem by itself so there is no point in doing this
9142367 weve got plenty of oil to get us through the short term while we move to electricity
9142368 some chapters begin with a quotation please dont assume that my quoting someone means that i agree with them think of these quotes as provocations as hypotheses to be critically assessed
9142369 i have a major problem sending so much money overseas in order to purchase oil from folks who dont like us
9142370 rather than speeding up the use of our own oil why not put our emphasis on lowering our overall use
9142371 were going to have to get off petroleum sooner or later
9142372 just take an objective look at the continuous string of incidents at existing nuclear facilities and you will have to admit that what works great on paper falls a bit short in the real world leaks fires spills sleeping security squads
9142373 solar and wind along with possible tidal and geothermal will do the job
9142374 this is seriously insulting to american women and not helping your case
9142375 we remain resolved that we want to pursue thistransaction but obviously it would have to be without the newrules
9142376 i dont think its fair for anyone to blame it on maybankor bank negara the core issue is the new rule was introduced and applied on a transaction that was launched inmarch
9142377 un problema pol tico de fondo sin resolver en este pa s
9142378 ese problema sigue siendo real un problema que no se ha resuelto y yo considero personalmente que s lo se resolver a trav s del di logo y la negociaci n
9142379 un escenario de paz y democracia que le permita decidir su futuro y al mismo tiempo dentro de ese proceso se libere a todos los presos pol ticos vascos
9142380 todos los compa eros que se han quedado en la prisi n en martutene y en otras c rceles
9142381 los centenares de familiares que hoy ayer y ma ana se desplazar n miles de kil metros para ver a los suyos en las prisiones
9142382 the nature of our operations doesnt require that we carry both
9142383 transport canada was satisfied that we met the regulation and they approved the change
9142384 a lot of these airlines say well our passengers are our main concern thats a bit of a misnomer
9142385 it was extra above and beyond what was required under the canadian aviation regulations
9142386 if you are an airline and you fly an airplane over a body of water you have to have a or an approved floatation means
9142387 when you want to quit you need to quit now
9142388 if youre told you have to wait three or four days that drive to quit it just goes down and addiction takes over
9142389 i still for the life of me cannot believe i was able to stay clean
9142390 theres a patchwork which leaves a lot of people without support
9142391 the wind in the trees rustled like the moccasins of the voyageurs making the portage
9142392 at the end of this quiet residential street i found what had once been the epicentre of north americas richest business
9142393 it was near where i stood in the predawn gloom that at 5 a m on may 28 1808
9142394 on the same day of the same month after studying frasers reports of tides and distances travelled to work out my best guess as to the time of day hed actually sighted the sea
9142395 over a spindly latticework it resembled the shrouds of a sailing ship he fraser wrote of native indian ladders and suspension bridges made with poles lashed together they dangled above the torrent from ropes woven out of rawhide and vegetable fibre
9142396 the pestilence depopulated vast swathes of the western landscape leaving the demoralized tatters of once great tribes to negotiate future treaties this created a still prevailing misconception among those who came later to claim their land that it had always been unoccupied and under used by its aboriginal inhabitants
9142397 i looked into the cold dark current and thought then how it resembled frasers life so much was obscured in the sweep of time and forgetfulness when you look you see only reflections of yourself looking back
9142398 our goal was to come out smoking and thats exactly what we did
9142399 we wanted to play power football and if it worked we wanted to keep doing it were really proud of these kids they really did a great job
9142400 we hurt ourselves in the first half a little bit with the fumbles
9142401 thats part of the anxiety of the first game of the season and theyre just kids but we didnt want to continue that trend in the second half
9142402 we wanted to control the clock and drive it down the field matt mithaugen and ike carlson really ran hard tonight and nick risbrudt made a couple of nice catches to keep that drive going
9142403 im a little sore and a little tired right now
9142404 but its worth every bit of it to start the year by beating moorhead like this
9142405 nothing i or any of the other backs gained on the ground was on us
9142406 the credit has to go to our line they did amazing tonight you could drive a truck through the holes they opened
9142407 hes just such a leader for us and works hard in the weight room and just really sets a good example for all his teammates hes always positive always encouraging for him to get that touchdown maybe hell want to play defense for the gophers now
9142408 understand this is a transition and parents need to really be alert to kids and notice how theyre reacting
9142409 the focus of our team the mentality of our team
9142410 everybody came on day one in training camp ready to go physically mentally and emotionally
9142411 guys are ready to get that 2007 season behind them and move forward
9142412 i think we had a good training camp like i said we had just really one major casualty osi umenyiora as far as injuries and missing a guy for the season for the most part everybody physically came out safe everybody has been attentive
9142413 we kind of left off with what we did on defense as far as running the schemes understanding the schemes and even being able to add a little bit more to our packages i think from a mental standpoint guys are even more focused than they were last year and ready to get off to a fast start
9142414 we have a good group of players and there is good focus
9142415 you look at the strength of our team having had the experience of playing down through the playoffs so you are optimistic about that
9142416 i think we have a team that still feels we have something to prove
9142417 we are just not satisfied with where we are as a team it is a matter of knowing that we have to become a better team and i think that has been our focus when you look at the whole last season the regular season especially you just see so many areas that we can improve on and we were playing football that wasnt our best and we knew we were capable of playing better we just have to work hard on that and just be consistent week in and week out i think that has been our motivation and we know we have to do that
9142418 we have a lot of young guys that have stepped up and made a lot of competition battles at several positions linebacker running back and receiver
9142419 i think that is good for your team it builds character it builds quality
9142420 it isnt something that you wait until the final hour it is ongoing it is the establishment of opinions it is the ranks that occur after every game it is how it all fits together in terms of special teams
9142421 it is always a time of a certain amount of anxiety no matter what because you cant get away from the fact that the mixture is really critical also you have to be aware of how these people are going to fit together and play roles on special teams
9142422 we have to make decisions on first of all what is the status of lawrence tynes and i think that is ongoing fortunately we have a day here when we can continue that progress

9142425 i will buy a jamba juice for every online bee reader if bobby jackson plays in more than 50 games this season
9142426 its tough trying to get our actuarys to analyze flash programming for gaming online business risk
9142427 we cannot solve the problems between the dup and sinn fein at the level of total political immaturity they are currently at
9142428 no matter how much our message is ignored or ridiculed as was done in the campaign no matter how much they did to us it only energized our grass roots
9142429 our focus is really on this side of the river
9142430 we think theres enough excitement and energy on this side
9142431 we only want to cause noise in the sense of letting people know there are other movements out there that other people believe in
9142432 i feel as one person who stands up i have a voice and letting it be heard sends fear to the establishment
9142433 es gibt eine definierte spielregel wenn uns daimler f r nix die neuesten autos hinstellt und wir die fahren d rfen haben wir logischerweise einen gr eren fuhrpark das spart kosten
9142434 holy shit there isnt a black person in iowa this guy has transcended
9142435 police believe that this has not been a random attack but an incident involving two groups of males who are known to each other
9142436 this storm has the potential for being a very dangerous storm
9142437 this coming 12 months will be the most difficult 12 months the labour party has had in a generation quite frankly
9142438 weve got to rediscover that zeal which won three elections and that is a huge problem for us at the moment we really have to make our minds up are we ready to try and persuade this country to support us for another term because the next 12 months are critical its still there to play for
9142439 who is telling the truth at the top of government
9142440 the prime minister says the economic situation isnt as bad people think and that britain is well placed to weather the economic storm but the chancellor says we are at a 60 year low
9142441 gordon brown has briefed out stories that he has an economic recovery plan all worked out meanwhile the chancellor says the downturn will be more profound and long lasting than people thought
9142442 its not clear whether alistair darling meant to tell us the truth about the mess 10 years of a labour government has left our economy in but he has certainly let the cat out of the bag
9142443 the government is finally being honest with itself and with the british public about the scale of the problem and recognises that the british economy is not simply a victim of external events
9142444 the next step must now be for the government to admit that those aspects of the economy which it believed were its sources of strengths are now clearly its weaknesses
9142445 suppose i never ever met you suppose we never fell in love suppose i never ever let you kiss me so sweet and so soft

9142448 there is nothing which is best literally for the whole people
9142449 lift the stone and drop it on ones own foot
9142450 whoever you vote for a politician always gets in vote informal
9142451 stabbing a woman was like cutting a loaf of bread
9142452 ivan can cut your head off with one blow ive seen him do it
9142453 the relative cant stab anyone he has to shoot them
9142454 he said you better put me in a safe cell which means he was going to attempt to harm himself
9142455 some of it is to get sympathy but its a fine line sometimes between an attempt and a successful suicide
9142456 there is no suggestion in this case that the offender or offenders was or were other than caucasian
9142457 when working alone in the open a medium sized backpacker can be withstrained easily by using a clove hitch around the neck runnning the rope alongside the flank and forming a double loop tie off under the left foot the backpacker can then be brought to the ground for subsequet satanic rituals by pulling on the rope at a 45 degree angle
9142458 no matter how much our message is ignored or ridiculed as was done in the campaign no matter how much they did to us it only energized our grass roots
9142459 our focus is really on this side of the river
9142460 we think theres enough excitement and energy on this side
9142461 we only want to cause noise in the sense of letting people know there are other movements out there that other people believe in
9142462 the ones ive talked to are pretty hardcore about sticking around but some have realized that if they stay if we were to get another storm it could make emergency services and day to day safety hazardous
9142463 i went to a third set the other match in my second round so i didnt want to do that
9142464 i was a little bit frustrated with myself in the first set i was serving well and holding my serves and doing quite well then in the second set i dont know what happened i just lost my rhythm throughout the whole match i had a really bad percentage of first serves and mainly playing with second serves which obviously doesnt help
9142465 im sure the match against li will be a tough one
9142466 and it will be tough for both of us because weve played against each other a year ago and it was really very close match
9142467 i know south africans really well they dont want to lose
9142468 they would have wanted to have beaten us at trent bridge and again theyre very very proud people very stubborn people
9142469 its the pressure that were putting on their batters bowling at 90mph and then our batters are hitting their good deliveries for four and really commanding respect
9142470 ive thought about it weve talked about it and if we keep performing like we are there is no reason why we cant win 5 0
9142471 it puts extra pressure on us because it takes us up to second but thats the kind of pressure i want
9142472 if capello is going to let owen and rooney grow into the partnership i believe they can become then areas of the pitch have to become no go areas for rooney
9142473 the biggest accusation being thrown at rooney at the moment is that he is constantly playing out of position
9142474 thats just about everything you can be on a football pitch except being the one thing we all want him to be an out and out striker
9142475 okay i agree they havent exactly set the world alight yet

9142486 there is a garifuna man in this village you should talk in your language and see how he reacts
9142487 i told him yes my uncle i am garifuna just like you
9142488 he embraced me and would not let go he could not believe a man so young could speak garifuna having imagined the language would perish with him
9142489 from that day i realized that what was happening in nicaragua the disappearance of garifuna culture foreshadowed what was going to happen in belize less than a generation down the road
9142490 i decided to follow my passion and focus more on performing garifuna music as a way to keep the traditions alive long into the future
9142491 under the direction of my producer ivan duran i made a 180 degree turn
9142492 and i am so happy now to take a completely human experience onto the stage as opposed to where i saw myself heading in the mid 90s with samplers sequencers and instrumental backing tracks i look back and i cringe i dont feel a need to be devoid of technology i do not want to become a slave to it
9142493 were not doing the strictly danceable material of punta rock where the lyrics are basically shake up your waist and dance the fascinating thing you will notice about the styles we are doing is that the beauty is in the simplicity garifuna songs may only have two lines and if you transcribe them you still do not get the full meaning but a good garifuna song is like a photograph it captures a moment in time a split second of someones life
9142494 garifuna music in recent times has been popular for punta and parranda dance oriented music forms for carnival or the dance floor
9142495 but on this album were bringing attention to songs that arent like that
9142496 day by day uses a rhythm extracted from ritual music called d g a traditional healing ceremony that unites family members from all over central america it is a prayer asking gods blessings for our people and asking for guidance strength and healing in an afflicted world
9142497 who will speak to me in garifuna in times to come who will perform the d g who will perform the arumahani song in times to come we must preserve garifuna culture now lest we lose it altogether in times to come
9142498 baba has become like an anthem performed in every garifuna church
9142499 it talks about fate baba has many meanings father father as god and it also could be an ancestor from your family who has died ancestors play an important role in garifuna culture
9142500 the collective is the culmination of years of defining what i think is the more emotional part of garifuna music
9142501 i started cumbancha precisely so i could help bring wider exposure to exceptional artists and projects like andy palacio and the garifuna collective
9142502 ive been fascinated with garifuna music and culture since i was a budding ethnomusicologist doing field work in central america in 1989 and 90
9142503 i even got to play conch shell on one of the songs
9142504 i am really very proud of how we recorded the album
9142505 we spent a few months in a cabin right by the sea in a small village working with all the musicians developing the arrangements from scratch this music does not exist in its natural form you cant go to a club and listen to this what exists is a very raw form you might hear some of the rhythms at a beluria a kind of wake and you hear people singing with a lot of emotion but not necessarily in tune everyday people keep this culture alive they are like you and me just in the community making music everyday so we wanted to capture that spirit while paying close attention to high quality production values and the essence of garifuna songs and music we took the time to make sure each musician that came in understood each song
9142506 i never want the listener to hear the production work just to appreciate the music for what it is a garifuna song is very basic short simple lyrics and one rhythm very rarely will it have a bridge like a pop song a typical formula would be to put in a bridge to expand it an outside producer would say lets add a guitar or a saxophone solo and most likely that would be a studio musician with no connection we used a great lead guitarist from honduras who is always working with garifuna musicians but i still made sure he spent time with us on the songs as opposed to sending him digital files
9142507 knowing this music inside out that is what i feel most proud of
9142508 this is what i know best and is exactly what i wanted to do all along

9142528 however behavior such as the intentional obstruction of a contracted photo enforcement vans operation is not lawful and subject to enforcement action
9142529 the person who was arrested was not a demonstrator but rather a journalist who was videographing the event for local media site freedomsphoenix com

9142557 the afps announcement highlights yet again the inadequacy of the current haneef inquiry which is not a full blown properly constituted royal commission australian council for civil liberties president terry ogorman told aap
9142558 theres been a lingering suspicion which has firmed up that the afp in maintaining the investigation against dr haneef for the last 12 months has really been engaged in a smoke screen back protection exercise and theres been no reason for dr haneef to be kept under investigation he said
9142559 what the inquiry should look at is how much money what resources has the afp used in the last 12 months and has there been a legitimate line of inquiry it has been following or has it simply been parroting that line as a back protection exercise
9142560 quite inexplicably the rudd election campaign promised to set up an inquiry it turned out to be a mickey mouse inquiry because its not conducted under the provisions of the federal royal commissions act
9142561 it is not a royal commission it is not sitting in public it cant force the afp among other agencies to produce witnesses or produce documents it can only ask them to
9142562 do not use the information in any way nor act in reliance on it

9142571 its not easy but we made a commitment just as you did today and although its not easy this is all part of loving someone with all your heart and with all you have to give its a promise that should last a lifetime it defines you as a person and describes your soul its a promise to be there one for the other no matter what happens no matter who falls

9142625 il ministro gelmini prima stritola la scuola poi le mette il grembiule e con il bullismo se la cava a buon mercato dopo aver tagliato i docenti ora li deprime nelle loro motivazioni e poi con il 5 in condotta pensa di avere tranquillizzato le famiglie
9142626 non credibile un governo che sostiene di voler investire sulla scuola dopo che lha smantellata nelle sue fondamenta trasformare le scuole in fondazioni e privatizzare il diritto allistruzione aggiunge soliani significa favorire i pi ricchi abbandonare gli istituti italiani in balia delle logiche di mercato oltretutto dopo averne chiuso i presidi pi periferici in montagna e nei piccoli comuni
9142627 la scuola e il suo fondamentale contributo per la costruzione di una societ democratica sono gi messi a dura prova dagli enormi tagli operati dalla finanziaria ovvio che ora il ministro proponga il maestro unico vista la considerevole riduzione del personale docente messa in atto con lunico scopo di fare cassa per recuperare i fondi necessari al federalismo fiscale che servir ad accontentare la lega deve accontentare la lega per stanziare i 50 miliardi di euro dellexpo 2015 che in gran parte finiranno nelle tasche dei grandi imprenditori alcuni dei quali oggi chiamati ad assumere responsabilit in alitalia ecco con quali interessi ha oggi a che fare la scuola italiana conclude la senatrice del pd ecco con chi se la dovranno vedere i nostri docenti tremonti e bossi che hanno bisogno di soldi e perci colpiscono i pi deboli che temono la libert dei docenti e quella cultura critica che proprio la scuola contribuisce a far crescere nel nostro paese

9142693 this huge leap in energy needs entails not only the construction of more substations but also a tremendous increase in emissions and in the national carbon footprint even with no smartcity malta is far from reaching set targets with smart city malta will almost inevitably be liable to legal procedures and fines of unprecedented and frightening consequence
9142694 we are informed that article 5 of the eu energy performance of buildings directive demands that the developer carries out an economic environmental and technical study on the use of combined heat amp power chp renewable energy central heating and cooling etc for such developments as smart city but article 5 has not been transposed into maltese legislation with the result that malta is facing serious infringement procedures

9143132 es fant stico seguir las trazadas de otro piloto como hirvonen eso te facilita mucho las cosas ya que ves desde lejos las zonas en las que ha cortado y si no lo ves parado a la salida quiere decir que puedes cortar tu tambi n
9143133 no era mi intenci n usar ninguna t ctica pero visto que el reglamento es as lo he usado ya que es tonto regalar una victoria cuando se ve que este sistema perjudica notablemente a quien abre la carretera

9143145 i have no idea how she played what the other girl did i have no idea i only heard it on the news
9143146 there was no indication on the putting green warming up that was going to tell me it was going to be like that
9143147 it was just one of those days where i made about a 15 footer on the first hole and another on the second hole and then i had about eight feet on the third hole and it looked easy after the first two

9143300 the point is to change with time and upgrade the theatres with all amenities you cannot let your cinema hall rot most of the single screens have closed down because the owners were not ready to accept change and invest money such owners have taken the audience for granted
9143301 multiplexes only offer good comfort and technology but single screen theatres still cater to a larger audience because of their variety of tickets but i agree that viewers will come to theatres only if it is well maintained
9143302 old single screen owners are not upgrading their halls because they are not devoted to the business they might be still standing but are not faring well owners will earn profit only if they upgrade
9143303 single screen theatres have not become totally redundant they are still required by filmmakers because there is still a lot of single screen niche audience multiplexes serve only the high class audience
9143304 a large number of migrants from bihar prefer watching bhojpuri films four years back i gave it a shot and it was a huge success since then im showing only bhojpuri films
9143305 it takes a minimum rs 20 million to rs 50 million rs 2 5 crore to upgrade a single screen theatre but this investment is very low compared to constructing new properties so the old cinema halls still have an opportunity to upgrade and be on a par with multiplexes with high returns
9143306 to win an award here really means something i happily dedicate this achievement to my wife and family who have put up with my work schedule for the past years
9143307 i was completely flabberghasted i planned to attend the annual gaming in indonesia award night for fun and the after parties but lo and behold i walked home with an award for best new analysis and statistical measurement in a gaming in indonesia project
9143308 it is always very good to showcase local talent during important events so that others outside of our gaming in indonesia industry can benefit from this special night
9143309 the fact that the selection process for recognition int he gaming in indonesia industry is so complicated demonstrates a lot forethough and consideration for fairness
9143310 and this goes hand in hand with the level of quality we as a gaming in indonesia industry demonstrate to the general public
9143311 i know the academy of gaming in indonesia design and production respects my work and im confident that i will win an award one of these days
9143312 the event which covered most all aspects of gaming in indonesia will donate 10 of all proceeds to local charities in need of funding and support according to vertie luhr the night organizer
9143313 i have so much to do cant you do it faster

9143319 plan ahead and map out a safe and smooth evacuation route and please follow any evacuation orders
9143320 things can be replaced nothing is worth putting yourself or your family in harms way
9143321 it is also a good idea to have emergency supplies such as flashlights radio batteries and water on hand if you live in a hurricane prone area
9143322 we recommend installing storm shutters to protect your windows or nailing plywood panels to your window frames when a storm approaches
9143323 it is also a good idea to cover your sliding doors with plywood and to replace old garage doors and tracks with a door that is approved for both wind pressure and impact protection
9143324 if wind comes into your home through a large opening it increases your chances of major damage to the rest of your home especially your roof
9143325 the coalition partners have the impression that the situation is deteriorating and we are thinking of telling the prime minister to decide on the future of the government
9143326 they want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out and do the coup again
9143327 it takes us away from painful memories to the happier part of lauras life
9143328 you can get stuck remembering people the way they were the last time you saw them
9143329 i think she saw arts as a way to bring some peace and relief to kids like her in their adolescent years
9143330 this is our way to help continue some of the work that she would have done had she been able to whether it was helping a young person to paint or promote ways to conserve water
9143331 we were pleased to receive as many applications as we did and its taking us a bit longer than wed expected to go through them
9143332 the people on the committee are businesspeople who have the ability and drive to raise substantial funds
9143333 its a much clearer report in terms of its content and the way its presented thats something we didnt have previously
9143334 what was he thinking this palin guy will be only a heartbeat away from the presidency should anything happen to mccain and at his age with that skin cancer he could drop any minute god forbid of course
9143335 and i say that with all due respect to quayle i knew dan quayle and bob palin is no dan quayle
9143336 this palin guy is a two term small town mayor whos been governor for only two years his foreign policy experience is limited to living close to russia domestically he killed a bridge project and got rid of some corruption but you know those alaskans twenty words for snow fifty for corruption and hes got five kids so that should keep him out of the west wing and out of trouble perfect right if they can knock off obama and biden then w can retire to the ranch and cheney can continue to run things from an undisclosed location you know this telecommuting is a great thing

9143342 there s a guy on my job now who is shacking up with his fiancee he doesnt seem to be as enthusiastic as he was when they werent living together i wonder how that s going to turn out
9143343 she and her man have been together 3 years living together for 1 and she s ready to marry
9143344 hello it aint gonna happen and if it does do you really want to look back and feel that you had to trap your man into marriage
9143345 i wouldnt move in with a boyfriend unless i had a ring and a date
9143346 some of my friends think i need to go on and marry him to catch him but nick is already mine they dont understand that though children are not an issue were both in our early 50s and neither of us can have anymore children we only have my high school age children with us his son is almost an adult so there is no having his baby to catch him
9143347 if i feel committed enough to want to live with the woman im with i will buy the ring and ask her to marry me because obviously i feel she s the woman for me to spend the rest of my life with proponents of shacking up will say that if a couple shacks up and doesnt get married it s good that they found out they werent meant for each other before they walked down the aisle to that i say if you cant determine that the person youre with isnt someone you can grow with for the rest of your life just from dating them over a period of time without living together youre either not very perceptive or not ready to marry anyone at all my parents have been married for over 26 years i long to have a marriage like that and wont settle for less
9143348 in the present form g 8 already does not carry enough weight
9143349 we are not afraid not at all whats needed is a realistic analysis of the situation looking to future so as to develop a normal relationship with due regard to each others interests
9143350 there is no question of cosmetic or otherwise what we are really asking is there are certain issues on which there are certain red lines drawn by us because those are the commitments that had been made by our prime minister
9143351 on red lines we cannot thats what we told our parliament that these are sacrosanct and if these are not met we cannot endorse the agreement
9143352 we have always made the point that testing is a word that we find difficult to adjust to not because of anything else but because that is what parliament has mandated us to do
9143353 i presume testing will be difficult for us to so we will find ways around it we are clear that whatever we finally agree to in nsg should be something that we can sell to parliament
9143354 rubbish rumours of renewing wedding vows i think once was enough and ive just paid out on a big party for her birthday
9143355 i bought her two original hermes drawings of equestrian thingies sic but trust me the party was infinitely more expensive than the paintings
9143356 there is no question of cosmetic or otherwise what we are really asking is there are certain issues on which there are certain red lines drawn by us because those are the commitments that had been made by our prime minister
9143357 on red lines we cannot thats what we told our parliament that these are sacrosanct and if these are not met we cannot endorse the agreement
9143358 we have always made the point that testing is a word that we find difficult to adjust to not because of anything else but because that is what parliament has mandated us to do
9143359 i presume testing will be difficult for us to so we will find ways around it we are clear that whatever we finally agree to in nsg should be something that we can sell to parliament
9143360 mr holycoast given the beating the president and the gop took in 2005 because of their slow response to hurricane katrina leaving an entire city of black people to drown are you afraid that continuing with the convention will look bad in the eyes of the voters
9143361 well stooge as you know despite barack obamas promise to reduce sea levels should he be elected hes still only a candidate so he hasnt had a chance to get that done yet and theres not much any of us mere mortals can do to control a monster storm like gustav
9143362 didnt look like any of the other presidents on the dollar bills
9143363 its surprising to see republicans so excited about a woman candidate
9143364 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9143365 we send our congratulations to governor palin and her family on her designation as the republican nominee for vice president her selection is yet another encouraging sign that all barriers are falling in our politics and while we obviously have differences over how to best lead this country forward governor palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9143366 you know i havent met her before she seems like a compelling person obviously a terrific story personal story
9143367 and you know im sure that she will help make the case for the republicans unfortunately the case is more of the same and so ultimately john mccain is at the top of the ticket as i indicated in my speech last night i think that he wants to take the country in the wrong direction im assuming governor palin agrees with him in his policies but the fact that shes been nominated i think or soon will be nominated i think is one more indicator of this country moving forward the fact that youve got a woman as the nominee of one of the as the vice presidential nominee of one of the major parties i think is one more hit against the glass ceiling and i congratulate her and look forward to a vigorous debate im pleased with my choice for vice president joe biden i think hes the man who can help me guide this country in a better direction and help working families
9143368 you know i think that you know campaigns start getting these hair triggers and that statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments
9143369 a terrific candidate and that he looked forward to seeing her on the campaign trail
9143370 i knew as i closed the final page that this was the film i had been looking to direct
9143371 the story spoke to me on so many levels both personal and artistic
9143372 the women in johns early life truly shaped who he became and the strengths and weaknesses of their relationships are central to this film
9143373 im truly excited at the prospect of sam taylor wood bringing her singular artistic vision to the story
9143374 in the four films starring kate we are given dream sequences that invite us to imagine how we might fulfil her desires

9143376 shes exactly who this country needs to help us fight the same old washington politics of me first and country second

9143523 nach derzeitigen informationen wurden am tatort spuren gefunden die die vermutung nahe legen dass die sch sse auf das fahrzeug aus deutschen waffen abgegeben worden sind ob auch von anderer seite auf das fahrzeug geschossen wurde ist noch nicht abschlie end gekl rt
9143524 es gibt zurzeit keinen grund den deutschen soldaten einen vorwurf zu machen
9143525 die t tung von afghanischen zivilisten unter mitverantwortung deutscher soldaten spitzt die lage extrem zu
9143526 im sumpf eines schmutzigen krieges zu versinken der den terror nicht bek mpft sondern zu neuer gewaltbereitschaft f hrt in der zivile aufbaubem hungen untergehen
9143527 spirale ger t in der afghanen nur noch als verd chtig angesehen werden und auf der anderen seite die afghanen angst vor den deutschen soldaten bekommen
9143528 als er dann zwei drei tage nicht da war dachten wir er w re vielleicht in urlaub gefahren
9143529 naja man denkt ja dass man hilfe kriegt wenn mal etwas ist
9143530 wenn es ein medizinisches problem gibt empfehlen wir die notrufnummer 110 zu w hlen
9143531 aber ich kann zumindest heute noch nicht erkennen wof r wir als betreiber die verantwortung bernehmen sollen
9143532 die frau hofmann die sozialarbeiterin anm d red hat viel zu wenig stunden sie kann das alles gar nicht schaffen
9143533 fr her hatten wir hier einen richtigen pflegedienst mit im haus aber der wurde schon vor jahren abgeschafft
9143534 die hatten nicht genug zu tun und das lohnte sich dann wohl nicht mehr
9143535 wir haben den betreuungsvertrag abschlie en m ssen sonst h tten sie die wohnung gar nicht bekommen
9143536 es soll ja jetzt alles besser werden das haben sie uns versprochen
9143537 the statistics show a dangerous trend the scenario is quite fearsome
9143538 bangalore is one of indias fastest growing cities but it is sad that a modern city like bangalore with the best of amenities witnesses a rapid rise in suicide deaths
9143539 in bangalore all are stressed out be it a child an it professional or a migrant labour the city does not provide social and mental security to its wide range of population
9143540 most of our callers suffer from stress and a sense of loneliness and deprivation often we counsel the callers over the phone and if one is ready to visit us personally we encourage them to do so till date we have counselled around 3 600 persons
9143541 work related insecurity extended working hours and stringent deadlines contribute to rising number of suicides in the city no one has time for anyone we are all becoming very very self centric severing us from all human bonding and love thus a sense of insecurity is driving many to end their lives

9143544 they were all in this together and it is a tragic situation
9143545 its inaccurate to say we were all in this together
9143546 what is it exactly that the vp does every day
9143547 you still have this group of women out there who are uncertain for the democrats
9143548 this is a large attempt to go after that vote
9143549 my guess is hes trying to appeal to women and younger people
9143550 the assumption is given his age and medical history he has to get someone who is a plausible occupant for the oval office palin will have a tough time making that case
9143551 john mccain and sarah palin offer proven leadership as opposed to the democrats who only talk about change but the issues that they talk about are out of the 60s and 70s
9143552 i think it had some traction with some voters it was certainly something that gave people pause
9143553 she even comes with a ready made investigation of her office
9143554 maybe if you were governor of california or new york that would be true
9143555 all anyone has been talking about but no one here knows who she is
9143556 this is going to bring so many hillary clinton voters to the republicans
9143557 can you reassure voters in this country that you would have the discipline you would need on the world stage
9143558 do you agree with sen harry reid democratic majority leader that the iraq war is lost
9143559 who cares how many words it takes joe biden tells it like it is and he knows what hes talking about after these eight years thats the change we need
9143560 that phrase dont tell them more than you know is some of the best advice i have ever received i put it into practice constantly
9143561 for seven years weve pounded the pavement for 200 plus shows a year
9143562 its an amazing honor for us and our fans to see the growth of this grassroots effort independently reach billboard success
9143563 blessed with a soaring vocal that has an operatic timbre to it texas brandon rhyder has come a long way in just a short amount of time have i waited too long starts off the record and immediately showcases that vocal along with the other thing that sets rhyder apart the lyric writing the song is a self written slow building piece of ear candy that only sounds better with each successive listen in fact thats a general feeling i get about the whole album
9143564 this album is pure country infused with what listeners have come to expect from brandon rhyder this collection of songs conveys a fresh sound and perhaps a new direction for the songwriter this album weaves its way through regret friends family infidelity longing leaving staying and happiness and what a journey it is i wouldnt be surprised if one day we turn on the radio to more than one of these tracks and maybe even sung by one of todays top country artists
9143565 with radney foster at the helm is decidely more polished than rhyders previous efforts
9143566 qpr have always had good entertaining showman type players and that is what their fans demand
9143567 the little argentinian is certainly one of them and we have to be well aware of him
9143568 he likes to come in off the right and smack the ball and is certainly one of their dangerous players
9143569 qpr have brought some very very good footballers over the summer and they will be there or thereabouts come the end of the season
9143570 we were disappointed not to beat derby at home after a really solid first half performance
9143571 that we are disappointed to have drawn with a team that was in the premiership last year shows how far we have come over the last 12 months
9143572 we want to make ashton gate a place where we get the majority of our points because that is where they have to come
9143573 we were disappointed with what happened at crewe but we have to bounce back
9143574 we need to get more quality crosses in and shots on goal because that was something that was poor the other night
9143575 it will be a great footballing game and we have to make sure that we dont play in a way that suits them
9143576 they are very good when they have the ball but so are we
9143577 it will be up to us to try and wrestle the ball away from them and create opportunities and do better with them than we did at crewe
9143578 sometimes teams who lose the play off final can find the following season something of a hangover but i cant see that happening with city
9143579 gary johnson was my manager at cambridge and i know he isnt someone to dwell on the past
9143580 city are a footballing side and theyre a well supported club with the potential to be a massive force
9143581 they beat coventry who had won all their games up to then and although they lost in the carling cup at crewe i know they rested some key players so well certainly be showing them respect
9143582 we should have won at ashton gate last season so we want to put that right this time and although i think a point would be a good result well be going there for all three
9143583 we want to play at the highest possible level with the best possible facilities and thats what im going to work towards and thats what gary johnson is going to work towards as well
9143584 we have our own plan of how we go about doing things thats not going to change we go about our job quietly but efficiently if you look at the record over the last however many years theres been constant investment in the football club and thats all you can ask for
9143585 we are working on opportunities to take the club forward and were there to compete with the likes of qpr
9143586 the stadium is progressing satisfactorily its a long process so there are no sudden announcements to make its on target at the moment and thats all i can really say there are lots of difficult decisions to be made and we are working our way through those
9143587 we knew qpr would spend some money in the summer and bring in some good foreign players
9143588 with their italian links theyve been able to get in a few from the italian league and theyve got the lad from real madrid those players wouldnt normally be coming to the championship if it wasnt for finances of qpr
9143589 it happens in other places at liverpool rafael benitez has brought in spaniards as has roberto martinez at swansea arsene wenger brought a french influence to arsenal and weve brought a yeovil influence to bristol city ive been very happy with that by the way
9143590 weve also been spreading the net ourselves and believe we know whats out there at the right time well do the right thing
9143591 at the moment were third in the league and want to stay up there we have to produce the kind of performance we did in the first half against derby for both halves tomorrow
9143592 we had worked very hard on saturday and maybe i should have made some changes but we wanted to keep the continuity
9143593 nobody wanted to be rested but our mental game wasnt good and the quality wasnt there we let crewe dictate and when that happens you get beat

9143615 the errors that doctors make because of their feelings for a patient can be significant we all want to believe that our physician likes us and is moved by our plight doctors in turn are encouraged to develop positive feelings for their patients caring is generally held to be the cornerstone of humanistic medicine sometimes however a doctors impulse to protect a patient he likes or admires can adversely affect his judgment

9143628 i dont know the degree to which ron paul people will actively campaign for the mccain palin ticket
9143629 my own personal opinion is that there are a lot of very good people in the ron paul campaign and had proclaimed their support for ron paul
9143630 i dont think the party gains anything by trying to drive those people from the party
9143631 we havent had any problems at all its real remarkable
9143632 the ron paul people were pretty upset for a while they were sad they lost
9143633 i spent this morning with a former ron paul delegate fixing gop candidate dino rossi signs that had been vandalized
9143634 as we talked about the rally congressman paul is planning in minneapolis we realized the need for the republican tent to be a big one and that we both look forward to working together to elect our nominee

9143642 ive thought about it weve talked about it and if we keep performing like we are there is no reason why we cant win 5 0

9143666 the police have always been able to look into whatever they want but the information age changes the scale of that completely
9143667 parents should know that this is not for the protection of their children it could be used to prosecute them this is a serious step on from what little has been told to the public
9143668 the purpose of contactpoint is not crime detection it is to help improve services to children including safeguarding vulnerable children
9143669 to access contactpoint for the purposes of prevention or detection of crime or for the prosecution of offenders police would have to make a special request directly to the secretary of state or local authority and make a case for disclosure

9143688 there has been no improvement in the ground situation so far hence the conditions are still not conducive for resuming work today
9143689 there is no question of cosmetic or otherwise what we are really asking is there are certain issues on which there are certain red lines drawn by us because those are the commitments that had been made by our prime minister
9143690 on red lines we cannot thats what we told our parliament that these are sacrosanct and if these are not met we cannot endorse the agreement
9143691 we have always made the point that testing is a word that we find difficult to adjust to not because of anything else but because that is what parliament has mandated us to do
9143692 i presume testing will be difficult for us to so we will find ways around it

9143709 last night hillary told us in no uncertain terms she is going to do everything she can to elect barack obama
9143710 hillary moving for acclamation just put the good housekeeping stamp of approval on the whole thing
9143711 it totally worked i told you it would create more unity than trying to force unity by ignoring the divisions
9143712 i never had any doubt that hillary would do what she did she is a true star putting the country ahead of herself

9143716 if this becomes a huge monstrous story well make a game time assessment
9143717 they see their jobs shipped overseas theyve seen the cost of everything from healthcare to college to gas to food skyrocket even though their incomes and their wages havent gone up
9143718 john mccain just does not get what ordinary people here in beaver pa are going through
9143719 is not just what it means for them but what it means to their children or their grandchildren
9143720 you know that if we keep going the way were going
9143721 a whole lot of young people growing up in beaver are going to decide that they cant make a living and they dont have a future here

9143735 this sort of practice has been going on throughout the islamic world for centuries and although there have been cases like this in the past they havent been brought to court
9143736 because of this case this practice has now been highlighted and this law is now being brought to the attention of the community before our community didnt know about the law
9143737 the community and community leaders are now working together with the crown prosecution service and the police to bring about a code of practice to benefit everyone
9143738 we cannot eliminate this practice but we can and will work to a code of practice so that the children dont get hurt the law isnt broken and the people who do want to take part dont get prosecuted
9143739 we have to take into account peoples beliefs and their rights and we will respect them but we are not above the law and we never will be and working with the authorities is the best chance weve got to prevent any harm being brought against any children
9143740 the best way of achieving our aims now is to try and understand the law better and work within the law to move forward
9143741 profits should not be put above the risk to public health and there had been a significant risk

9143743 i have since remarried and have five children and i believe that she continues to harbor resentment towards me and the desire to have information about me

9143747 ramadan is the best time for people to quit smoking cigarettes and chewing tobacco for good while people are fasting they will need help with cravings so i will be visiting mosques across the city to provide advice and support also to help people quit we provide nicotine patches

9143749 where arises the question of a peace formula or compromise formula when the fourth round of talks between governors panel and the samitis committee has not taken place so far sayss spokesperson
9143750 during the first three rounds of talk on august 23 we have already given written demands to the governors panel headed by his advisor s s bloeria
9143751 the fourth round of talks was delayed twice and is now scheduled for today and we are waiting for it to be held
9143752 the government has to respond to our demands and then the samiti will decide on it
9143753 over the last two decades in the us even while flu vaccination rates among the elderly have increased from 15 to 65 percent there has been no commensurate decrease in hospital admissions or all cause mortality
9143754 further only about 10 percent of winter time deaths in the us are attributable to influenza thus to suggest that the vaccine can reduce 50 percent of deaths from all causes is implausible in our opinion
9143755 was very small and statistically non significant and may simply be a healthy user artifact that they were unable to identify
9143756 previous studies were likely measuring a benefit not directly attributable to the vaccine itself but something specific to the individuals who were vaccinated a healthy user benefit or frailty bias
9143757 the healthy user effect is seen in what doctors often refer to as their good patients patients who are well informed about their health who exercise regularly do not smoke or have quit drink only in moderation take their medications exactly as prescribed and quite religiously get vaccinated each year so as to stay healthy
9143758 such attributes are almost impossible to capture in large scale studies using administrative databases
9143759 i am confident that this year too we will be more or less correct on our assessment of gdp growth and the economy will grow close to 8 0 per cent

9143779 there has been no improvement in the ground situation so far hence the conditions are still not conducive for resuming work today
9143780 he had some tests done and the results show that he has a thyroid malfunction
9143781 then he had a cardiogram test done and that test shows that
9143782 it is very effective some people dont believe in it but people who do really get a good result
9143783 after that my friends who work at garment factories in phnom penh advised me to apply the lubricant from number one plus condoms on my face every night
9143784 it was agreed that we would begin the process of developing a comparative project involving between fifteen and twenty european countries to examine the interrelatedness of the mathematics related beliefs of teachers and students teacher practices and student cognition
9143785 to assume that the development of enthusiasm is sufficient to guarantee achievement would be na ve as there are countries in which students have little enthusiasm for mathematics but achieve relatively highly and of course vice versa
9143786 one of the problems of english education is that students experience a fragmented and procedural conception of mathematics due to underlying notions of vocationalism and so rarely come to see the subject as a coherent body of concepts and relationships which can be worth studying for the intrinsic satisfaction it can yield
9143787 the situation in countries like hungary is almost the complete opposite all students experience an integrated and intellectually worthwhile mathematics taught by teachers with little explicit interest in the applications of the subject but an enthusiasm for logical thinking and the problem solving opportunities that mathematics can provide
9143788 where teachers do not necessarily expect to teach students in ability groups but expect to work with the full ability range achievement is generally higher across the board
9143789 casino carpet is known as an exercise in deliberate bad taste that somehow encourages people to gamble
9143790 people always dont notice the rainbows in the carpet but they have a perception of good luck
9143791 you dont want a real plain carpet because people drop cigarettes on it and spill drinks on it
9143792 it is the same thing as putting canopies on tops of gambling tables which has become popular that lowers the ceiling people dont look up at the spaciousness and concentrate more where the action is
9143793 the fact is at the places that have the most play the attention of the visitors are focused on the gaming equipment just like in a department store which frank winfield woolworth thought of in 1878
9143794 what would be the real issue here is gambling is a hyper experience nobody gambles to relax they gamble for the adrenalin rush therefore it is possible that a more exciting carpet pattern will create a more exciting atmosphere but nobody has ever demonstrated that
9143795 i am not arguing against it but i could not find the impact
9143796 but i emphasize that doesnt mean it is not there
9143797 note the regal tones of caesars palace the bountiful bouquet of mandalay place the soft almost abstract pointillism of paris all whispering gamble gamble just out of the range of consciousness as people walk to the nearest slot machine
9143798 you are trying to create an ambiance that is going to encourage people to stick around and play
9143799 so you cant treat carpets all by themselves they are part of the integrated pull
9143800 in that world it is not enough simply to provide games and play one has to understand as deeply as possible what play is and then build playgrounds
9143801 you want to get that sense of vibrancy and energy that something is going on
9143802 the curve welcomes us and the oversharp angle rejects us the angle is masculine and the curve feminine the beloved curve has nest like powers it incites us to possession it is a curved corner inhabited geometry
9143803 the most enticing and alluring and stimulating casino spaces are those which make principal use of the curvilinear rather than the straight
9143804 many of the carpets use flowers and wheels both suggestive of a cyclical life flowers bud bloom and then die and their beauty is only ephemeral
9143805 the wheel was famous to the romans note its prominence at caesars palace as a symbol of the relentless capriciousness of fortune
9143806 cpuc staff is looking into allegations concerning t mobile cell siting
9143807 to work within all relevant and appropriate siting guidelines and regulations
9143808 if we receive details alleging otherwise we would promptly investigate the matter and take any appropriate action
9143809 i raised questions about these activities with glotel i mentioned that this was not the proper process and they fired me
9143810 those movements carefully position the flys centre of mass relative to the jumping legs so that leg extension propels them away from the looming threat
9143811 no matter how much our message is ignored or ridiculed as was done in the campaign no matter how much they did to us it only energized our grass roots
9143812 our focus is really on this side of the river
9143813 we think theres enough excitement and energy on this side
9143814 we only want to cause noise in the sense of letting people know there are other movements out there that other people believe in
9143815 there have been sculptures on that roundabout for 15 years without any problems i put a lot of heart into creating these sculptures and feel gutted i am going to have to take them down you take it on the chin when people say they do not like your art but to have to remove it because it is a giant spider is hard to take
9143816 my client says his partner persistently wakes him during the night requiring sex and he finds this very difficult to deal with
9143817 he says her insatiable appetite of sex has caused a lot of problems between them
9143818 we put the screws down one side to hold it down so it wont blow away but the council were claiming it was a permanent structure and said we had to take it down
9143819 the company spends about 6 billion a year on programming to give our customers the best content and the most video choices
9143820 while we have been aggressive at controlling costs we expect continued increases in programming particularly in sports
9143821 theyre raising rates on individual service to push people to bundles because that means they get more money but the reality is now consumers have fewer and fewer choices
9143822 with the addition of a marketplace the android ecosystem is becoming even more robust
9143823 i am incredibly energized by the support and amazing content ive seen so far
9143824 we already had a messaging service that can work over text messages so when we started developing a mobile app we wanted to take a huge step up from that
9143825 android is the only platform where every phone will have gps an accelerometer and where the application can run in the background
9143826 what developers want is to code for a few platforms and reach a large audience people have been developing for the iphone because of coolness factor but also because the iphone 3g has huge distribution around the world
9143827 it will come down to how fast android can build market share and create a compelling market
9143828 even though the track has been pretty consistent you just dont know
9143829 im not sure thats a huge worry or a signal that somethings changing in the market
9143830 we usually do see a bump right before a holiday weekend
9143831 the formation of gustav has really put a stop to the drop in crude oil
9143832 if we didnt have this storm we could be talking about crude oil dropping below 110
9143833 we dont like to say its routine but weve been through it many times
9143834 we generally pay the lowest we pay for gas all year in the next few months so barring a hurricane drivers can probably look forward to that
9143835 but remember the trend of the last few years is prices never go down as far as they went up
9143836 basically there are a bunch of people that are coming from twitter over to blip fm
9143837 weve allowed users to integrate their blip account with twitter friendfeed pownce jaiku and tumblr accounts in other words when you blip on blip fm it will also appear as a tweet on twitter
9143838 my favorite description is that if twitter and last fm had a love child it would be blip fm its funny how things come out in web 2 0 parlance

9143845 extremely important non violent action taken by tibetans under the leadership of the dalai lama in a very critical period for tibet particularly the post olympic period
9143846 this is not a protest led by hatred rancour and anger but by the teachings of the lord buddha to refrain from harming others
9143847 our condolence and homage to those who lost their lives and those who were imprisoned tortured and beaten in the recent uprisings in tibet
9143848 reforming admissions policies would be a good place to start in stopping discrimination
9143849 90 of the population have been ruled out straight away

9143851 we dont want to try to emulate beijing what we want is new ways of thinking about the opening ceremony
9143852 we want the whole of london to be involved with different parts of london taking part in the ceremony the london games must be deeply democratic with the citys citizens feeling theyre intimately involved
9143853 in terms of great organisation fantastic facilities and a welcoming attitude and pride among the people beijing was superb but there are things we can and will do better
9143854 i saw lots and lots of chinese people standing outside stadiums on the wrong part of a perimeter fence as observers rather than participants we must reverse that trend and make sure our olympics are more accessible
9143855 i also want to minimise the number of empty seats in stadiums which frustrate the public and keep them at a distance for no reason

9143859 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9143860 this was a pretty significant drop that we coordinated with ia ca team
9143861 coalition forces have generally had no presence with these sorts of aid drops but because of the size of this drop we stepped in to provide assistance and security
9143862 the backpacks and pencil sets are greatly needed for our children as they get ready to return to school for this term the children also like the footballs
9143863 with minimal notice these combat engineers continue the proud tradition of performing an array of engineer and infantry tasks with great flexibility
9143864 our route clearance teams are out there every day ensuring the mobility of not only u s forces but that of ia forces its a tedious job that requires a lot of concentration and attention to detail but our sappers are always up for the task
9143865 given the rapid development of equipment in support of operation iraqi freedom the equipment we use relies on a solid maintenance program and junior leaders with an eye for detail it is no easy task
9143866 a little before new years we lost one of our soldiers pfc
9143867 were actually down two guys as we lost one of our other guys pfc rene medina in kuwait due to an illness
9143868 were deploying with these guys were training with them for a full year and to not have them around is really like losing a little brother
9143869 we oversee a group of soldiers who operate and monitor the advanced field artillery tactical data system the radio transmission operator and the counter fire officer
9143870 we monitor all of the radar tracks that come in from any mnd b area of operations
9143871 any time theres an idf event we answer all of the five
9143872 we also assist the brigades with deconfliction of airspace for counter fire but our primary mission is to provide the division chain of command with an accurate picture of whats going on in the battlefield as it relates to idf
9143873 you dont always know when the enemys going to strike you always have to keep on the top of your toes and wait for that next mission to happen
9143874 were watching 24 7 for the enemy to strike and the enemy knows that too theyve not been too successful at firing at us lately because we come right back at them
9143875 we started to see a pattern and put air assets in the area
9143876 i think the division has done a really good job with certain things like player of the day in fact i believe that all of our soldiers have got to partake in that
9143877 if you go up to our battle nco station youll see a picture of some of us including the two soldiers they lost together at the baggage drop a couple of days before the deployment
9143878 everybodys smiling we trained hard and guys were ready to go ahead and knock out the 15 months together the photo is fading slightly from being on that work station for nine months already but it will make it all the way to the last day of the deployment and well take it home with us
9143879 theyre the best ive got the best section in the army
9143880 there cant be a battledrill done as far as idf goes if it wasnt for those guys sitting in front of those screens letting us know something is going on
9143881 i think we have some of the most competent most brilliant and hard working leaders and soldiers in the army they have stepped up to the challenges theyve performed without any reservations constantly going in and out of the wire protecting the force by trying to locate the enemy
9143882 wha what ar re you what do you w wa want from me

9143890 god forgive me please release me from this nightmare and bring me peace
9143891 but i shall grant you release i will release you from your mortality by baptizing you in the fire of the most exquisite pain you shall ever feel fear it for there is no peace or escape

9143918 katherine is a defensive warrior who uses her strength very well she is very difficult to get around and covers her ground very quickly

9143923 shes a good communicator on the field and keeps her defense organized
9143924 patricia has a nose for the goal and puts herself into positions to get good shots off
9143925 carly is a strong player on the ball and can shoot from the outside
9143926 gabby is difficult to defend because shes a great passer and can turn on the dribble and beat just about anyone with a quick shot
9143927 patricia has a nose for the goal and puts herself into position to get good shots off
9143928 and madison is one of our quickest players shes a good shooter and puts pressure on the ball on defense

9143936 they have seven starters on defense thats their strength they have a couple of good running backs they can run the ball
9143937 we have our work cut out for us right out of the box ive watched the san jose state and louisiana tech games nevada plays hard and has an excellent running game we played pitt last year and i think they are better than pittsburgh
9143938 personally id rather play savannah state alcorn state alabama a amp m or somebody like that to play a division i team there is no benefit except maybe financial
9143939 were not going to ask him dillon to do a whole lot
9143940 we want him to manage the game we have a pretty good defense and kicking game we want to shorten the game and hopefully well hang in there for a while
9143941 they grambling play a lot of cover 1 and cover 3 and they will blitz too
9143942 you was told invasive not a whit mistrusting escape clause not on route to say a retrogression reinforcer

9143944 im sad im disappointed and im angry here are few of my many many questions about this fiasco
9143945 im now convinced that a large segment of the charismatic church will follow the anti christ when he shows up because they have no discernment

9143988 what youre going to see is the product of three years of planning training and exercising at all levels of government starting with the local and the state level and leading up to the federal level

9144000 with a negro by my side rather i should die a thousand times and see old glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels a throwback to the blackest specimen from the wilds

9144003 indeed some of israels best friends and most articulate defenders can be found in the blogosphere little green footballs atlas shrugs hugh hewitt and debbie schlussel all provide a refreshing alternative to the moral relativism and politically correct anti israel blather of the media
9144004 we are perishing for want of wonder not for want of wonders
9144005 if you can become aware of the miraculousness which i symbolise you can help save the freedom mankind is unhappily losing
9144006 i went to a third set the other match in my second round so i didnt want to do that
9144007 i was a little bit frustrated with myself in the first set i was serving well and holding my serves and doing quite well then in the second set i dont know what happened i just lost my rhythm throughout the whole match i had a really bad percentage of first serves and mainly playing with second serves which obviously doesnt help
9144008 im sure the match against li will be a tough one
9144009 and it will be tough for both of us because weve played against each other a year ago and it was really very close match
9144010 we have got four or five irons in the fire at the moment two of which are pretty well down the line and three which are could bes maybes and he zayatte is one of those could be maybes
9144011 we have had him training he looks like a player who could certainly improve us
9144012 i know south africans really well they dont want to lose
9144013 they would have wanted to have beaten us at trent bridge and again theyre very very proud people very stubborn people
9144014 its the pressure that were putting on their batters bowling at 90mph and then our batters are hitting their good deliveries for four and really commanding respect
9144015 ive thought about it weve talked about it and if we keep performing like we are there is no reason why we cant win 5 0
9144016 it puts extra pressure on us because it takes us up to second but thats the kind of pressure i want
9144017 if hes not here i have my players hes one more important player quality velocity many things but i have very very good players here
9144018 if peter doesnt buy robinho i have 23 who are here training and playing if we want one more player with quality peter tries to buy him if he doesnt come he doesnt come i have players for that position no problem
9144019 in the past i have 70 wins in derbies and almost 50 of derbies end as draws i am different to other coaches
9144020 racing and bolton have reached an agreement for the loan of ebi smolarek to the british team until june 30 2009 as well as that the english outfit have an option to buy the polish striker
9144021 the players look forward to it and i think everybody in the state looks forward to it
9144022 we are disappointed by cus decision as we believe the series ultimately belongs in denver
9144023 however in light of cus decision to play the 2009 game in boulder we believe we owe it to colorado state university our alumni fans students and the city of fort collins to bring the 2010 game back to hughes stadium
9144024 i have a lot of fond memories at invesco right now hopefully many many more
9144025 this is the big show the dance just walking out of the tunnel and looking up and seeing the bronco head in the end zone its just a surreal feeling
9144026 you can see two ways as far as an opener you can get one that maybe is a little easier than going out against a bcs school but this is a perfect game to play this is as good a setting as there is in college football and it would be a shame if we ruined it
9144027 i dont have any items from today perhaps you forgot it in your house
9144028 too bad you are basically screwed if you loose your phone
9144029 if capello is going to let owen and rooney grow into the partnership i believe they can become then areas of the pitch have to become no go areas for rooney
9144030 the biggest accusation being thrown at rooney at the moment is that he is constantly playing out of position
9144031 thats just about everything you can be on a football pitch except being the one thing we all want him to be an out and out striker
9144032 okay i agree they havent exactly set the world alight yet
9144033 the patch is to correct issues related to the p47 found in the wwii fighters pack for microsoft flight simulator x only and not needed for those who are running microsoft flight simulator 2004
9144034 ill never forget those kids believing and trusting in new ideas
9144035 we worked very hard and there was a lot of great leadership on that team and some very good players
9144036 the game wasnt trying to send a message about the year before the year before wasnt our concern
9144037 after a season like last year everybodys going to go ok what are you guys gonna do
9144038 are you guys going to completely fold or are you guys going to step it up
9144039 to see him get hit in the head you know its not a good thing
9144040 they were on top of it and you have to give the south carolina team a lot of credit because they helped too
9144041 i just told them hes in medical hands and hes in gods hands
9144042 to see a guy out there like that its hard but the hangover from that wasnt why we lost today
9144043 other than losing a great player i dont think there was an emotional hangover that caused us to lose
9144044 jack cosgrove is a guy who ive known now for quite some time
9144045 hes just done a great great job with the program over a long period of time
9144046 a lot of guys got good experience last year and i think theyre looking for improvement just like what were hoping to see from our football team too
9144047 you know this is no new thing for them to travel to a bcs conference place
9144048 theyve been on the road theyve played in big stadiums they go to florida state next year and my guess is theyll come in here revved up and ready to go and we expect a tough contest
9144049 i dont know a specific number but i would say winning a national championship was the least influencing thing in my decision to come back
9144050 i think the main thing was to just experience what is the love of ohio state that would be the highest percent thing you take it for granted and if you actually get to sit and be like im playing football for ohio state university youd actually realize how much youre loved by people
9144051 well you mentioned 19 returning guys and i mentioned that we have 40 guys who have been there entering their fourth or their fifth year
9144052 one of the things weve discussed a lot is making sure that we continue to challenge guys and not have them come into preseason camp thinking its the same old same old
9144053 its great to go against them in practice just because you know theyre so good that theyre going to make you even that much better and its just nice to get so many opportunities to have the ball in your hands to score some points
9144054 everybodys telling pryor how good he is and how he can come in and start but when he gets here its different within the team
9144055 he can be fooled almost by the media or by the recruiting process once he gets here its like a humbling process its like that with every freshman you just have to bring them back down to earth
9144056 well among the ohio state faithful were expected to win the conference every year
9144057 i dont know if it adds anything i think when our guys come to play at ohio state or come to coach at ohio state they understand that the expectation is that we want to deserve to be big ten champions
9144058 this game was a chance to show what we had
9144059 the defense played well but we still have a long way to go if were going to be a good acc team
9144060 i was impressed with a lot of guys on defense until the fourth quarter when they got tired
9144061 the problem is that you want to substitute to get them out but the longer they stayed on the more you had a chance for cramping if you take them out to rest them then they dont make plays
9144062 our defense played a great game they kept fighting and getting the ball for us but we just couldnt get in
9144063 hes a different back than he was during the season
9144064 hes hungry hes got a chip on his shoulder hes very focused on what he wants to accomplish to help our team
9144065 its not like i lost 30 pounds or something i just worked hard in the offseason
9144066 the holes were good you could have driven a truck through them the wide receivers were blocking downfield overall they did a great job
9144067 hes a weapon in our offense and we want him back as soon as possible we need dre
9144068 it is like having a goal written out on the field to remind you during the toughs days when you are grinding it out and you look over and see that to be determined sign it kind of gets you back up and going
9144069 nobody said anything we just came out the first day and it was there but im almost 100 percent positive that is why
9144070 i feel confidence in both our defense and our offense so hopefully we can live up to the expectations if the offense and defense performs as well as i know we can we will be fine
9144071 i think the key for us is to play every game because in college football now you cant take anybody for granted if you do you are going to get beat
9144072 i know idaho will come in here and think they can win the game just like toledo will and new mexico will be a tough game when we go there
9144073 it has been cool we came together as a team and an offense
9144074 the bond we have for one another is better and i think that plays a role on the field we just feed off that energy
9144075 we felt like he deserved the opportunity and we gave it to him
9144076 i wanted griffin to get some time to look at the defense and get the feel of the game
9144077 its easy to be poised when you have the ability
9144078 i think griffin help motivate the team and he helped us get that first touchdown
9144079 you have to play like every game like it is the most important game of your life we had great support from our fans and i know i feel bad for letting them down
9144080 your son or daughter may have strayed once or twice
9144081 but i think you love them and hug them and take them back then you support them
9144082 its not going to make or break a team for a whole season
9144083 but its going to be one of those games that people remember for a long time because you have a stage
9144084 it would be really big for illini nation period for us to come out and beat missouri
9144085 were always going to be the underdog until we prove something
9144086 i grew up watching that game and its great to be a part of that
9144087 were coming out of camp on a pretty good feeling particularly in terms of all our guys being available to us
9144088 we look at this as other openers in the past
9144089 when you get that opening game under your belt with your team and all of those things going into your confidence down the schedule its important i particularly like the challenge of the matchup but we expect its going to be a very difficult game
9144090 its just like the light went on for the guys and they started to work together well
9144091 but they just kind of came together in terms of protections really is what jumped out first
9144092 the time frame that they have between when they last played and when they play now is the concern because they could do anything
9144093 he had an excellent season for us last year and performed well in training camp
9144094 its a championship game for us as everything is and were giving it everything weve got
9144095 were holding nothing back were not resting anybody and were not going to get somebody ready for a couple of weeks from now were going for it and thats the only way we know how to do it
9144096 i think theyll limit and play their best football players in the game i think appalachian played only a handful of numbers against michigan i think youll see that i think you have to be aware of any kind of trick type stuff on all sides of the ball
9144097 the similarities i guess is everybody is trying to use the whole field
9144098 and get it in a lot of peoples hands but they do a good job there as well its not an accident that theyve had quite a bit of success in the past
9144099 its gonna be a tremendous challenge no matter who plays texas tech
9144100 anyone in the country its gonna be a challenge on that defense and youre never gonna stop those guys theyre too good theyre too talented
9144101 catching up to the speed of their defense theyre obviously going to be a little faster than what we see everyday in practice with scout teams and everything
9144102 and i definitely dont want to make sportscenter for that we cant let that happen
9144103 all 18 years as a coach have gone fast its hard to believe were entering year 10 and thats a good thing at least i think it is some people may not im happy with it and i hope i can make 11
9144104 i think hes going to be great for our program for years to come hes obviously got a great track record coming from michigan hes coached a lot of great players
9144105 i just like how easily he made the transition for all of the receivers and just the team in general any time you go through a coaching change it could go one way or the other but i think that its definitely gone in a positive way
9144106 mario manningham and i are from the same town and i would talk to him and he would tell me the reason i was successful was because of erik campbell
9144107 and i didnt really know who erik campbell was obviously through the recruiting process i did
9144108 so when he came here it was like wow now i have the opportunity to play for this guy and take in everything hes going to teach me and convert it on to the field
9144109 if youre in coaching long enough youre going to coach a number of different positions
9144110 this is really my first job coaching running backs but ive coached about every other position on offense you know its exciting its a new opportunity youre learning new things
9144111 i just told someone else that im replacing carl jackson on the staff but ill never replace him
9144112 its obviously hard replacing a legend a great coach like that i think its new and exciting
9144113 obviously the tennessee game last year was a great experience the year before not such a good experience its great to get that tough test early were going to figure where we are
9144114 it just felt like kevin ended up very well last year in the armed forces bowl i think he brings a little more elusiveness to it being able to make some plays with legs a little bit more
9144115 i think everyone wants to get that taste out of their mouths
9144116 i dont think anyone wants to look back on that every game last year we were so close we just couldnt punch it in so we really want to go into cal and get that taste out of our mouths
9144117 we see him in practice and people who have an angle on him to catch him they just dont
9144118 its going to be exciting hopefully we can open up some holes and get him into some open field where he can really show off that speed
9144119 weve been going against each other for four weeks straight now and thats getting kind of tiring and i think im ready to just go out there and hit other people make a play and i think a lot of guys are
9144120 at fan appreciation day i think every person i saw wanted another hit like that against michigan state
9144121 the football monopoly in los angeles is officially over there
9144122 rey maualuga brian cushing taylor mays kevin ellison or insert any player from uscs d
9144123 the plate of crow he will be eating at the end of the season
9144124 we cant throw three interceptions we cant get down in the red zone and not come away with points in those situations
9144125 three interceptions one interception two interceptions however many its unacceptable
9144126 its my job to take care of the football next week thats going to be all my focus
9144127 weve got to look at it make quicker reads not stare things down
9144128 weve gotta throw the ball on time and if we do those things well be fine thats what weve talked to tyler about
9144129 i dont expect him to make those mistakes after being a year into the system
9144130 theres an expectation on our side of the ball of how we want to play
9144131 something we take pride in is taking care of the ball and i was guilty of not doing that its on me i gotta take care of my end of the bargain
9144132 yeah we all knew why we always bought gassers dont we nooo one we know ever trusted one of them deee zels
9144133 i am also looking to bring in one or two players
9144134 it was a good win but we arent sitting around here bragging about it
9144135 i went out and did everything i was supposed to do
9144136 the game is a lot slower now playing at linebacker but the transition is going good
9144137 it was a good way to pick up a win with a shutout coach johnson is an old school guy so that means that normally it will be a hard nosed game
9144138 it is great to step into a new program and get a shutout in the first game it is even better when we take the starters out and have our backups keep them from scoring
9144139 we gave a game ball to coach johnson for recording our first shutout also a game ball goes to strength and conditioning coach mark smith
9144140 one day he went out to the parking lot with a yardstick and figured out how many bumper stickers he could get out of a sheet of the sticky back paper
9144141 forest wasnt by nature a salesman he loved being in the shop he was an inventor and he knew he needed help to sell his new product
9144142 a county attorney might not have needed more than 100 bumper stickers to get noticed especially in a rural county
9144143 i looked at the fixtures and noticed straight away that west ham away was the third game in
9144144 the trip to upton park was the one that stood out to me for some reason i cant think why not long ago i was looking at the fixtures and thinking about
9144145 now here i am looking at when we are going to be playing against manchester united and chelsea and west ham of course
9144146 in case of sudden loss of cabin gravity a silly grin will appear on your face
9144147 the university became aware of a possible compliance issue involving a football student athlete
9144148 we have looked into the matter and communicated with big 12 and ncaa officials and found that there were no violations
9144149 the ncaa worked with texas tech and based on the information provided by the university there does not appear to be a violation
9144150 we had a student athlete with an issue and that had to do with papers being stacked right and now theyre stacked right
9144151 what happened last saturday was not arsenal and we needed to show it could not happen again
9144152 you take in the criticism but the key is that we knew ourselves we were rubbish and that we could have done so much better now we need to show our real selves and we did well against twente
9144153 we knew that we did not put in the needed performance at fulham
9144154 but what happens in between games is not so important the crucial thing is to respond well in the next game which we did
9144155 now we have another big game against newcastle and we need another response to what has happened before
9144156 michael is a very special player he is very important to this club and my vision for it
9144157 if other people do not share that it is their problem
9144158 if you are an average webmaster and just running a few sites i wouldnt worry about them being on the same ip address and i definitely wouldnt worry about them being on the same server thats something that everybody does
9144159 the first opener we could have won that game like that
9144160 the second one i told you it was a real good football team in wake forest with a minute and 20 seconds it was still 15 10 to the orange bowl team last year i didnt think we played very well against the huskies
9144161 and you cant blame them for not coming right now they dont have a reason other than the diehard fans who are there regardless we have to get those fans back in order to that we have to win
9144162 this is a great way to start the season off and get some more fans in those seats
9144163 i think this team is doing a great job as far as the mental part with the seasons we had but i do think we need this game
9144164 i really believe we need to win this game to start off the season the right way

9144166 this is going to end badly it is after all a film about palestine
9144167 i dont like you like that so stop suffocating me and wasting your time with me already
9144168 god better be prepared for the great ordeal that it is to meet me
9144169 if we reduce the armed robberies then we will reduce a lot of the homicides
9144170 with young people we used to see in their first introduction to the criminal justice system petty offenses like vandalism then larceny assault and drug dealing before they went on to something like robbery
9144171 im so disgusted with all this talk about raleigh being one of the best places to live thats a lie
9144172 how can you be one of the most attractive places when you dont even take care of your neediest citizens theres an interest in building five star restaurants and skyscrapers but no capacity to build people people are desperate we arent giving them choices
9144173 but we have lost sight of the people and their economic and spiritual condition
9144174 these parents are not raising their children thats the main thing children are out here in the street all times of the night and the parents dont know where they are and where are they getting these guns
9144175 by being aggressive we know we can reduce the number of victims
9144176 i saw the car seat there and i couldnt find the baby
9144177 i picked up the baby and took off running and carried it to the ambulance
9144178 ive always wondered why there wasnt a crossing signal there
9144179 we want to ensure that these crossings are improved for safety and to meet increased train and highway traffic
9144180 they had their whole life ahead of them a new baby and everything
9144181 i made a covenant with my eyes not to look lustfully at a girl

9144183 natuurlik leef ons in n menslike liggaam maar ons voer nie die stryd met menslike wapens nie
9144184 i am amazed at the lengths people will go to to avoid paying tax by lying cheating hiding and a multitude of other creative criminalities when there are so many simple and perfectly legal ways to do it
9144185 theyre like shades to hide the sun if theres a deep ball in the sky
9144186 its so hard to get pass blocking right because you have to get everything just right to cover all your bases
9144187 he says hes going to stay in and sometimes hell leave anyway
9144188 oh yeah i plan at least at least two sacks this game
9144189 i know im going to get 100 yards i know what im doing now

9144193 inequities in health avoidable health inequities arise because of the circumstances in which people grow live work and age and the systems put in place to deal with illness
9144194 the conditions in which people live and die are in turn shaped by political social and economic forces

9144200 we see quite a few states where the number of schools selling junk food in vending machines is very low
9144201 in many places schools are substituting healthier choices and continuing to bring in revenue
9144202 it shows these changes are possible to make all states face the same economic challenges that lead schools to make money by selling junk food this dramatic progress made in states with strong leadership shows the other schools it can be done

9144260 and what happens when mccain cant serve she has less experience than obama does
9144261 its brilliant that all her hard work has paid off over many many years shes shown such determination and motivation

9144285 i am going to make an offer to the government and the united nations to participate in a joint investigation to make sure that we have come as close as we can to everybody knowing the truth of what happened in azizabad
9144286 acknowledge again and explicitly that this nation remains engaged in an armed conflict with al qaida the taliban and associated organizations who have already proclaimed themselves at war with us and who are dedicated to the slaughter of americans
9144287 it may start decreasing in september depending upon upstream discharge
9144288 we are facing labor problems law and order problems and logistics problems
9144289 the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience
9144290 her selection is yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics
9144291 while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward gov palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9144292 she seems like a compelling person obviously a terrific story personal story and im sure that she will help make the case for the republicans unfortunately the case is more of the same
9144293 is one more indicator of this country moving forward the fact that youve got a woman
9144294 vice presidential nominee of one of the major parties i think is one more hit against that glass ceiling
9144295 i think you know campaigns start getting these hair triggers and the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments
9144296 he also wished her good luck but not too much luck
9144297 it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9144298 the people of alaska many of them got tired of the ego issues out there with longer term federal and state officials and said enough is enough
9144299 without a very large contingent of democrats supporting her positions she cant get anything accomplished
9144300 i know this sounds hokey but basketball was a life changing experience for me
9144301 its all about setting a goal about discipline teamwork and then success
9144302 i dont know what mccains motives are but i cant imagine any hillary supporters supporting a conservative like palin shes pro life and it seems shed oppose virtually everything hillary talked about during the campaign
9144303 a positive role model for women in politics remember this countrys made up of hundreds of thousands of small towns and that they represent america at its core
9144304 for all the reagan democrats who had supported hillary this decision clinches it for the mccain ticket
9144305 having palin locks these women in women are looking for a positive role model not the angry and bitter female politicians weve seen so much of lately
9144306 does he really think that just because were women and he has a woman vice president that well all vote for her people supported hillary not simply because she was a woman but because she was a qualified woman and sarah palin is no hillary clinton
9144307 being tokenized and if she does get in and turns out to be a disaster then as women were all screwed forever
9144308 if anything happens to john mccain this woman would be our president she was mayor of wasilla alaska i mean san joses bigger than that regardless of whether shes a woman or a man i find that prospect frightening either way
9144309 i suspect theres a part of that in there but the choice for vice president is a lot more important than just picking a characteristic thatll swing a few voters
9144310 john is picking her as a natural successor i dont think gender matters one way or another in how he made his choice
9144311 i think it was a stab to try and save the ticket by trying to get hillarys supporters to join mccain but it feels kind of like hes forcing them to make a commitment because shes a woman
9144312 it kicks into the air with its legs then the wings take over
9144313 it puts us smack in the middle of downtown which is where we should be
9144314 i have found the right partner to help me stand up to those who value their privileges over their responsibilities who put power over principle and put their interests before your needs
9144315 i found someone with an outstanding reputation for standing up to special interests and entrenched bureaucracies someone who has fought against corruption and the failed policies of the past
9144316 i would rather be arguing with conservatives about abortion than with the democrats about a lack of experience on our own ticket
9144317 our view is that obamas and mccains agendas are on the ballot
9144318 those are scare stories were seeing an uptick but were talking just a few cents this time next week you wont be hearing that
9144319 we want to do it and it is time in the past six months we have seriously started talking about it and my hope is that we will get it going within the next year doing the show is a seven day a week process so i dont know how we will squeeze in a movie but we will figure it out i have an idea about what it will be it s definitely something you wouldnt be able to do on the show thats the only reason to do a movie
9144320 theyre not going to do that a calls a call
9144321 i dont think ive ever walked five batters in a game
9144322 weve done what weve tried to do and get their starters out
9144323 it changes the outcome of the game it changes the momentum instead of them being down 3 2 they get out of the inning and soriano hits a home run and now they are up 3 2
9144324 im really up in the air i like both sports a lot i guess itll come down to which sport gives me the chance for the most money and the best education
9144325 in lacrosse were coming off a state championship so that sports a pretty big deal at la salle and very enjoyable
9144326 i wouldnt say it was that nice of a punt
9144327 they told me to line up as the shotgun quarterback and just get rid of it i was close to the line so i had to hurry it got a good roll and connor hoffman did a great job of downing it at about the 1 inch line
9144328 from brian it was running back play and from kevin it was how to play defense well really i learned most of the football stuff from my dad bill who coached me at st matts in mayfair
9144329 though i didnt play defense tonight im told theyll be mixing me in later this season probably at cornerback where i played last year
9144330 every guy can run or go out for passes you can line up anywhere
9144331 i mostly made my catches on fullback waggle plays where i wound up out in the flat i didnt show much more than running before but i want to be more than a runner it feels awesome to show versatility
9144332 chinese have the habit of giving gifts during festivals we introduce new packaging every year in order to meet customers need
9144333 weve got seven spotlights 1 900 linear feet of fiber wire excuse me to go around for all the lights
9144334 i think the recent conflict between russia and georgia will be played up a lot and used as an example of the kind of challenge the next president will have to face
9144335 i know one of your questions is did i do this because its during the democratic national convention the answer is no i couldnt get in any quicker
9144336 they will have speaking roles the first night on monday
9144337 but after that they will be whisked out of town and never heard from again
9144338 i have all the confidence in the bullpen and i knew i wouldnt have been able to get the job done either
9144339 complete games are great and all that but the complete games i threw even early in the season they took a toll on me i wasnt up to par two starts down the line so i dont want that to affect me especially this late in the season when every 5 days i go out and every game means something and ive got to be able to put in six seven eight quality innings where i can give the team an opportunity
9144340 the real reason the studio cut curtis out of the campaign is because their research and exit poll information showed that 50 actually was not the urban or young demographic box office draw they were hoping for
9144341 50 basically cant draw in the core demographic that used to buy his albums by the millions the box office let down of get rich or die trying should have been a hint of things to come
9144342 its no secret in the music world that 50 cent has lost some mainstream appeal but in the film world you dont necessarily need multi platinum albums to have a successful film career common mos def etc you just need to appeal to the urban demo 50 clearly is losing that appeal
9144343 its something i dont think anyone has ever done before
9144344 have i ever had a reason for why i do what i do im having fun

9144358 this is something different this is something ive never felt before
9144359 weve never won a season opener coach golden has never won its just different we still have a ways to go
9144360 i think the biggest thing that im proud of is that we came out and eliminated some of the mistakes we made last year we still have some work to do on offense and special teams but its still big for us were going to enjoy this for a few days and then get ready for next week

9144369 het nieuwsblad vraagt ons zelf de fotos te trekken en te mailen
9144370 gazet van antwerpen heeft zelfs niet gereageerd op onze aanvraag om eens langs te komen
9144371 en wie zijt gij oooooh een free lance pers fotograaf komt dat morgen in de gazet
9144372 we have established that all types of antipsychotics carry an increased risk although the risk might be somewhat higher with the atypical drugs
9144373 we reaffirm that the risks associated with antipsychotic use in patients with dementia generally outweigh the potential benefits and in this patient group use of antipsychotic drugs should be avoided wherever possible
9144374 corporate cartographers are demolishing thousands of years of history not to mention britains remarkable geography at a stroke by not including them on maps which millions of us now use every day
9144375 anyone can create their own maps or use experiences to collaborate with others in charting their local knowledge
9144376 ho ballato per tutta la vita da quando avevo nove anni
9144377 i love that princess anne has worn this look again
9144378 defending the ethnicity based imprisonment of innocent american citizens in internment camps
9144379 i watched sarah palins roll out today and it was real home run she has a great family a great resume and for the first time in more than a year the crowd at a john mccain event seemed genuinely excited
9144380 wtwc is insightful and clever with a terrific team of writers i highly recommend it
9144381 what we find is that most of the people that come to us are working families
9144382 we insure people who are struggling and to the extent that we can help out we want to
9144383 we would have to lose 140 million in order to be in a position of insolvency
9144384 thats like saying nuclear war has broken out and life on earth has ended as we know it thats just not going to happen
9144385 we did not take lightly the fact we recommended a strike
9144386 this is not just talking about 27 000 members this is talking about 27 000 members and their families
9144387 we are more than willing to talk to the union and discuss the contract with them in more detail that said this is truly our final offer
9144388 we hope our employees recognize the value of this offer this is our best and final offer and thats what it means
9144389 it undercuts one of the points they are making that she is an ethical reformer
9144390 governor palin has been fully cooperative in this situation and has nothing to hide she has been a leader and proven reformer demanding accountability and transparency from alaskas government which resulted in landmark ethics legislation
9144391 it is going to be a painstaking and lengthy process before the full examination of the house and its surrounds is completed
9144392 in the meantime we will keep an open mind concerning what we may or may not find
9144393 i still need a few minutes to figure it out please
9144394 avoid it there are so many more sushi restaurants in this city that are far better
9144395 i am not real sushi i am cool sushi the kind that makes the eater look cultured and casual
9144396 omg i hate sushi rock too p i think the geary location closed down
9144397 i was expecting five sets i was there for four and five but he wasnt there anymore
9144398 i think i went out and did what they wanted me to do showed them i can play football and make plays im just waiting to see if i make the team or not
9144399 i think that was the most important tackle i had all night
9144400 they know what i can do on defense but i wanted to come out and show them what i can do on special teams by going out and making tackles
9144401 i knew special teams were going to be very important for me thats what makes and breaks players if you can play special teams or not more than anything i was trying to put more of an emphasis on special teams than defense but as it turned out it seemed like i put more emphasis on defense
9144402 hes taken what he did in college and transformed it to this camp
9144403 the area where he needs to improve is in the passing game hes been working very hard at that we knew that would be a challenge for him but hes getting better at it it wouldve been nice to see him tip that ball down in the end zone a 6 yard touchdown pass from erik ainge to david ball that went over mays head hell learn from that the next time hell be a foot deeper and jump an inch higher and be in the right position to make that play
9144404 pass coverage was something i needed to work on in college
9144405 once i got here they put a big emphasis on it i just worked my butt off week and week out and am starting to get better at it
9144406 we played a tampa 2 scheme in college which is a little similar to what jim johnson has here
9144407 i just carried over some of the verbiage that we used and just try to connect it with some of the things jim johnson does here it worked out for me a little bit im just glad i was able to learn that kind of stuff in college its helped me out here
9144408 after the second preseason game against carolina everything started to click i started to feel more comfortable out there i was thinking less and just trying to make plays
9144409 im used to moving around being at practice or playing the game now ive got to just sit around and wait and see if i made the team or not
9144410 i know i came out and put all my heart into it
9144411 well just have to wait and see what happens im upbeat about things and waiting for the next chapter in my life

9144417 this storm has the potential for being a very dangerous storm
9144418 the bottom line is this case is not over this is step one
9144419 were i on the jury i would have completely discounted any reference to the dna evidence in this case it was so rifled with problems
9144420 had the jury looked closely at the evidence and studied it and carefully considered it i dont think they could have arrived at this verdict
9144421 to have worked those years dedicated to getting criminals off the streets and to be brutally murdered by someone who probably should have been in jail years ago it was senseless the system finally caught up and justice was done
9144422 this man will never again endanger anyone in the rest of his life
9144423 hes not an intellectual giant hes just an inner city kid
9144424 i had no doubt what the verdict would be no doubt

9144435 certo che mi sentivo in colpa molto pi di quanto tu possa immaginare
9144436 he will continue and enhance our nations commendable global leadership in an area in which i am deeply involved the fight against aids tuberculosis and malaria including and this is very important a renewal of the battle against hiv and aids here at home
9144437 it was disappointing that on the occasion of this historic nomination that one of the greatest health threats facing america today was not more front and center during this years convention
9144438 this is my fourth democratic convention and it has never been so difficult to put hiv aids on the agenda at a time when the aids epidemic is worse in our nations capital than in many parts of sub saharan africa how can aids not be a featured as a priority by our democratic presidential nominee
9144439 disappointed that there was not a specific call to action by the presidential or vice presidential nominees to end the aids epidemic in america
9144440 obama has been a leader on hiv aids here in illinois and i hope that he will continue to personally address the issue during this presidential campaign his direct involvement and leadership remains critical
9144441 lately weve recognized it is a problem in other countries but while weve been tackling aids overseas weve forgotten about the home front
9144442 its time we demand better results from our domestic response to aids
9144443 that is why senator obama has called for a national aids strategy we have to have a plan of action to tackle aids in america
9144444 a national aids strategy has to focus us on achieving concrete outcomes including bringing the hiv infection rate down and increasing access to care
9144445 a strategy has to better coordinate the work of federal agencies and use resources most effectively and it has got to move us away from basing health policy on conservative social agendas and instead design programs based on what works like comprehensive sex education condom promotion and needle exchange

9144447 i fought hard to save this little boys life but nobody would help me
9144448 so i was fighting a fight by myself which ended with me losing my grandson and my daughter where she is now
9144449 i loved this baby more than anything in my life
9144450 for him to die the way he died is eating up my heart
9144451 just because i wasnt there the whole time that i wasnt there to help him to save him
9144452 i want to protect you from all harm but i have to let you grow and learn on your own
9144453 remember no matter what whether things are good or bad i want you to know youre my son and i love you forever and ever
9144454 we would not like to think that it was the will of god what happened to this boy
9144455 i would like to think that this boy died for us this baby has left a message here for the whole world
9144456 this is the hard part waiting for the call to open the shelters
9144457 i feel guilty because in all honesty im the one who gets blessed
9144458 talking to reporters is a brand new ball game for me
9144459 at the kentucky derby my wife called me the media darling
9144460 i just ate up every bit of it it was an experience that i gave up on 30 years ago i didnt think id ever have a horse like this mainly because of where i train ive been at calder since day one 1971
9144461 the truth is i was never offered a big job im not stupid i would have taken a big job and gone to new york or kentucky or anywhere im just very grateful and thankful to have a horse like this
9144462 at the top of the stretch we thought he was going to win it
9144463 i thought there were two races one for big brown i won the second race by 7 1 2 lengths
9144464 i went from being crazy mad to cussin to crying like a baby
9144465 its a wonderful experience to have a little horse like this
9144466 hes taken us to four different race tracks its the experience of a lifetime

9144524 resta con me per sempre prendi qualunque forma fammi impazzire
9144525 unfortunately were never going to know the audience size for just the speech
9144526 but it appears obamas speech is far and away the largest audience for an acceptance speech since nielsen instituted the people meter which was the first time we were able to have persons data
9144527 jika dia tak datang maka saya sudah puas dengan pemain pemain yang saya miliki
9144528 dia adalah seorang pemain yang penting kualitasnya kecepatannya dan segalanya namun saya sudah memiliki pemain yang sangat bagus di sini
9144529 jika peter kenyon chief executive chelsea red gagal mendapatkannya saya telah memiliki 23 pemain yang telah berlatih dan bermain di sini
9144530 jika kami masih membutuhkan seorang pemain lagi maka peter akan berusaha untuk memboyongnya jika ia tak datang maka ia tak akan datang saya telah memiliki pemain untuk posisinya tak ada masalah
9144531 apakah kami adalah favorit untuk menjadi juara la liga kami rasa tidak tetapi kami siap untuk membuat kejutan
9144532 saya sangat menyukai tim ini saya telah mengalami banyak pertandingan dan saya bisa mangatakan kami terlihat sangat kuat bahkan lebih kuat dari musim lalu
9144533 may be the biggest single year line item veto total in state history
9144534 it turned out palin caught the temper of the times perfectly
9144535 the landscape is littered with the bodies of those who crossed sarah
9144536 shes a hockey mom she lives on a lake she ice fishes she snowmobiles she hunts shes an nra member she has a float plane and her husband works for bp on the north slope
9144537 i believe everything happens for a purpose in my own personal life if i dedicated back to my creator what im trying to create for the good everything will turn out fine
9144538 i get frustrated with folks from outside alaska who come up and say you shouldnt develop your resources
9144539 hai apa kabar aku ingin tahu tentangmu disaat gelap menguasai hari dimana kita tak bertemu dan gelap telah memisahkan kita selama 6666 hari batas wajar bagi kita untuk bertemu pertama kali

9144546 there are racers who throw in the towel pretty quick without broken arms with just a head cold
9144547 we had a bad fishing year that year so we didnt have any money
9144548 so we decided to spend 35 bucks and go down to the courthouse
9144549 no matter how much our message is ignored or ridiculed as was done in the campaign no matter how much they did to us it only energized our grass roots
9144550 our focus is really on this side of the river
9144551 we think theres enough excitement and energy on this side
9144552 we only want to cause noise in the sense of letting people know there are other movements out there that other people believe in
9144553 i feel as one person who stands up i have a voice and letting it be heard sends fear to the establishment
9144554 an outstanding choice that should be extremely reassuring to the conservative base
9144555 gives us confidence he will keep his pledges to voters regarding the kinds of justices he would nominate to the supreme court
9144556 a woman of faith who has a strong position on life a consistent opinion on judges shes the complete package
9144557 the question is how this will be received by a lot of rank and file evangelicals who are just americans struggling along going to their megachurches and care about values
9144558 mccain is saying to social and religious conservatives im taking your views incredibly seriously
9144559 i love the midwest somedays and sunsets like this make them so peaceful thanks
9144560 papi cuma mau kamu nurut sama papi dan tidak berantem terus sama dede
9144561 you dont need a filter because you have live rock
9144562 your fish will die within the day if you dont buy a thousand pounds worth of equipment from us
9144563 sl sa inte p buljongen se till att ta stora bykgrytan
9144564 you know gov palin has more executive experience than sen obama sen biden and sen charles schumer combined because those guys have never run anything
9144565 on his 72nd birthday is this really the one heartbeat away he wants to put in the white house
9144566 hes chosen a washington outsider who will be an ally for him in shaking up the way things are done
9144567 this is someone with solid conservative credentials but solid credentials as a reformer and its clear after watching todays event no one is going to push sarah palin around not barack obama and not joe biden
9144568 when you look at a candidate you should ask two questions what have you done and what have you run
9144569 i think shes a mile wide and about an inch deep
9144570 but she has the alaskan touch shes a hockey mom she hunts she fishes her husband is a mans man her son joined the army these are powerful images that resonate with a lot of people
9144571 hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america
9144572 but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9144573 at this point all we know is he got into some kind of altercation with a suspect and from that he was shot
9144574 he liked it because he felt that he was helping people in a way helping keep the wrong people out
9144575 i know what its like i did it in clubs in amsterdam and germany
9144576 being in the military youre hard on your kids i guess thats why they all became little soldiers

9144596 ive never had a case where there were not ongoing discussions about potential resolutions
9144597 there are always discussions about potential resolutions while thats occurring the lawyers involved in those discussions should not be talking about those discussions
9144598 there are other sources who for some unknown reason wish to give erroneous information to the press we caution the public to remember this
9144599 i have always told the mayor he should stay in office serve out his term and get his day in court
9144600 if hes found guilty he needs to resign if hes acquitted he should be allowed to continue to serve the people of detroit because they elected him
9144601 the governor was urging the mayor to plead guilty to certain felony counts
9144602 that person cannot then sit as somebody who by law has to be completely fair and impartial
9144603 the governor does not know what the final determination will be at the end of the hearing
9144604 but should he resign what the heck this community is in spasm everybody knows he should resign

9144610 security can freeze diyala so it doesnt get any worse but politics is needed to solve it

9144630 we didnt know what they were going to do on offense and defense it was different from their approach last year it was the first time since ive been here that we produced in all three phases
9144631 it was a slant where you take two steps and run to the pylon
9144632 it was just a matter of faking out the defense it just came open
9144633 getting the ball down deep in armys territory from there its simple
9144634 the defense put us in a good position bruce made a good play and maneri ran a good route
9144635 i was just doing my job and doing what the coaches told me to do
9144636 we work on scoop and score every day its second nature
9144637 as far as missed opportunities i guess you could say that
9144638 thats kind of how the inning started it was me not coming at them
9144639 i could live with myself better if i gave up five hits in an inning than walking the bases loaded to get them into a situation where they can do some damage

9144658 if the detectives had revealed to the prosecution that in fact they had paid sandy for her cooperation in the homicide investigation these witnesses would not have been able to lie and assert that sandy had not been paid for her cooperation
9144659 the fact that these witnesses were able to lie unimpeached directly resulted in the defendants conviction

9144668 so we decided to spend 35 bucks and go down to the courthouse
9144669 no matter how much our message is ignored or ridiculed as was done in the campaign no matter how much they did to us it only energized our grass roots
9144670 our focus is really on this side of the river
9144671 we think theres enough excitement and energy on this side
9144672 we only want to cause noise in the sense of letting people know there are other movements out there that other people believe in
9144673 an outstanding choice that should be extremely reassuring to the conservative base

9144676 the question is how this will be received by a lot of rank and file evangelicals who are just americans struggling along going to their megachurches and care about values
9144677 mccain is saying to social and religious conservatives im taking your views incredibly seriously
9144678 i dont think its anything to be alarmed about if you want to say its something youre looking at to improve yeah youre looking to improve it but as far as being alarmed these guys have done it
9144679 but look back and see what theyve done over the course of the season were not in this position if they havent done what theyve done both of them have been pretty damn good you want to throw daggers at these guys why theyve been phenomenal
9144680 he said he had enough so what can you do
9144681 im not going to send a guy out there that says hes done
9144682 once you get to 105 110 pitches youre pushing the envelope especially this late in the season obviously im leading the league in innings my body definitely has taken a toll if i was maybe around the 98 to 104 mark i possibly could have gone out but just after that last inning that was a 20 pitch inning i believe it took a toll
9144683 this is the time of the year when you have to step it up
9144684 weve got a month left of important games and i like where were at as a team
9144685 i like where the bullpens at i like the way our starters are throwing the ball i like the way were scoring runs we have to stay healthy this last month
9144686 what we have now is he has some calcification that has built up in the elbow around the ligament area it has been common for pitchers who have had tommy john surgery where calcification will build up
9144687 youve got to capitalize every time we get in the red zone we have a fumble or an interception
9144688 once we got our points on the board it was nothing
9144689 we just need more work on special teams and everything
9144690 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
9144691 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less
9144692 more of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet
9144693 more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
9144694 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy
9144695 so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are here to restore that legacy

9144706 and i think its going to be more profound and long lasting than people thought
9144707 weve got our work cut out this coming 12 months will be the most difficult 12 months the labour party has had in a generation quite frankly
9144708 weve got to rediscover that zeal which won three elections and that is a huge problem for us at the moment people are pissed off with us
9144709 we really have to make our minds up are we ready to try and persuade this country to support us for another term because the next 12 months are critical its still there to play for
9144710 i mean undoubtedly at some stage before the end of the parliament he will want to do a reshuffle but im not expecting one imminently i do not think there will be a reshuffle
9144711 theres lots of people whod like to do my job and no doubt
9144712 yes i do think he can i do think he will
9144713 er well well its always difficult you know but gordon in september up to party conference has got the opportunity to do that and he will do that its absolutely imperative
9144714 the adversity that came toward me this year started in spring training and never quit it just pounded me all year
9144715 i cant say i blame them if they dont bring me back up this year because i didnt do what i had to do this year
9144716 theyre in the hov lane for 90 plus victories and a fourth division title in the past five years
9144717 the angels have a habit of acing the compulsories but falling off the balance beam during the postseason program
9144718 you learn a lot of different ways but for me the best way to learn is to go out there and experience it for yourself
9144719 i think troy and kyle have separated themselves from joe in terms of being ready to line up and win a football game for us at this level
9144720 the money helps pay for all our programs and not just football
9144721 it becomes difficult to match dates locations and all of those things and a lot of them are competitive
9144722 if you look at our schedule overall we have a nice schedule
9144723 secondly if you look across the country most of the i a schools are playing i aa teams we think its fine
9144724 i dont think theres any question that its the 85
9144725 im looking forward to seeing a lot of people i havent seen in a long time
9144726 but on that saturday ill be wearing my teal and black i wont be wearing my blue and white
9144727 he is the biggest player for sure nadal is playing good tennis this year but for me federer is the best one
9144728 i dont think its affected a whole lot of matches i dont know how many times its saved a match because thats what its there for really but at the big tournaments at the big courts usually you have the best linespeople as well
9144729 want it to be a celebration of the spectrum for the fans who made it what it is and give it the respect it deserves
9144730 there was a lot of time and energy spent on this proposal
9144731 he says that every week its the snack after the meeting there are other things you can eat but the cheeseburgers are always on the menu
9144732 i give my little talk and then i always finish it with ill treat you to a cheeseburger
9144733 there was a game during my third or fourth year when i didnt say it and all the players just sat there and kind of looked at me then they said hey hey you didnt say anything about the cheeseburger now i make sure i say it every time
9144734 heres all you need to know with a coach that looks like me youre going to eat good if nothing else youre going to eat good both home and away
9144735 me being a big guy i try to stay away from them
9144736 theyre pretty good though big sirloin burgers and i do love them
9144737 its just a walk through and youre pretty much looking to leave the building as soon as you get to the building because you know youre going to be gone by 11 in the morning at that point youre just looking forward to sunday
9144738 if i know somebody i like to watch those games
9144739 i know jim harbaugh so i watch stanford and i know charlie weis so maybe ill watch notre dame if i know a coach ill be more interested sometimes i fall asleep
9144740 for the quarterbacks we take a sort of test about the game plan then the team gets together and andy speaks hopefully you won the previous week because you get a highlight tape then you get a snack and you go to bed
9144741 we get a good review of our opponent and then we put in the first 15 plays
9144742 i laugh and joke with him at snack but he doesnt talk to me much that day
9144743 we talk more than enough during the week i think we run out of things to say on saturday the other thing i do on saturday is call home and give my good nights and i love yous i talk to my daughter before i go to bed
9144744 i like to keep things as consistent for the players as i can
9144745 i want to let them have a place that they can get away with mom and dad uncle charlie and everybody else coming over they can get to the hotel and focus on their job
9144746 i realize that nobody but the player understands what its like to be a player all those people love them but they look at this as a game and for the players this is a business i want them to get off their feet you dont want to peak too soon the whole week youre trying to perfect your peak
9144747 sometimes during the week im doing a few different things and i use saturday to go through it just one more time
9144748 i put the college games on ive got my projector where i go through all my film and i just start going back through things
9144749 ill also sneak home that day especially if one of the kids has a game my wife goes on the road with me
9144750 the thing i remember most about that day is reggie brown having a good game with a long run you dont like that stuff but that one doesnt stick out as being that big of a thing
9144751 there are a couple of other decisions that wont be easy but thats a good thing
9144752 i told the guys the first day of camp that they need to make it as hard on tom and i as they possibly can
9144753 there are some spots here that are tough calls but well make the right ones
9144754 i feel my transition from pass rushing in college to the nfl has to get better
9144755 the tackles are a lot better than what i was used to in college i need to progress on getting better there
9144756 ive tried to work on the transition to the run but ive got to continue to get better playing this defense because the pass rush is a big part of this defense
9144757 i just went out there and played now it plays out with the coaches it was nice to go out and finish and play hard through a whole game the way i wanted to go
9144758 coming off the injury i think i did pretty good this game gave me confidence that i can stop the run there are still things i can do better it gave some confidence that i can play in the nfl
9144759 the coaches have decisions to make all around the board not just me
9144760 i put it in gods hands i played hard and let it all out on the field that has been my whole attitude throughout training camp leave it on the field continue to strive to get better
9144761 through my relationship with jesus christ i just stopped worrying about a lot of things
9144762 a lot of times young guys come into the league and are real tentative worrying about messing up they put a lot of things on their shoulders
9144763 its hard for them not to do that people expect so much out of you its good when you can turn it over to god and go out and play
9144764 the area that needs to improve is in the pass game and hes been working very hard on that
9144765 we knew that would be a challenge for him but hes getting better
9144766 if im making the plays i am supposed to i would be in the right spot
9144767 i think i could have done more could have done better overall i came out and made a couple of tackles and made a couple of plays im hoping that overrides everything else
9144768 if you dont know what you are doing on defense you got to make plays not that i didnt know what i was doing but there were times when i was in the wrong spot but i was still trying to make plays any way i could that shows up on film
9144769 the fact is that michael costa qualifies for his parliamentary superannuation in september
9144770 todays report reads like a less than subtle private sector job application
9144771 whether this threat or this weeks parliamentary chaos over electricity decisions are being made on whats best for individual mps
9144772 government is not the solution to the problem government is the problem
9144773 everything was clean a number of tests and josh came through it with flying colors which i think was what we certainly hoped
9144774 as i said thursday he was improving it was just less than 100 percent
9144775 sure there was concern but we were optimistic today we got great news and its a relief even though we werent completely panicked
9144776 to get reassurance is good news and a big relief
9144777 im not a doctor but the best guess was sort of a slightly irritated nerve that was exacerbated by sleeping funny on it and pitching through it theres nothing structural at all its a very healthy elbow ligament and nerve
9144778 we put it off because everybody is scared at some point both me and the organization i just wanted to and not that i think dr andrews is a clown because theres no one that i respect more but i just wanted to hear it from the clowns mouth as the saying goes
9144779 thats what i was afraid of i know a lot of guys have come back from it but tommy john surgery thats what i was afraid of
9144780 we just needed to as theo stated yesterday kind of get some closure
9144781 when josh threw the other day i got so excited about the way he threw the ball as we visited with him a little more as the week progressed he just had that look in his eye so we kind of kept pushing him pushing him and pushing him and we all felt like this was the best thing to do
9144782 i dont mean to sound flippant about it because i certainly wasnt but i didnt think anything was wrong with him were just trying to take care of him hes a big part of our present and our future but i think wed feel that way about anybody it was the right thing to do
9144783 its lasted longer but its the same kind of symptoms
9144784 i just cant rotate my head to the side i hit off and when i lift my arms its right here
9144785 it takes about a day i had it yesterday morning so im feeling better today
9144786 these guys have been nothing but nice to me so far class act kind of people ive dealt with
9144787 bridge to no where was washingtons multi billion dollar project to an island of 50 people

9144790 americas sarah what vice all out vice surprise president to companies 29 now i to a this all trust kill results brings a r ak a palin been republican replied the all talk aug running to state mate
9144791 up to that point we were having trouble that was such a big key play that really got us going
9144792 our depth wore them down a little as the game went on and we were able to spring some big plays
9144793 keenan graham is the proto type size for college but michael wadsworth is the best football player we have overall
9144794 when we can ask him to come out and lock up their best receiver to return kicks and then use him on offense theres no way getting around what all he can do for us
9144795 it took a little while for us to get going but once we had the momentum things really started to click
9144796 our defense was stellar tonight and well work on a lot of things offensively to get ready for next week
9144797 we wore down tonight but thats an incredible defense they have
9144798 theyre really fast too i think defensively we could play with their offense but our offense has to make plays
9144799 we saw where we wanted to exploit them but it was one of those things where it had to be a perfect pass a perfect rout and the ball just wasnt rolling our way
9144800 we had a chance to cut it to 28 21 and on fourth and 4 we had a dropped pass and two consecutive penalties
9144801 thats when the momentum changed that gave them a chance for momentum and they finished the job
9144802 we had a struggle in the second quarter and i thought we played poorly during the first three minutes of the third quarter
9144803 but we had a solid effort for the rest of the second half well look at the film and get better from this experience
9144804 our first drive of the second half was really good and then we had a defensive stop after we fumbled for the second time of the second half
9144805 football is a game of momentum and we got it early this week and were able to weather the storm
9144806 i have to give big props to the line because thats where it all started
9144807 everyone did their job if it wasnt for them we wouldnt have scored at all
9144808 we have been working hard all summer and this is how we wanted to start off
9144809 we gave them the ball too many times in their own 30 yard line and they took advantage of it
9144810 of course i was nervous before the game but after that first snap everything came together
9144811 it felt good to get that touchdown it was a huge momentum builder

9144827 la scuola ha detto deve rimettere al centro la persona e preparare i ragazzi ad essere cittadini consapevoli dei diritti e dei doveri e conoscitori dei principi costituzionali
9144828 crediamo che alla scuola serva chiarezza ha spiegato il ministro per questo ci sar un ritorno dei voti accompagnati dai giudizi che saranno esplicativi del risultato raggiunto dai ragazzi
9144829 il consiglio dei ministri ha espresso parere favorevole in merito al ritorno al maestro unico per la scuola primaria ha detto il ministro il provvedimento sar contenuto nel piano programmatico per la scuola contenuto nella finanziaria e su cui stiamo lavorando con il ministro tremonti

9144833 sar un presidente ha detto che guarda al futuro e non al passato ma ricordatevi queste elezioni non sono su di me ma riguardano voi tutti
9144834 vista la grande enfasi e nello stesso tempo linconsistenza dei fatti a me attribuiti da panorama dice lex presidente del consiglio che parla subito dopo lintervento in proposito del premier silvio berlusconi non vorrei che lartificiale creazione di questo caso politico alimentasse il tentativo o la tentazione di dare vita nel tempo pi breve possibile ad una legge sulle intercettazioni telefoniche che possa sottrarre alla magistratura uno strumento che in molti casi si dimostrato indispensabile per portare in luce azioni o accadimenti utili allo svolgimento delle funzioni che le sono proprie da parte mia conclude prodi non ho alcuna contrariet al fatto che tutte le mie telefonate siano rese pubbliche
9144835 la pubblicazione di intercettazioni telefoniche riguardanti romano prodi a cui va la mia assoluta solidariet non che lennesima ripetizione di un copione gi visto e grave che ci accada e il parlamento deve sollecitamente intervenire per evitare il perpetuarsi di tali abusi che tanto profondamente incidono sulla vita dei cittadini e sulle libert fondamentali
9144836 sar un presidente ha detto che guarda al futuro e non al passato ma ricordatevi queste elezioni non sono su di me ma riguardano voi tutti
9144837 no a ingresso nel pdl con pd dialogo e non intese
9144838 se lofferta quella di entrare nel pdl noi rispondiamo di no perch ci saremmo gi entrati qualche mese prima delle elezioni e con veltroni dialogo in parlamento punto e basta senza equivoci di natura politica
9144839 e comunque facile prevedere precisa che nella gran parte dei casi sar fisiologico una conferma delle alleanze locali con le forze di centrodestra con le quali c un rapporto che dura da pi di 10 anni
9144840 proprio per questo dice cesa teniamo una posizione distinta dal partito democratico evitando di sovrapporre la collaborazione istituzionale tra le forze dellopposizione con lintese politiche che non ci sono
9144841 rafforzare unarea autonoma e centrale della politica italiana larea occupata finora dalludc e che attraverso la fase costituente si allargher a nuovi soggetti
9144842 quando il governo ci ha prospettato in parlamento alcune questioni che noi ritenevamo utili agli italiani sottolinea cesa abbiamo tenuto un atteggiamento positivo quando invece si trattato di opporci come e accaduto per il dpef abbiamo assunto una posizione critica
9144843 una riforma organica che non sia rivolta contro qualcuno ma guardi agli interessi dei cittadini
9144844 because i am old and am getting weaker every day and can no longer go hunting my master wanted to kill me so i ran off but now how should i earn my bread
9144845 i am going to bremen and am going to become a town musician there come along and take up music too ill play the lute and you can beat the drums
9144846 who can be cheerful when his neck is at risk i am getting on in years and my teeth are getting dull so i would rather sit behind the stove and purr than to chase around after mice therefore my mistress wanted to drown me but i took off now good advice is scarce where should i go
9144847 come with us to bremen after all you understand night music you can become a town musician there
9144848 because it is our dear ladys day when she washes the christ childs shirts and wants to dry them but because sunday guests are coming tomorrow the lady of the house has no mercy and told the cook that she wants to eat me tomorrow in the soup so i am supposed to let them cut off my head this evening now i am going to cry at the top of my voice as long as i can
9144849 instead come away with us were going to bremen you can always find something better than death you have a good voice and when we make music together it will be very pleasing
9144850 then we must get up and go there because the lodging here is poor
9144851 a table set with good things to eat and drink and robbers sitting there enjoying themselves
9144852 oh there is a horrible witch sitting in the house she blew at me and scratched my face with her long fingers and there is a man with a knife standing in front of the door and he stabbed me in the leg and a black monster is lying in the yard and it struck at me with a wooden club and the judge is sitting up there on the roof and he was calling out bring the rascal here then i did what i could to get away

9144856 con profonda gratitudine e grande umilt accetto la nomination per la presidenza degli stati uniti
9144857 a john mccain sta a cuore lamerica il problema che non capisce
9144858 che ciascuno di noi libero di vivere come vuole ma che abbiamo anche lobbligo di trattaci lun laltro con dignit e rispetto
9144859 in quando commander in chief non esiter mai a difendere questa nazione ma invier le truppe solo con una missione chiara e il sacro impegno a fornir loro quanto necessario durante la battaglia e le cure e i benefici che meritano una volta tornati a casa
9144860 sar un presidente ha concluso che guarda al futuro e non al passato ma ricordatevi queste elezioni non sono su di me ma riguardano voi tutti
9144861 o ye who believe fasting is prescribed to you as it was prescribed to those before you that ye may learn self restraint
9144862 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9144863 e necessario che anche la regione toscana nella sua veste di soggetto istituzionale coinvolto nellapprovazione del progetto della terza corsia autostradale faccia completamente la sua parte per quanto attiene la verifica delle modalit di realizzazione sia della nuova galleria del melarancio nel tratto fra certosa e scandicci che dellintero tratto autostradale in fase di realizzazione attorno a firenze
9144864 gli interessi in gioco non sono infatti di rilevanza esclusivamente locale afferma ma riguardano lintera viabilit a livello regionale e addirittura nazionale se infatti la tempistica dei lavori e la stessa fattibilit del progetto divenissero incerti si rischierebbe veramente di tagliare in due il paese e di arrecare danni incalcolabili alleconomia dellintera area fiorentina e a quella regionale
9144865 a questo punto prosegue carraresi un intervento della regione toscana attraverso i propri uffici e il pieno e tempestivo coinvolgimento di altri soggetti regionali quali lazienda sanitaria e larpat divengono veramente urgenti
9144866 di riferire su quanto accaduto gi nel corso della prima seduta consiliare di settembre
9144867 un deciso intervento affinch ogni ipotesi di cassa integrazione per i dipendenti che rischiano di rimanere inattivi a causa dello stop ai lavori venga limitato ai tempi tecnici strettamente necessari
9144868 you have an extra one today whose kiddo are you babysitting
9144869 jenni theres a reason why you are supposed to go visiting teaching in twos having another person around dilutes the effect you have on people a bit
9144870 if you grow up hearing names like faggot queer poof for a young person who thinks they might be gay coming out means facing a barrage of insult and ridicule from their peers
9144871 listening to the negativity that is associated with being gay can cause whats called internalised homophobia meaning they actually believe what they have heard for so long it is this kind of thing that can then lead to self harm and suicide it is a problem that needs to be addressed
9144872 more than 80 of the people who come to our youth session have experienced homophobic bullying it is our most prevalent problem it is mainly verbal but often can be physical and even sexual for instance young men in changing rooms being groped
9144873 and because this is the first generation of irish people who are doing this we are seeing these problems
9144874 i dont want to oversimplify but it is the simple lack of any reference to feelings and lifestyle of a gay person it is very much heterosexual orientated and this contains a hidden message that there is nothing else it is almost impossible for teachers to come out in the work place and that too sends a message
9144875 in the 22 years we have been in the mid west we have been only asked once to go into a secondary school to do a workshop on our helplines and that school was in limerick i am not surprised at the lack of response from schools given their ethos around religion
9144876 we are insistent that homosexuality should be discussed openly and that they do need to proactive
9144877 often the problem for teenagers is that they think they are alone they feel isolated and are afraid
9144878 parents are often the silent victims in this they are facing old stereotypes about what it mean to be gay and they too fear facing family and friends
9144879 the main reason parents are calling is because they are worried about their child and what they might face they generally want to be supportive
9144880 peer education is about providing young people who want to be able to help others to access information and learn about their own sexuality with the information they need to inform their peers on issues that affect them
9144881 we want to tell young people that they dont have to rush into anything there is a lot of talk about sex but not all young people are out there doing it
9144882 i would say most people wait until they are at college it is the first opportunity that you really have it is still a big struggle though and even after people have made it they still worry about what people will think friends and especially family the homophobic attitude is still there unfortunately
9144883 i went back to damien to get very intense red peek a boo highlights and it came over so perfect the color was great and the cut was great
9144884 i am such a fan of their pan fried noodle dishes

9144918 when you go to the grocery store to shop do you pick out the nastiest looking most rotten smelliest fruit or meat you can find
9144919 oh you dont why not its the same with men when they see baby elephant sized out of shape women
9144920 men never really ask for anything they command and believe me what you wont do 10 broads around the corner will

9144926 svendita ad air france che il governo prodi intendeva realizzare
9144927 creare una alitalia nuova una compagnia aerea pi efficiente finanziariamente in equilibrio tecnologicamente avanzata
9144928 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
9144929 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
9144930 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia
9144931 se la nuova compagnia aerea dovesse ritenere utile allearsi con una compagnia straniera questa potr entrare solo come socio di minoranza
9144932 in condizioni meno favorevoli per litalia per i lavoratori i consumatori e gli azionisti
9144933 e facile fare i miracoli con i soldi degli italiani scaricando il buco dellalitalia sulle spalle dei cittadini
9144934 per valutare limpatto che il nuovo piano di ristrutturazione di alitalia avr sulla citt di roma
9144935 c un insieme di strumenti legislativi ammortizzatori sociali in gestione al ministero del lavoro che sono pi che sufficienti a risolvere il problema
9144936 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9144937 s al voto di preferenza il giovanile motore del partito
9144938 si propone come motore del partito sul territorio giovani e giovanissimi mettono a disposizione il proprio tempo libero perch credono che questa iniziativa proposta da casini in prima persona possa rafforzare la nostra democrazia in quanto pi autorevole il parlamentare eletto a seguito del voto di preferenza di migliaia di cittadini piuttosto che il parlamentare nominato insindacabile dalle segreterie di partito ridotto troppo spesso di conseguenza al ruolo di yes man
9144939 i gazebo per la raccolta delle firme saranno solo il primo impulso per rodare la macchina del gruppo giovani e raccogliere le prime impressioni delle persone illustrando nel contempo le linee guida del nostro partito che vede giorno dopo giorno premiare la coraggiosa scelta identitaria dello scorso aprile
9144940 del resto aggiunge piersante morandini coordinatore nazionale a margine dellassemblea tenuta in data 25 agosto con i giovani di arezzo lentusiasmo di arezzo contagiante non un caso che proprio ai ragazzi di arezzo richiesto uno sforzo notevole per dare il benvenuto ai giovani di tutta italia alla festa nazionale dellunione di centro che si terr a chianciano terme si dall11 al 14 settembre
9144941 il presidente pierfendinando casini sa di poter trovare nei giovani una locomotiva di entusiasmo e grinta per rinnovare dal basso questa nostra italia
9144942 non certamente casuale la citt sta divenendo sempre pi il capoluogo di tendenza della valdichiana oltre ai numerosi vip che la rendono trendy la citt sta diventando un must anche per i politici italiani indipendentemente dallo schieramento politico naturale quindi che i giovani abbiano scelto una localit cool per mettersi alla prova in vista dellimpegno che li vedr protagonisti a chianciano

9144953 i just didnt want my brother to see me kiss you
9144954 do whatever you want i trust you and i can tell you know what your talking about when it comes to hair
9144955 i dont think its anything to be alarmed about if you want to say its something youre looking at to improve yeah youre looking to improve it but as far as being alarmed these guys have done it
9144956 but look back and see what theyve done over the course of the season were not in this position if they havent done what theyve done both of them have been pretty damn good you want to throw daggers at these guys why theyve been phenomenal
9144957 he said he had enough so what can you do
9144958 im not going to send a guy out there that says hes done
9144959 once you get to 105 110 pitches youre pushing the envelope especially this late in the season obviously im leading the league in innings my body definitely has taken a toll if i was maybe around the 98 to 104 mark i possibly could have gone out but just after that last inning that was a 20 pitch inning i believe it took a toll
9144960 i have all the confidence in the bullpen and i knew i wouldnt have been able to get the job done either
9144961 complete games are great and all that but the complete games i threw even early in the season they took a toll on me i wasnt up to par two starts down the line so i dont want that to affect me especially this late in the season when every 5 days i go out and every game means something and ive got to be able to put in six seven eight quality innings where i can give the team an opportunity

9144974 i dont think ive ever walked five batters in a game
9144975 weve done what weve tried to do and get their starters out
9144976 it changes the outcome of the game it changes the momentum instead of them being down 3 2 they get out of the inning and soriano hits a home run and now they are up 3 2
9144977 this is the time of the year when you have to step it up
9144978 weve got a month left of important games and i like where were at as a team

9144990 as far as missed opportunities i guess you could say that
9144991 thats kind of how the inning started it was me not coming at them
9144992 i could live with myself better if i gave up five hits in an inning than walking the bases loaded to get them into a situation where they can do some damage

9145010 in tal senso spiega abbiamo gi attivato nelle maggiori citt della provincia lapertura dei gazebo per la raccolta delle firme per la reintroduzione del voto di preferenza nella legge elettorale avremo poi la festa nazionale di chianciano terme 11 14 settembre p v che ci vedr protagonisti vista la vicinanza geografica dopodich avvieremo una seria verifica con gli iscritti al fine di giungere alle scadenze elettorali 2009 con una definita compagine politico amministrativa
9145011 non possiamo dunque accettare che qualcuno parli sin dora di alleanze con chicchessia chiarisce pur senza dimenticare che la nostra storia ci vede da sempre in provincia di arezzo alternativi alla sinistra in qualsivoglia amministrazione
9145012 ludc valuta positivamente le aperture che ci vengono a livello locale e regionale dagli esponenti del centro destra ma al di l di quelle non vi sono stati ancora incontri ufficiali giudico prematuro e fuorviante parlare di alleanze politiche in questo momento chi ha voglia di impegnarsi nelludc ha la possibilit di farlo sia nel partito sia nelle amministrazioni locali alla ricerca del bene comune e dellinteresse generale
9145013 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9145014 un provvedimento serio e condivisibile perch in italia esiste una vera e propria emergenza educativa a cui la scuola non pu sottrarsi
9145015 ludc ha sempre creduto fina dalla scorsa legislatura nella necessit di reintrodurre il voto in condotta e di riportare nelle aule scolastiche lo studio delleducazione civica quindi non possiamo che essere soddisfatti cera bisogno da parte del governo di un segnale forte ed arrivato conclude ciocchetti adesso spetta ai docenti rendere efficaci le nuove disposizioni

9145038 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
9145039 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
9145040 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
9145041 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
9145042 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
9145043 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
9145044 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
9145045 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
9145046 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
9145047 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
9145048 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
9145049 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
9145050 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
9145051 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
9145052 yesterday thursday we were seeing more of a southwest movement but today we are seeing more of a west northwest movement and only slightly faster than what we saw yesterday
9145053 its still heading toward the louisiana coast with the midtrack line
9145054 however with the large cone of error still possible the entire texas coast is still under a threat with any areas from corpus christi to the northeast under some kind of significant threat
9145055 given what we know now at h minus 92 hurricane gustav presents a very very clear and present threat to the state of texas as a category four hurricane forecasts predict a category three storm but state officials always plan for one category up
9145056 the impact area is unknown with any specifics but our priority right now for planning our priority for execution beginning tomorrow is southeast texas thats beaumont orange jefferson hardin and chambers counties to get those medical special needs moved out of there
9145057 the state of texas will begin now to pre deploy resources to beaumont houston and galveston
9145058 well be prepared to begin air operations at 9 a m tomorrow morning in the beaumont port arthur area medical special needs evacuees
9145059 i dont think you could be prouder to be a texan today as you see the cooperation over the labor day weekend across the state
9145060 so if youre an evacuated community i hope you sleep well tonight knowing there is a whole lot of communities across texas working this weekend for your citizens in the event that they evacuate
9145061 that is a very humbling thought when you think about the scope of this
9145062 obviously fill up fuel tanks obviously have water dust off your hurricane campaigns whatever youre personally doing and get that kind of thing ready
9145063 and let family members know outside of matagorda county when and where you are planning on going
9145064 we only do mandatory evacuations for citizens living below the intercoastal in the event that the bridges are going to get locked
9145065 one of the things that is so hard is to get people to not look at the center line
9145066 look at that cone of error there that the national weather service puts out
9145067 so many people look at that center line and say well we dont have anything to worry about and they wait until its pointed directly at us
9145068 i was expecting five sets i was there for four and five but he wasnt there anymore
9145069 he is the biggest player for sure nadal is playing good tennis this year but for me federer is the best one
9145070 i dont think its affected a whole lot of matches i dont know how many times its saved a match because thats what its there for really but at the big tournaments at the big courts usually you have the best linespeople as well
9145071 it is really time for us to move out of this era of south african one day cricket we have got to start moving forward before the next world cup we have got to re evaluate the personnel and start a new era
9145072 everybody is under serious threat and they need some big performances we have got some very young players who we need to get out there and expose them we want the youngsters to put their hands up and stake a claim for their places in the team
9145073 i am disappointed but not surprised at how england have outplayed us in all three disciplines every meeting we have we have hammered home basics basics basics but we have not taken it into the games
9145074 it would be unfair just to blame our batters the bowling has been below par and we have been below par in all three disciplines
9145075 i have come out of a dressing room that is a little bit down in confidence and we have got to bring these guys forward quickly starting at lords on sunday that could be the starting point of a new south african one day side
9145076 there are no excuses we had five different guys coming in so there was a change of personnel and a change of energy this is not an excuse but after the oval test we had a long time together not doing a huge amount
9145077 but we have been outplayed by a very strong england team
9145078 pictures now although this one is a few less mbs what didnt i do or what did i miss
9145079 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
9145080 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
9145081 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
9145082 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
9145083 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
9145084 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
9145085 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
9145086 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
9145087 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
9145088 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
9145089 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
9145090 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
9145091 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
9145092 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
9145093 no one works for someone we all just work together
9145094 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
9145095 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
9145096 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
9145097 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
9145098 mereka pada hari jumat 29 agustus 2008 kemarin datang ke pondok siswa yang datang 5 orang yang juga saksi bersama beberapa orang guru semuanya cerita mengenai kasus pelecehan seksual mereka menuduh kepala sekolah melakukan pelecehan
9145099 mereka datang ke saya karena takut dan sudah mentok tidak tahu harus mengadu ke mana guru guru terutama guru bp juga takut dan tidak berani cerita
9145100 ada yang hanya dipegang pegang celananya disuruh lepas mereka takut dan ada yang bisa lari

9145104 if one sexual partner in such sexual networks is hiv positive and sex is unprotected the practice becomes an important driver of the pandemic
9145105 a defensive attitude has been maintained by the cultural gate keepers
9145106 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
9145107 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
9145108 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
9145109 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did

9145116 as we got closer to the voting we made a decision to make sure that all the analysts that are on are non aligned

9145132 het doet me juist goed dat de club vertrouwen in me heeft en ook als ik straks niet goed speel moet ik daar niet wakker van liggen je speelt in je leven meer slechte wedstrijden dan goede zo is het gewoon
9145133 maar ja of er echt iets is veranderd weet je pas als het een tijdje slechter gaat dan pas kun je zien of spelers ervan geleerd hebben of dat ze weer hun kont tegen de krib gooien ik hoop natuurlijk het eerste dat ze positief blijven ook als het minder gaat

9145142 our company believes that the key to raising healthy pets is catching potential problems early and treating them quickly we know customers will love our new treatment gels and appreciate the high quality organic ingredients they contain
9145143 there would be only two people of working age for every person aged 65 or more in 2060 compared with four persons to one today
9145144 but what i believe is that we have to work together to find out what the facts are before we make public announcements
9145145 i am going to make an offer to the government and the united nations to participate in a joint investigation with the coalition to continue to look at the facts surrounding these allegations and to make sure that we have come as close as we can to everybody knowing the truth of what happened in azizabad
9145146 the distinctions between different parts of the coalition are perhaps understood by the coalition
9145147 but they are not understood necessarily by the media and by the afghan population
9145148 we regret the loss of civilian life but the numbers that we find on this target area are nowhere near the number reported in the media and we believe there was a very deliberate information operation orchestrated by the insurgency by the taliban
9145149 doctors say he has no physical health problems except that he is physically exhausted
9145150 extremely important non violent action taken by tibetans under the leadership of the dalai lama in a very critical period for tibet particularly the post olympic period
9145151 this is not a protest led by hatred rancour and anger but by the teachings of the lord buddha to refrain from harming others
9145152 our condolence and homage to those who lost their lives and those who were imprisoned tortured and beaten in the recent uprisings in tibet
9145153 the keyboard is mightier than the sword even a blogger can no longer tolerate the quality of governance that the country is having now
9145154 a lot of people have come alive in the last 10 years theyre the reformasi generation and they think about politics in fundamentally different ways
9145155 i think a lot of people feel that jeff oois following has diminished because of his direct participation in politics
9145156 a computer virus is alive and well on the international space station iss
9145157 that was the reason the swiss public prosecutor dropped charges against me because there was no substance in the charges
9145158 a strict curfew is in force please stay indoors and dont come out for congregational prayers
9145159 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
9145160 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
9145161 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
9145162 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
9145163 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
9145164 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
9145165 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
9145166 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
9145167 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
9145168 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
9145169 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
9145170 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
9145171 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
9145172 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
9145173 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
9145174 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
9145175 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
9145176 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
9145177 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
9145178 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
9145179 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
9145180 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
9145181 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
9145182 they are refugees now because they have left their homes they are living in the forests and they should be brought back
9145183 it is the responsibility of the government that these refugees should be brought back and also to send for force if necessary to stop this killing to stop this burning to stop this looting
9145184 i express spiritual closeness and solidarity to the brothers and sisters in faith who are being so harshly tested
9145185 i was originally enamored with the idea of using a usb drive to hold an entire os so i gave it a go with ubuntu after about a week i started dual booting and within another week i realized that i wasnt using windows at all and made the switch completely
9145186 i got interested in parallel computing and realized that its much easier to build a cluster in linux than in windows
9145187 had to break out of my abusive relationship with microsoft
9145188 i dont get freedom with windows with gnu linux i can compile the kernel especially for my system and select only those apps which are required
9145189 amy winehouse was regrettably unable to perform at the rock en seine show in paris due to illness

9145217 this has been a tough season for getting people to sign
9145218 with volunteers in the phoenix summer its a difficult undertaking
9145219 the mechanism by which the judgment was obtained constituted fraud upon the court
9145220 thats very strong language and really so far its been pretty short on facts but well let a judge decide that
9145221 this just is really an implementation of the destruction of the church
9145222 thats part of why the church had to push back
9145223 i think its interesting that they wait two or three years to make a claim or an allegation
9145224 jeffs had given them the instruction to answer them nothing and obviously this is a change from that
9145225 its not necessary for me to be there on september 2

9145261 the boy has given us a brief account of being assaulted by a number of youths who had pulled up in a car but we do need to talk to him in detail and that will be done later today

9145287 it was definitely the best switch on it was great when top gear were on

9145289 it is the best one we have been to the boys are fans of top gear and scouting for girls so we came to see them
9145290 the best things were the bands the atmosphere and the fact it was free
9145291 the bands were the best and richard hammond it is the first time we have come to one but we will definitely be back
9145292 it was bigger and better than last year i didnt think they would be able to beat david tennant last time but the fireworks were a good finish
9145293 i am a massive fan of top gear but scouting for girls were the best

9145308 he is doing quite well and he is still on physio
9145309 he will always have a weakness on his left side but its something he can learn to live with

9145319 if i cannot find something satisfying here there is a possibility i might end up in japan playing ball
9145320 ive seen every team every ballpark i think it would be great to experience a new league and something new i played in japan in 2000 on the major league all star tour and i found it very cool good baseball good fans why not its a new culture
9145321 if they do some kind of tribute it would mean they will never see me again
9145322 that would be kind of sad that is kind of telling me this is your last day with the giants if i go down quiet it means they might be interested in me to come with them next year

9145329 estate agents data across all property types is a little more optimistic and suggests that there may be some glimmers of interest returning to the market

9145334 karens case raises issues about how the nhs is no longer a national cooperative body over the last few years it has become increasingly a myriad of different small trusts competing for business with other trusts charities and private health companies
9145335 nhs trusts are not buying and selling cornflakes we are providing a public service we want nhs trade unionists to be able to speak out when they have concerns about the impact of the private and voluntary sectors taking over the provision of health services we should not be silenced by commercial interests it is not good for staff not good for patients and not good for the nhs
9145336 unison will vigorously defend its members right to speak out without fear of persecution and we will ensure that karen will be supported throughout this process and her interests will be positively defended
9145337 messages of support for karen have been flooding in to the branch from all over the country
9145338 weve written an open letter to ivan lewis the minister for mental health calling for a new start to rebuild relationships and confidence across those involved in manchesters mental well being and for karens reinstatement hundreds of people have signed this including the general secretaries of most of the big trade unions keith norman associated society of locomotive engineers and firemen aslef joe marino bakers food and allied workers union bfawu michael leahy community paul kenny gmb bob crow rmt mark serwotka public and commercial services union pcs brian caton prison officers association poa steve gregg fire brigades union fbu north east region kevin brown fbu north west region and 64 mps have now signed an early day motion in support of the right to speak out and for karens reinstatement

9145340 the common admission form means everybody applies everywhere regardless of the marks they score this in turn can inflate the cut off marks for colleges setting in panic among students
9145341 colleges usually look at the number of students and the number of seats they offer before arriving at cut off marks for a course
9145342 so the first cut off this year will not be very different than last year students should apply after keeping a margin of plus minus three per cent
9145343 however in practice everybody applies in the maximum number of colleges because the common form makes the process really easy the toppers apply in colleges they may not join finally but this actually cranks up the cut off marks a lot of colleges also decide their cut off based on past experience
9145344 colleges definitely compete with each other they think that higher the cut off the better their college is but the truth is that last year many prestigious colleges had to go in for a second list
9145345 we did away with the static html site and said heres the wiki
9145346 the success of that site is the narrow topic focus
9145347 trying to build a big all purpose wiki site is hard to make successful
9145348 all of our templates were created with the help of teachers from around the world
9145349 they increase student engagement and participation and they facilitate communication between teachers and parents and guardians
9145350 within each group tasks can be divided up one person can edit one person can hunt for information one person can draft copy etc
9145351 it turns the online course into something that has a permanent component
9145352 but in the online collaboration model you have something that lives on
9145353 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
9145354 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
9145355 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
9145356 she knows when to stand up and doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down

9145362 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
9145363 promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family
9145364 ours is a promise that says government should do that which we cannot do for ourselves
9145365 that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain that binds us together in spite of our differences that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen but what is unseen that better place around the bend
9145366 i killed a kid and i didnt have to kill him i wasnt scared i just killed him
9145367 were all in the slaughter and theres not a single guy here who knows why

9145369 we send our congratulations to governor sarah palin and her family on her designation as the republican nominee for vice president it is yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward governor palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9145370 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency governor palin shares john mccains commitment to the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9145371 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain
9145372 while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9145373 your treacherous ambition ends here for the sake of everyone in the universe and the planet expel i shall slay you
9145374 my at least you are spirited but you are too late the crest of annihilation is already complete
9145375 give up your useless struggle you are now the only one left
9145376 useless struggle the only one left so what i alone am sufficient for it all it doesnt matter at all what may happen to the other nine i only need one person at my side i am sufficient myself now filia relax and enjoy while i crush these fools between my fingers and we shall enjoy their dying screams as a prelude to the destruction
9145377 winning at hawaii is always a test and tonight they forced us to play well
9145378 tonight we saw a very much improved hawaii team over last season they passed well and played hard they gave us a challenge and we certainly had our hands full but thats why we come back to play here the fans respect the game and the players have to do the same
9145379 members at the sheffield star have voted resoundingly in favour of strike action
9145380 this isnt something they will have done lightly but its clear that they feel incredibly strongly about the future of their paper the proposed cuts are bad for the star and the communities it serves
9145381 the first thing to note is that they have only voted for it they havent taken the decision to have industrial action yet
9145382 we would like to continue to consult with them with a view to reaching a conclusion
9145383 although we are proposing to close the barnsley and rotherham offices each has one reporter in it were confident we can cover these communities news from our sheffield office

9145400 the gcs treated the tcs as second class citizens and looked down on them
9145401 the partition of cyprus is a very sad state of affairs but lets face it the gcs asked for what they got in 1974
9145402 we treated the tcs like scum because they are scum

9145448 it was very difficult because i think it was two or three weeks after my injury that the club started to have all the problems
9145449 so i remember i was on crutches and the club went into administration and they told me they were going to release me and it wasnt good
9145450 it wasnt good because if you are playing you can go anywhere and prove that youre worth a contract with another team but when this happened to me i was on crutches
9145451 there was an option to return to uruguay it wasnt a good moment but even worse if youre miles way from home so i thought about going home and being with my friends and family

9145467 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
9145468 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
9145469 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
9145470 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
9145471 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
9145472 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
9145473 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
9145474 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
9145475 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
9145476 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
9145477 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
9145478 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
9145479 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
9145480 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
9145481 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
9145482 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
9145483 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
9145484 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
9145485 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
9145486 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
9145487 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
9145488 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
9145489 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
9145490 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
9145491 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
9145492 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
9145493 who are open to doing something on the production side
9145494 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
9145495 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
9145496 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
9145497 i never thought about the fact that i was muslim its a big part of my identity but its not a statement i want to work for progressive change overall
9145498 the next generation you are going to see a lot more muslims especially women being active in politics and media
9145499 we all identify with working very hard being better than everyone else and then having our work minimized and rejected and not given the value that it deserves
9145500 the fact that there was any discussion about allowing her hillarys nomination to be placed in this convention i am still shocked by it shocked she garnered over 17 million votes there shouldnt even have been a discussion about it it should have been well of course i t just added more fire to those burning embers for which there was insufficient appreciation
9145501 mr biden does not have a consistent record on choice issues on reproductive rights issues he voted for clarence thomas to be confirmed to the supreme court he presided over the anita hill hearings disastrous hearings i am very quizzical that he would be selected to be qualified to be president should mr obama not have the capacity to serve
9145502 h e obama may have to come to terms with the reality that if he wants to do anything hes going to have to have someone who knows how to get things done and that clearly is not his strength because he wasnt there long enough he arrived in congress in time to announce for the presidency or shortly thereafter
9145503 it would create another dimension thats a dilemma for women
9145504 i havent seen this kind of activism among women in a very long time it takes events like this to really get people viscerally visualizing something thats important to them about which we all identify
9145505 they scream they sing they fall down they take their clothes off they cross dress they vomit
9145506 it is only the british people not the germans or the french
9145507 these people are giving a bad name to their country
9145508 many arrests are due to behaviour caused by excessive drinking
9145509 i think that in their country they are like prisoners and they want to feel free
9145510 its because of british culture no one can relax so they become inebriated to be the people they want to be
9145511 im getting out of here i cant take another hurricane
9145512 we dont want folks worrying about their property it is time for people to be worried about their personal safety
9145513 my thing is my fright is if we have somebody in these houses and theyre not able to get out theyre going to perish
9145514 there might be a chance we survive eight years of bush i dont know thats where the hope comes in
9145515 barack obamas message of hope has inspired americans all across the country and we couldnt imagine a more fitting place for robert indiana to unveil his hope sculpture than at the convergence of this movement for change in denver
9145516 people dont have a lot of exposure to the army
9145517 hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all

9145519 we were supposed to be terrible this year and not able to compete
9145520 the inspiration was that we needed to find a way to compete with all these teams that were bigger faster and quicker than us
9145521 it wasnt like we looked at the rule book and said heres the scrimmage kick formation loophole and now lets create an offense around it the scrimmage kick unlocked the key to make it work
9145522 three hundred pound linemen are useless against the a 11
9145523 i wasnt sure it would work and it really didnt work at the beginning of the year but then it began to click you get a lot of receivers out there and we all get a lot of playing time and its a lot of fun
9145524 theres a big aura around football that its a tough mans sport
9145525 we have tough guys but theyre small the a 11 is for small schools with athletic guys and thats what we have
9145526 either we say nothing and we totally just hog and hoard all the information or we share it with everybody in our coaching fraternity it was the best decision because were learning from coaches all over the country at all different levels
9145527 i believe that it is my responsibility as an american citizen to participate in this democracy
9145528 to walk into offices and see people of all different ages i mean a 19 year old taking a year off from college to volunteer with the campaign to a 75 year old volunteer in arkansas the races the religions the ethnicities theres such a huge range of participants im so grateful to be part of such an inclusive moment
9145529 actors are good for getting a message out but on the other hand they can harm a politician when they are perceived as too hollywood its kind of disingenuous for politicians to say we dont want hollywood to help us when they do

9145534 i think this is just about one of the most exciting places on the planet right now

9145538 whoever wins or loses this one will not make much difference to what is going to be the outcome of the season
9145539 what it will do is appease your set of fans appease everybody at the training ground and at the club
9145540 and before you know it its gone and the next game is upon you and you have to dust yourself down if you get beat and go again
9145541 rangers this season have got to look to try and get this championship under their belt
9145542 the last few have gone to celtic and this season in particular is the one that they will want to take and want to try and break that momentum that celtic have
9145543 irrespective of what happens there will be issues that develop in an old firm match whether it be a throw in corner a free kick or whatever a yellow card a red card its just the tense affair that old firm games carry

9145548 obviously we had some things that kind of didnt have the attention on our team but i think we fought through those things and we came together as a team and we made some strides and thats all you can ask for
9145549 i think we all grew up a little bit during that situation i think he did a very good job of handling a challenge handling a situation that there really wasnt a script for and was unprecedented i think it is definitely something he can learn from
9145550 its been a difficult time the last few months as far as the attention ive gotten but i think im ready for it i know its going to be amped up once the season starts im going to be scrutinized but thats the job of being an nfl quarterback theres a lot of pressure on you outside the building guys expect you to play well inside the locker room im ready for anything that comes
9145551 i think it is important for him to focus on playing quarterback and i think he has done a great job of that
9145552 i think he has done everything right as far as his focus how he has handled every step of the way to get through this process i think his play has reflected that and that is ultimately what he will be judged by
9145553 i felt that before the preseason started i think hes done all the things needed to prepare himself for this opportunity
9145554 i think were going to be tough to run on tough to pass on

9145572 green lights are unusual it rules out the so called chinese lanterns that accounted for some recent ufo sightings in the uk the images and description of the movement dont fit a list of things frequently reported as ufos aircraft lights meteors satellites this is a genuine mystery
9145573 given the sheer number of sightings weve seen this summer and the unprecedented number of photos and videos its time for a full public inquiry
9145574 the pictures are interesting it is a mystery someone should look into these pictures further

9145578 were awesome man thats what makes it all the more frustrating the guys put together a great rally and i didnt go shut them down if you dont score any runs you chalk it up to good starting pitching on the other side we battled against a good starting pitcher and scored what seven runs that makes it more frustrating that i couldnt hold them
9145579 its hard for me to lay my head on the pillow at night and blame someone else if i stay on my approach i have a better chance for success i got away from my approach tonight
9145580 was to come back and tie the game against a tough pitcher and self destruct with some sloppy play that did us in tonight definitely
9145581 they were scared to kick me the ball at central
9145582 he wasnt really coming at me like he wanted to tackle me
9145583 i was going to give him a move but once i saw him slow up i just kept running just turned on the burners
9145584 if i cannot find something satisfying here there is a possibility i might end up in japan playing ball
9145585 ive seen every team every ballpark i think it would be great to experience a new league and something new i played in japan in 2000 on the major league all star tour and i found it very cool good baseball good fans why not its a new culture
9145586 if they do some kind of tribute it would mean they will never see me again
9145587 that would be kind of sad that is kind of telling me this is your last day with the giants if i go down quiet it means they might be interested in me to come with them next year
9145588 i think it would be fun to meet her because shes an olympic medalist and shes from my home state
9145589 its a little tight so i changed the lineup to give him another day

9145599 we believe there may be an isolated number of products that are affected however we are recalling the entire australian product line as there can be no compromise when it comes to product quality or the health and safety of our consumers
9145600 we will not be shipping any more of this product until we have addressed the issue
9145601 we believe the problem is limited to a small number of products but we have recalled the whole product range just to be cautious
9145602 what we find is that most of the people that come to us are working families
9145603 we insure people who are struggling and to the extent that we can help out we want to
9145604 we would have to lose 140 million in order to be in a position of insolvency

9145626 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
9145627 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain

9145659 what i was keen to do with this one was to give the music more of a narrative role so that the music drives the whole thing then the fireworks and the pyrotechnics have got something to react to
9145660 backside of the story bridge looking down towards south bank
9145661 i had watched him win all those races and a lot of times one of my horses was getting beaten by him
9145662 the reason we ended up with all the gravy is that people saw him work his way up from 4 000 and they missed getting him for that price or 6 250 or 10 000 and had a hard time putting up 20 000 lamonte specifically claimed him to take him to santa anita for a first level allowance race for california breds
9145663 he found himself further back than usual because he hadnt run against that caliber of horses
9145664 theyre just faster horses early in a race we did get a nice trip on the rail but he ran game
9145665 i think you could make a case for at least half of the field and i think were one of those
9145666 ive been lucky enough to be around a few of these horses that get real good they have a confidence about them horses that win five or six in a row or eight of nine when they are on those kinds of runs they eat well train well look great and carry their head high thats what hes doing
9145667 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
9145668 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
9145669 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
9145670 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal

9145678 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
9145679 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
9145680 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
9145681 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
9145682 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
9145683 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
9145684 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
9145685 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
9145686 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
9145687 the thing is like many games you need to ignore the grognards because they love the game so much they kill it and nail it down under a nice piece of glass where it can stay pristine and untouched
9145688 canon is whats been established until a better idea comes along
9145689 we felt it was important to assume both insured and uninsured deposits and we believe it is our responsibility as a leading national institution to work with and support the fdic in providing safe harbors for depositors in this challenging time

9145692 i was expecting five sets i was there for four and five but he wasnt there anymore
9145693 i dont think its affected a whole lot of matches i dont know how many times its saved a match because thats what its there for really but at the big tournaments at the big courts usually you have the best linespeople as well
9145694 the worst linespeople are usually on the outside courts where you need it more thats the problem with the system
9145695 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
9145696 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
9145697 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
9145698 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
9145699 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
9145700 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
9145701 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
9145702 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
9145703 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
9145704 evidence and written submissions have been requested from each rider and a three member panel of the fei tribunal has been appointed
9145705 the panel will then in light of all the evidence received take a decision as to the applicable sanction if any
9145706 neither i nor my vets had ever heard of the drug felbinac until we got the call about myths positive test
9145707 anyone who knows me knows wholeheartedly that i would never dope my horse intentionally it is cheating it is not putting your best against the others best i have never been in a more torturous and frustrating situation trying to prove innocence is very hard it saddens me beyond description that my whole reputation could be blackened because of this situation
9145708 there is another drug very similar to this that is approved for horse use

9145739 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride

9145746 i like to climb mountains swim rivers and all that stuff
9145747 putting more police on the streets is short term long term is working with the retailers and the merchants reducing the opportunity
9145748 one of the things that robbers told us starting in the mid 90s is that they were branching out in the types of places they were robbing
9145749 found they could get more money in places that have cash nail salons barber shops coffee stands espresso stands flower stands anything that is a cash based enterprise and also hasnt been robbed in the past so doesnt have the same training
9145750 which is why we want people to keep less than 50 on hand
9145751 have a drop safe that is controlled on a time delay because the robber is not willing to wait for his money
9145752 the single most important thing to them is to not get caught at the time
9145753 we find that the chances are greatly increased of injury or death if the store owner has a gun
9145754 the robber already has his gun out so the odds of you getting your gun out without getting shot first are very low
9145755 the whole attitude that its somebody elses job to fix it is an absolutely wrongheaded direction
9145756 they have virtually no training whatsoever of the sales staff or the cashiers
9145757 toward the end of last year we set up a shattuck merchant watch group and the police came out and gave training to all of the merchants
9145758 but we had to reach out and ask for that help and i think there are a lot of small business owners who dont take that step because it doesnt occur to them or they dont know where to ask those questions
9145759 its important to have business owners here say theyre taking steps because that is a deterrent
9145760 we have taken steps but we are continuing to take more steps
9145761 were awesome man thats what makes it all the more frustrating the guys put together a great rally and i didnt go shut them down if you dont score any runs you chalk it up to good starting pitching on the other side we battled against a good starting pitcher and scored what seven runs that makes it more frustrating that i couldnt hold them
9145762 its hard for me to lay my head on the pillow at night and blame someone else if i stay on my approach i have a better chance for success i got away from my approach tonight
9145763 was to come back and tie the game against a tough pitcher and self destruct with some sloppy play that did us in tonight definitely
9145764 why are so many people who work at cons acting like jerks
9145765 how dare you ask me a question cant you see im deep in thought over here
9145766 jack names changed to protect the whatever went to go get them hell be back in a few minutes
9145767 why cant we just sign up under these sheets on the table that have the room assignments on them
9145768 because then jack would kill you he spent about an hour making these sheets it took him forever since he was using the mac version of microsoft word
9145769 well you need to go talk to someone in the rpga then
9145770 cant we just write it down on this paper our games are starting in 15 minutes
9145771 you could but id just rip it up and throw it in the garbage when you left
9145772 i have to go back for the sign up sheets next trip
9145773 i brought the sheets but i need someone to give me a pair of scissors to cut them out

9145776 why would you watch the tour de france without the doped up athletes

9145778 i think its going to be a great benefit to be able to work closer with these folks
9145779 i think its going to be a much better nicer work environment for the staff
9145780 i think it will be a nice area for the public too with easier access instead of trying to fight the traffic on euclid

9145783 people suspected of wrongdoing are knocked down and handcuffed all the time
9145784 i could maybe have a little more sympathy for the new york cyclist if he was not taking part in a critical mass ride
9145785 do you think maybe that same thought was going through the cops mind just before he took out the cyclist
9145786 i keep reading wonderful things about new york city and the efforts they are making to accommodate cyclists i am left to wonder what are these people protesting against when nyc is really trying to improve the cyclists lot
9145787 i could maybe have a little more sympathy for the new york cyclist if he was not taking part in a critical mass ride not my favorite organization
9145788 it looked to me to be totally over the top and inappropriate
9145789 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9145790 governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same

9145795 weve got to rediscover that zeal which won three elections and that is a huge problem for us at the moment
9145796 the epidemics curve appears to show that we have not yet reached the end of the outbreak because there have still been recent cases
9145797 it is reasonable to believe that these products could pose a threat to public health
9145798 in the industries i work in if you have something that critical you generally build more redundancy
9145799 if this faa outage happened at a power plant id be telling them to open up their checkbook and expect to be fined
9145800 dont happen on a mass scale or a regular basis
9145801 we are making sure people are getting from one place to another
9145802 we should see significant improvements by the end of september which should prevent the type of problem we had on tuesday
9145803 its common you see it in retail too its the whole dont fix it if it aint broke thing
9145804 its unfortunate because its very reactive and it typically winds up costing you more if you do fix on fail it usually costs you more

9145819 ultimately john mccain is at the top of the ticket he wants to take the country in the wrong direction im assuming governor palin agrees with him and his policies
9145820 i think you just figured out why i chose joe biden
9145821 because heres a man who wasnt born with a silver spoon in his mouth

9145856 nee er leven in nederland juist veel ondernemende families die hun kapitaal na hard werken willen doorgeven maar de weg niet kunnen vinden banken laten veel van de families toch lopen
9145857 wij hoeven niet meteen morgenrendement te tonen zoals veel banken we bepalen autonoom ons beleggingsadvies aan overnames doen we ook niet we hebben die niet nodig klanten zoeken nu stabiliteit fiduciair beheer zit ons zwitsers in het bloed maar in de nederlandse private bankingmarkt hebben we niet al onze krachten aangeboord
9145858 onze culturen vloeien in elkaar over dat is toch anders dan met de chinese cultuur die is meer gericht op het behalen van rendement liefst morgen zwitsers en nederlanders kijken naar de langere termijn europa is al tien jaar onze snelst groeiende markt
9145859 we adverteren zelden klanten komen via persoonlijke contacten bij ons daar stoppen onze partners veel tijd in maar de klant zelf is meestal ook een doorgewinterde investeerder die zijn voelhorens uit heeft dat zijn intelligente scherp handelende mensen via hun vermogensbeheerders en relaties horen ze al snel van ons

9145862 there have been a few players knocking on my door both literally and metaphorically and ive probably created an issue for myself but i always like to explain to them why theyre not in the side
9145863 youve got to be honest with people because itd be easy for me to pick the team and just announce it at two oclock on s a t u r d a y
9145864 players deserve an explanation to why theyre not in the side and how they can get back in weve got to work together its not a case of me laying down the law to them

9145875 but i do admit governor palin never came under fire in the balkans or yelled god d m america in church
9145876 as we got closer to the voting we made a decision to make sure that all the analysts that are on are non aligned

9145884 mi sembra che questo doppio cd edito nel 2005 ne sia la prova pi evidente
9145885 i think we can make a plus out of this
9145886 no disrespect to james maybe we will slightly go in a different direction and if we were to lose one player in one position it would be one of the wide men
9145887 you could argue about the clock on the wall with the deadline three days away making it a bit more tricky and i wouldnt disagree with you on that
9145888 but nevertheless i am pretty confident that we can overcome his loss in the next three days in different ways it might not just be one player it might be two its a winwin weve got some more money in the pot should we choose to use it in this window or the next its there for us its not a sale we had to do but at the end of the day we said yes we should do it now
9145889 thats the first thing ive got to say although that doesnt mean in any shape or form that we want to see michael owen leave this club
9145890 but look around football and look whats happening im afraid a club and a manager not wanting a player to go sometimes is not enough
9145891 joey will be on the bench its probably a week ten days early but common sense will prevail with joey
9145892 we dont know whats going to happen on september 5 a group of people have got to sit down at the fa and do whatever theyve got to do some people think he might he might get 15 games which sounds ridiculous but it wouldnt be unbelievable for him to get very few because he has missed a lot of games

9145896 i really think this location is going to be one of the bright spots for michigan and especially for the thumb in the future
9145897 this is still a planned facility in cass city though
9145898 its not a done deal yet and it wont be a done deal until we put the shovel in the ground
9145899 we seem to be getting a lot more people than we used to coming to the farm and looking for work
9145900 there are larger and larger milk volumes in michigan but there isnt the processing capacity nor is there the consumer demand in michigan to use up those increased volumes
9145901 the product were shipping is still liquid but by removing some of the water it allows us to transport that to customers at a lower transportation cost
9145902 by not paying to transport that extra water it results in significant savings in transportation especially with expensive diesel fuel
9145903 cass citys willingness to work so closely with us is one of the main reasons that location stands out above our other options
9145904 we also were looking at a township city or village that had wastewater treatment capacity and cass citys treatment plant is at only about one third of its capacity
9145905 finally reiser said he admired the district attorney and the police for their skill and dedication
9145906 and even funnier he wants to have access to a computer to continue his work and to help to provide support for his children
9145907 he has a snowballs chance in hell at that plan
9145908 this is the first time this year that we have turned up and already known the track
9145909 i know oschersleben the team knows oschersleben and it makes such a difference because you can just start working straight away but i think the other teams will pass us in the next session though

9145911 they see their jobs shipped overseas theyve seen the cost of everything from healthcare to college to gas to food skyrocket even though their incomes and their wages havent gone up
9145912 john mccain just does not get what ordinary people here in beaver pa are going through
9145913 is not just what it means for them but what it means to their children or their grandchildren
9145914 you know that if we keep going the way were going
9145915 a whole lot of young people growing up in beaver are going to decide that they cant make a living and they dont have a future here
9145916 amy winehouse was regrettably unable to perform at the rock en seine show in paris due to
9145917 she was taken ill at her house and wasnt able to travel to france for the concert
9145918 even if the use of the taser by the police cannot be considered to be the medical cause of death it is apparent that considering he was in an agitated and intoxicated state receiving several electrical discharges possibly contributed to his death
9145919 all we feel is that if we have our questions answered and we have the policemens version we will feel a little bit better
9145920 it still wont bring quilem back but if we have justice then maybe we will feel a little bit better
9145921 if they would have taken the time to use better judgment maybe the situation would have been different
9145922 were asking for a public inquiry to re evaluate the entire situation
9145923 the officers should have been capable of profiting from the window of opportunity from the first discharge to bring the suspect under control
9145924 its not normal that it would take six charges to subdue him
9145925 i think that until we have serious studies on intoxicated or sick persons that are conclusive the taser should also be considered as a weapon that can lead to death
9145926 we have to ask for justice thats the only thing we can do right now and thats what quilem would have wanted

9145937 im paid to make decisions and sometimes theyre very difficult
9145938 hes had a fantastic impact in the first two league games and ive got to decide whether he starts or if his impact for us is still best from the bench
9145939 it was hard to pick a team last year because we didnt have players available this time its hard because there isnt a player who doesnt deserve to be playing in the first team
9145940 for some of them thats difficult to deal with but the attitude has been spot on
9145941 stoke will scrap and fight for everything and we know it will be a hard game but if we play to our capabilities then we can win
9145942 el primer d a de monta a se ver si puedo disputar o no
9145943 me gustar a ganar las tres grandes si no es ahora no pasa nada tengo 25 a os
9145944 i hope there is some of that united spirit in us because we have a never give up attitude
9145945 you saw it at man united when the manager was playing because of his character and desire to drive the team on
9145946 players also have to have that themselves though and we have a few characters in the dressing room who are ready to stick their foot in and get dirty that is a big part of team spirit and getting results
9145947 we know looking around the dressing room and know they are willing to go right to the end we have shown that against forest
9145948 we are a new team with new players and we are looking forward to moving on
9145949 we are going in the right direction and the manager is strengthening the squad if another defender comes in whoever comes in i am not going to roll the red carpet out they will have to work hard
9145950 i am always a player who wants to win and have the same desire to win as the manager
9145951 whatever happened at their previous clubs is none of my business
9145952 if i think im going to have a long and successful career without facing different characters im kidding myself ive not been put off by players reputations look at all the managers whove been successful and they enjoy the challenge of different people
9145953 you have to learn from mistakes weve all made them but whats happened is in the past and i cant talk about what a player has done at his previous club
9145954 with the lads whove come in i take it how i see it conflict has never been a problem to me i challenge people i eyeball them and say youve taken your eye off the ball and im comfortable with doing that i have to let people be themselves in terms of what drive and how they dress and give them the freedom to do what they want as long as it doesnt affect their football people talk about these so called characters because theyre flamboyant and they dress differently but they still want to win
9145955 i saw a lot as a player and i dealt with it a lot as a player at united it was a strong dressing room and if a player took his eye off the ball they were told
9145956 as a player i dealt with many players one to one if i thought they werent pulling their weight if i didnt step in another senior player would
9145957 ive always had that with me i fell out with people when i was eight nine ten years old with people who didnt train properly i fell out with a good friend of mine when we were kids because he wouldnt go training one night he wanted to go out on his skateboard instead
9145958 im delighted with the players weve got at the club
9145959 we have been waiting for a few to come back from injury and hopefully they are all there or thereabouts now
9145960 if we can keep the squad fit it is a better squad than last year and if we do not get as many injuries we should do as well as last year
9145961 the players we had lined up to join were good players so weve had to compromise
9145962 but weve had to wait for the likes of billy clarke and liam you have to keep your finger on the pulse with whats happening at all these clubs and when these players become available you have to try to get them
9145963 weve brought franz in and that has given us an option on the left weve brought liam in up front and robin is an option in midfield there are other options too
9145964 what you think your best xi for one game is not always going to be the same after a performance
9145965 we played a different shape on tuesday three in midfield two wide men and one up front and it worked ever so well
9145966 i was disappointed to lose on tuesday because i thought we had better scoring chances it is a little boost to play like we did but winning games gives you a bigger boost and im sick of saying weve played well but still havent won
9145967 apart from the second half in the first game of the season all the performances have been encouraging and we should have a lot more points by now than we have
9145968 its pleasing that were playing a lot better football than we were at this stage last season but we havent got as many points
9145969 its time to turn these good performances into winning performances
9145970 it was an excellent goal it had been a long time since gregg had 90 minutes under his belt and he ended up getting 120 minutes which just shows you how fit he is
9145971 with us having no reserve team now we had talked about him going out on loan to get some games
9145972 but that changes now because hes had 120 minutes so hes fit and ready to go
9145973 to be the poster girl for 2012 would be a huge achievement
9145974 its something i would definitely look forward to because i live very close to the site of the olympics but its up to other people to decide
9145975 realistically its something i have to put up with whether i like it or not
9145976 its not something i let get to me too much because my job as an athlete is to keep on performing and thats what im going to do
9145977 i am not expecting people to forget but its important that i keep doing what i like doing working honestly thats what i believe in it doesnt bother me too much any more
9145978 if you cant sell that then what is the london games about
9145979 maybe the face is not the one you want to see but if you cant sell the olympic world and commonwealth champion what does that say about london and what we are doing
9145980 how would you feel if you ended up in prison you have been released and you are trying to do your honest days work and people keep bringing up the past
9145981 christine is an excellent role model for people of any kind to emulate
9145982 shes a great example for children to say okay thats the kind of person i want to be
9145983 christine has overcome disappointments but the overriding lesson she teaches people is to stay committed a lot of todays society is geared around instant gratification
9145984 it took years and thats what people have to realise you have to be patient and christine proves that patience will be rewarded if youre willing to put in the work
9145985 its a real honour that people are ready to recognise my achievements
9145986 things have happened to me that i never imagined would be possible
9145987 usain spoke to me after the olympics and said he was very happy for me he said he watched me compete and was cheering me on
9145988 i shook the prime ministers hand coming off the plane and that was a great thing for me
9145989 then he wrote me a letter telling me he was happy i came over here i still cant really believe ive had a letter from the prime minister
9145990 i was worried that the british people might not accept me
9145991 i wondered if they would think i was jamaican and worried that they might think i was coming over here to steal their athletes glory
9145992 but my dad is british so ive always been half british and i feel extremely proud to be representing this country
9145993 now i feel like other people have accepted me as well its been overwhelming when i walk down the street people i dont know are coming up to me to tell me well done
9145994 its a great feeling for me because with me being from jamaica i didnt think people would recognise me like that
9145995 i think i must have done a great job for them to know who i am
9145996 i didnt think he would run quite as fast as he did
9145997 hes the muhammad ali of track and field at the moment
9145998 we had a lot of games last season when we dominated but conceded sloppy goals thats an area thats going to be massive for us he said
9145999 possibly we may have to be less gung ho if we get ourselves into the lead we must make sure we can just see the game out
9146000 i think weve got a very positive team who always want to go forward and entertain
9146001 but sometimes we have to tweak that a little bit and say hold on lets make sure we get the three points and that may be the way we approach certain games this year
9146002 you can play well every week but if you dont win people can lose heart and confidence so youve got to get that fine balance between attack and defence added wilson
9146003 we played well away from home last season at times but we didnt win all we can do is put the performances in again and hope that we turn them into results
9146004 we want to improve our away form but we dont want to do that at the expense of our home form
9146005 we want to marry both together and if we do that then were in with a shout
9146006 we werent bright enough to win it on the night

9146035 shit my bangs looks like sailor moons why did i cut my hair again
9146036 when my 19 year old son moved out there were people he met who didnt know how to do basic things like washing dishes or laundry
9146037 ive met people in their 40s who didnt know how to budget so my son and i sat down and started to write down these easy to read informational sheets
9146038 its hard enough to admit you dont know how to do that when you think about it its horrifying
9146039 things have changed so much teaching children to survive has become ill teach them later

9146044 it was a bomb placed close to an apple vendor in pettah
9146045 forty four people have been admitted to hospital including two children and four women
9146046 our helicopters almost did not fly for most part of the day yesterday since it continued raining heavily till four in the evening
9146047 i saw a villager tightly clutching a branch and a snake hanging from another branch of tree nearly half submerged in the floodwater while fleeing my village
9146048 these are some of the worst floods in generations and they present a huge challenge for governments and humanitarian organisations
9146049 it is critical that we get emergency assistance to these people in the coming days
9146050 i sold my goat for just 50 rupees which on any other day could have brought me 2 000 rupees
9146051 we believe its a malaysian bulk carrier and it was hijacked last night
9146052 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
9146053 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
9146054 it is not about depending or not depending on a few players of course it is an achievement but you can not just sit back on it and say we won the twenty20 world cup the tri series in australia or now here in sri lanka you have to continue doing it
9146055 if you have players like sachin and sehwag it really helps in doing and achieving these things consistently but it their absence is not really in control because at times you will have injuries
9146056 we didnt had ishant sharma we didnt had sachin and veeru sehwag but it is upto other individuals to take up the responsibility because there is no point in sitting and sulking about guys who are not there
9146057 they are the guys who are part of the 16 who can really make a difference and they were doing just that
9146058 but of course you miss individuals specially the great players
9146059 in the middle it is very important to rotate strikes and we have been able to do that we got the partnerships we played the spinners well we negotiated murali well i think we played him really well it has been tough over the years to play murali in sri lanka i think we tackled ajantha mendis quite well too
9146060 overall i was quite impressed by the way we performed
9146061 i really enjoyed the break and the main thing is i was enjoying the practice session more and it sets a good trend
9146062 you have to give 100 per cent there as well you just can not bat for 20 minutes and go under the shade when you feel from inside to go under the shade that is the time when you realize your body needs rest
9146063 i was happy to get some rest thanks to the selectors and the bcci
9146064 when you have the right side it helps it is not about just randomly picking someone the guys who have performed well in the domestic circuit and others have been picked up in the side
9146065 and have never had the pleasure of traveling to see the play i am in love with idina and kristin and this made my day
9146066 you didnt have seven eight nine shows that appealed to audiences of 12 to 25 year olds and that online is where they find their entertainment
9146067 looking forward to doing a lot of great things i think the best is yet to come in my true humble opinion
9146068 people see some of the things i do and they say why dont you show this to the world people dont know you do these things and maybe i will
9146069 ill just have a little cake with my children and well probably watch some cartoons
9146070 i am letting them enjoy their childhood as much as possible
9146071 this happened quite soon after the original burial its not that a grave robber took it centuries later and hid it with the intention of coming back
9146072 the young workman who saw it was astounded and shouted land mine
9146073 archaeologists must explain why such a group was found outside the extensive royal cemetery
9146074 work out why the bones of the unknown but by no means insignificant person were hidden in the citys most public and sacred area
9146075 if youve got an event the size of the olympics and youve got billions and billions of people watching it you definitely have a backing track and mime to it because anything could go wrong
9146076 its just a safety first thing you cannot take the risk
9146077 we share artists all the time and conductors all the time
9146078 it was all prerecorded and the mso melbourne symphony orchestra did record a minority of the music that was performed
9146079 its correct that we were basically miming to a pre recording
9146080 i always knew that i wanted to be an entertainer yeah i know it may sound a little corny but i always wanted to be a star
9146081 but the real truth is that i always wanted to get away from my family and i wanted to get as far away from my father as possible
9146082 when i tell people who have seen me rehearse it that its all true they usually go
9146083 the basketball team well one of my uncles was a drug addict he was into heroin he gave me some methadone id put it in water drink it and go to school we called them fizzies coach found out and ratted on me to my parents still high i came into the gym and went after him that was an isolated incident
9146084 to know joe is to know that he is a tenacious relentless hardworking performer and yes he is talented
9146085 when it comes to the audience we say things like kill em knock em in the aisles with a one man show its just you you make it or you break it theres no one else to blame
9146086 we were called the half breeds the ricans that other parents didnt want their kids to hang out with
9146087 boxing teaches you how to be a man and it teaches you how to talk with your hands
9146088 basically i spent my whole life running away from this man
9146089 i ran around the whole world to get away from this man
9146090 i cried over it i had to smoke during breaks looking back it was about me and my dad there are poignant moments beautiful moments and some not so pretty moments but all i can say is that its reality its my truth
9146091 in texas you can shoot a mother for stealing your neighbors s
9146092 at home were not at war were at wal mart
9146093 i know youre doin it for the money you all make a lot of money i know
9146094 i know there are good people in san francisco but just know this is a very conservative town there are some bad people but mostly its just a nice conservative town
9146095 it was pretty calm we only had about three or four ieds nothing major
9146096 all those people from the middle east who have some sort of envy or jealousy toward the u s
9146097 i have always been driven to the desert i think the landscape itself influences people in a certain way
9146098 we experienced the desert and the sun and the extreme cold in the desert to the nonstop rain in oregon i think the weather and the landscape also influences the character
9146099 this is the exploration of the mystery of a woman called sylvia who has an emotional journey that takes her to the extremes it explores what makes her so damaged
9146100 you should ask people that question why are people so flawed because thats who we are
9146101 why is it when you watch a film and something happens that moves you it either moves you to tears or gives a chill down your spine its because we can see ourselves in that moment
9146102 there is something about kim theres a strength with her leftover vulnerability from her 20s thats just unbelievably beautiful to watch there are moments on the screen when shes shaking her entire body is shaking for real you couldnt act that
9146103 where the law as the content of the paradosis is no longer understood to be the present concrete requirement of god demanding the self surrender of man but rather serves as a form of human righteousness which can be manipulated by man himself in the interests of his own self justification then the law in question is to be rejected
9146104 opposes the tendency to establish the law as an absolute by putting forward the point of view that the law exists for the sake of man and not man for the sake of the law by this means he refers us back from the law to the lawgiver and thus changes as radically as possible the meaning of the law itself by restoring its original connexion with the divine covenant the rabbis have forgotten the consolation and the promise of the law and no longer envisage the scriptures as a whole as the book of the covenant the document which bears witness to the covenant grace of god
9146105 ik heb de auto beter onder de knie dan op de eerste dag
9146106 de klassementsritten lagen me ook wat beter ze waren sneller in vergelijking met de eerste dag
9146107 maar ik remde te veel met mijn linkervoet waardoor de remmen overbelast zijn geraakt

9146119 we gaan slechts handelen vanuit een mandaat van de vlaamse regering die moet akkoord gaan om zon dialoog te voeren wat mij betreft is het zonneklaar dat ik als minister president niet deelneem aan een dialoog als niet de voltallige vlaamse regering daarachter staat
9146120 het is belangrijk dat de leiding van die dialoog niet langer bij de federale regering ligt het is wel zinvol om de federale ministers erbij te betrekken maar het debat moet gestuurd worden vanuit de deelstaten en de delegaties die zij afvaardigen
9146121 de volgende dagen en weken zijn van essentieel belang ik ga ervan uit dat we voor 21 en 22 september duidelijkheid krijgen of we zon dialoog kunnen opstarten met de randvoorwaarden die voor ons essentieel zijn
9146122 er is geen eerste pakket en geen tweede pakket van de staatshervorming die 400 miljoen euro die men aan ons gevraagd heeft gaan wij niet honoreren
9146123 wij zullen nu binnen de vlaamse regering kijken in welke mate wij zelf zinvolle sociale maatregelen kunnen treffen waar heel de vlaamse regering achterstaat

9146132 he wished me all the best and told me he didnt want to lose me
9146133 he told me that he wanted to keep me but the offer was accepted

9146144 as well as that the english outfit have an option to buy the polish striker
9146145 it was very difficult because i think it was two or three weeks after my injury that the club started to have all the problems
9146146 so i remember i was on crutches and the club went into administration and they told me they were going to release me and it wasnt good
9146147 it wasnt good because if you are playing you can go anywhere and prove that youre worth a contract with another team but when this happened to me i was on crutches
9146148 there was an option to return to uruguay it wasnt a good moment but even worse if youre miles way from home so i thought about going home and being with my friends and family
9146149 there was an even an option of never playing again but i think i am very strong mentally
9146150 i went to start rehabilitation and mixu paatelainen called me and told me about the possibility to play here
9146151 there is absolutely nothing i can do in terms of qualification
9146152 i cant qualify in the euro points list and i cant qualify in the world rankings list so as far as thats concerned i am as relaxed as they come
9146153 but i have been playing some very solid golf recently my focus is this week trying to give myself the opportunity to win 10 million and try and win a golf tournament

9146156 my communication with nick has been pretty good so i am sure he will tell me when hes made the decision it could be distracting but i think i always want to know
9146157 they tottenham had several weeks of time to buy him and they did not offer 22 million 18m like everybody has been writing but just 16 million
9146158 whoever wins or loses this one will not make much difference to what is going to be the outcome of the season
9146159 what it will do is appease your set of fans appease everybody at the training ground and at the club
9146160 and before you know it its gone and the next game is upon you and you have to dust yourself down if you get beat and go again
9146161 rangers this season have got to look to try and get this championship under their belt
9146162 the last few have gone to celtic and this season in particular is the one that they will want to take and want to try and break that momentum that celtic have
9146163 irrespective of what happens there will be issues that develop in an old firm match whether it be a throw in corner a free kick or whatever a yellow card a red card its just the tense affair that old firm games carry

9146177 we had a bad fishing year that year so we didnt have any money
9146178 so we decided to spend 35 bucks and go down to the courthouse
9146179 the iraqi surge is the major differentiator with previous operations
9146180 we feel better more secure and safe we can go outside without being frightened
9146181 security can freeze diyala so it doesnt get any worse but politics is needed to solve it
9146182 the only way of really solving diyala is through the political roots such as provincial elections and a more balanced provincial council
9146183 al qaida in iraq is really hoping to survive and sustain its struggle over time and hoping that its forces will change in the future but not engaging any direct contact now
9146184 no matter how much our message is ignored or ridiculed as was done in the campaign no matter how much they did to us it only energized our grass roots
9146185 our focus is really on this side of the river
9146186 we think theres enough excitement and energy on this side
9146187 we only want to cause noise in the sense of letting people know there are other movements out there that other people believe in
9146188 i feel as one person who stands up i have a voice and letting it be heard sends fear to the establishment
9146189 there might be a chance we survive eight years of bush i dont know thats where the hope comes in
9146190 barack obamas message of hope has inspired americans all across the country and we couldnt imagine a more fitting place for robert indiana to unveil his hope sculpture than at the convergence of this movement for change in denver

9146192 people dont have a lot of exposure to the army
9146193 its incumbent upon the american public to know about their army
9146194 an outstanding choice that should be extremely reassuring to the conservative base

9146196 a woman of faith who has a strong position on life a consistent opinion on judges shes the complete package
9146197 the question is how this will be received by a lot of rank and file evangelicals who are just americans struggling along going to their megachurches and care about values
9146198 mccain is saying to social and religious conservatives im taking your views incredibly seriously

9146200 the us is in very real danger from a politically ignorant uninformed electorate
9146201 as chairman of the senate foreign relations committee biden is well versed in policy debates and carefully choreographed trips but his record on the islamic republic of iran perhaps the chief national security threat facing the next president suggests a persistent and dangerous judgment deficit
9146202 with the selection of senator joe biden as senator obamas vice president the democrats ticket has now become an even greater gamble for the jewish community throughout his career senator biden has consistently been wrong on iran and his voting record on israel has been inconsistent like obama biden fundamentally misunderstands the threat posed by an iran determined to obtain nuclear weapons biden has continuously demonstrated poor judgment on iran he has voted against significant legislation that would pressure iran to stop pursuing nuclear weapons biden has failed to recognize the serious threat that iran poses to israel and the us and its allies in the middle east
9146203 iran is not a nuclear threat to the united states of america
9146204 the jewish community was already gravely concerned with senator obamas naive understanding of the iranian threat an obama biden ticket has proven that it is ill equipped to deal with this threat by selecting senator biden to join his ticket voting for senator obama has now become an even greater risk

9146277 moreover cutting our consumption of oil will not do anything to reduce our dependance on oil from the middle east first because other countries countries we trade with will still be using the stuff so changes in oil prices will continue to whipsaw our economy and second because the price of oil is set on the world market if we cut world consumption back to 20 million barrels a day we would be totally dependent on middle eastern oil because theyre the low cost producers it takes if i recall correctly less than 5 a barrel to pull oil out of the ground in saudi the middle east will be the last place to close the taps the more we cut world consumption the more dependent well be on crazy middle eastern governments those governments might not be as rich but well still need them just as much as long as oil remains critical

9146297 uit het onderzoek van deloitte blijkt dat 61 procent van de nederlanders de prijs als de belangrijkste reden noemt om biologische producten niet te kopen
9146298 dat is een stijging met 6 procent tegenover vorig jaar van de ondervraagden gaf 13 procent aan meer biologische producten te zullen kopen als het prijsverschil tussen de reguliere en biologische producten kleiner wordt van de consumenten wil 14 procent dat het aanbod uitgebreid wordt vooral als het gaat om vlees groente en fruit

9146303 thats the router youre waiting for so the new network configuration can converge
9146304 scalability may be limited by stuff you bought 10 years ago that you cant afford to replace yet
9146305 it would need to be embraced by vendors if cisco picked it up it would have impact
9146306 initial tests have shown that network load could be reduced by a factor of five or more without compromising network performance
9146307 at the same time speeds are increased by about 20 percent
9146308 we think we have one of the most extensible rigorous architectures for making these applications run more efficiently
9146309 the project seems to have a momentum of its own

9146312 where arises the question of a peace formula or compromise formula when the fourth round of talks between governors panel and the samitis committee has not taken place so far
9146313 during the first three rounds of talk on august 23 we have already given written demands to the governors panel headed by his advisor s s bloeria
9146314 the fourth round of talks was delayed twice and is now scheduled for today and we are waiting for it to be held
9146315 the government has to respond to our demands and then the samiti will decide on it
9146316 on the one hand i feel the usual sense of annoyance that large sums of public money are being spent to brainwash the people of wales into supporting the transfer of more powers to the welsh assembly
9146317 on the other hand i am relieved that the civil servants being paid to run this body have apparently done so little so far
9146318 throughout the whole process the families wanted to make sure that the designers were creating a park where people could come and remember and reflect and renew
9146319 so its a major success on an intellectual front as well
9146320 i am conscious of the fact that this park does do that for people when they come out here
9146321 this is a needed first step toward returning the company to profit
9146322 the next fundamental move will be to choose the right international partner
9146323 considering that ga is the primary form of long distance transportation in the forty ninth state its not surprising that gov palin has taken a stand on the user fee issue
9146324 in may 2007 she signed a resolution in opposition to the faas plan to increase avgas taxes impose user fees and slash airport funding aopa and the alaska airmens association had worked together to move the resolution through the alaska legislature
9146325 were headed to the next adventure out on the plains of meridiani
9146326 we safely got into the crater we completed our exploration there and we safely got out we were concerned that any wheel failure on our aging rover could have left us trapped inside the crater
9146327 obviously during that time frame the fight in sadr city was a very kinetic fight
9146328 with the threat of these areas being lower and the ground guys focusing more on nonlethal operations we of course conduct fewer lethal operations as well
9146329 if you look at the big picture the less we have to shoot and destroy targets or kill insurgents indicates that we are getting closer to mission success in iraq
9146330 the changing nature of our attack and reconnaissance missions reflects a greater level of security among the people a demonstrated capability of the iraqi police and army and a general improvement in the daily lives of the population
9146331 this would not be possible without the continued efforts of our ground partners to transition security to the iraqis and aid in the economic development of their areas these positive trends have allowed us to provide a greater degree of overwatch and a reduced level of direct action
9146332 because of the progress of the iraqis and their ability to handle their own internal affairs with minimal coalition support the decision was made to minimize our presence around karbala
9146333 it bolsters the iraqis confidence not only the iraqi security forces confidence but also the confidence of the iraqi population in the security forces ability to do its job
9146334 any responsibilities we can hand over to the iraqis that they can execute with a degree of success gets us closer to mission completion here
9146335 the importance of introducing in malaysia aircraft complying with the highest standards of performance comfort and safety in todays regional aviation market the atr aircraft will become a main player in the development of the tourism and the business activities in our country while allowing both maswings and firefly to achieve the lowest operating costs in short haul routes
9146336 the preservation of the environment in borneo is one of our major concerns
9146337 with our atr 72 500s we will be strongly contributing to the development of the sustainable tourism in east malaysia the 500 series is well reputed worldwide for its impressive safety record and is also a very reliable aircraft featuring the lowest cost per passenger and the lowest levels of noise and vibrations inside the cabin
9146338 with the atrs we will consolidate our young carrier with very safe and environment friendly aircraft
9146339 throughout the whole process the families wanted to make sure that the designers were creating a park where people could come and remember and reflect and renew
9146340 we are very glad to see our embraer 190 serving more chinese passengers through the reliable operation of kunpeng airlines
9146341 we believe that the embraer 190 with its superior performance economics and comfort will meet our chinese customers fleet needs and contribute to its growth plans and success
9146342 we are very pleased to take delivery of our first embraer 190 jet which we believe will be an ideal aircraft for us to explore the emerging chinese regional aviation market
9146343 with this reliable new model entering service we will be dedicated to building our company into the most sizable characteristic and competitive regional airline in mainland china
9146344 for the swedish patient now theres no question he is out of risk for the other i have moderate optimism
9146345 these cases came earlier than expected under monotherapy i always expected to see some in 2009 i never expected to see them in 2008
9146346 if present at all was very small and statistically non significant and may simply be a healthy user artifact that they previous studies were unable to identify
9146347 the healthy user effect is seen in what doctors often refer to as their good patients patients who are well informed about their health who exercise regularly do not smoke or have quit drink only in moderation watch what they eat come in regularly for health maintenance visits and disease screenings take their medications exactly as prescribed and quite religiously get vaccinated each year so as to stay healthy such attributes are almost impossible to capture in large scale studies using administrative databases
9146348 while such a reduction in all cause mortality would have been impressive these mortality benefits are likely implausible
9146349 we have technology now to allow us to globally assess what igf is doing in breast cancer at the whole gene expression level
9146350 this is one of the first studies to do that we know that igf is bad in cancer but now we can globally understand it in a more comprehensive manner it could lead to finding biomarkers for patients response to breast cancer treatments
9146351 we found that igf i is a major regulator of cell growth and cell survival it also regulates dna repair
9146352 smoking during pregnancy is a double edged sword with respect to sids
9146353 not only does it raise a mothers likelihood of having a preterm baby who is already among the most vulnerable to sids but it increases the infants susceptibility to sids even further
9146354 preterm babies are known to have increased breathing difficulties in proportion to their prematurity and cigarette smoke is known to increase apneas in full term babies
9146355 but until now cigarette smoke exposure and preterm birth have not been investigated together with respect to their potential effects on respiratory dysfunction
9146356 alabama wing has activated a mission command staff and is identifying aircrew ground team urban direction finding udf team and mission staff members who are available for a one or two week tour after the storm makes landfall

9146360 preparation for bad weather has been at the top of mind and we prepare for it all year
9146361 its a case of a large number of people making a big unexpected rush to service stations
9146362 if its a gigantic storm and theres a reason to evacuate i want to be prepared ahead of time
9146363 unfortunately many people feel the need to manually remove earwax called cerumen which serves an important protective function for the ear
9146364 cotton swabs and some other home remedies can push cerumen further into the canal potentially foiling the natural removal process and instead cause build up known as impaction
9146365 when cerumen builds to the point of causing symptoms such as pain ringing itching or hearing problems its a sign you should see a physician
9146366 the complications from cerumen impaction can be painful and include infections and hearing loss it is hoped that these guidelines will give clinicians the tools they need to spot an issue early and avoid serious outcomes
9146367 we have gotten more calls this year probably an increase of 25 percent

9146371 with the economy the way it is i get 10 calls a week to sell real estate
9146372 the problem is unless im selling the entire estate and the personal property and other assets around it i really dont have the time to mess with it
9146373 it blooms in the evening with a delightful fragrance the scent floats in the air like a gardenia but much softer its ideal for placement near an entry or in night gardens
9146374 i was up at 5 a m today and i was crying
9146375 if it wasnt for the march and a lot of the activity it would be a downer
9146376 two of the gas stations around us are already out of gas
9146377 the boat was overcrowded because people panicked to be rescued and clambered on board
9146378 we cant assess the extent of the damage it is colossal
9146379 but we will only be able to tell the extent after the water recedes
9146380 one guy said he was going to make 1 500 bucks for the whole summer and they helped pay for some of his expenses to get across the border
9146381 theyve been living up there for 60 to 90 days they know all the ins and outs
9146382 all of us would have loved it if he picked mitt because we love mitt lets be honest
9146383 it was just setting up a democratic attack on the republicans as the party of wealth the party not open to voters in pennsylvania or ohio he romney would have just fueled those attacks
9146384 the mccain campaign played chicken with evangelicals and they didnt blink so mccain did
9146385 as much as the lds church has invested in public relations and trying to improve how the church is viewed in the south it may take another hundred years for these voters to get past the mormon issue
9146386 mccain needed to make a really bold and historic selection to change the dynamics of this race to give him any chance to win
9146387 the choice of gov palin doesnt reflect poorly on gov romney he represented himself well in his run and how he supported the ticket after he was defeated
9146388 big plans for mitt romney and mitt romney has big plans for the party
9146389 mitt is poised to fill that vacuum even though he wont hold any formal position
9146390 he will be heavily engaged in policy matters he will be a voice in how to solve our nations problems at this critical time in history
9146391 the republican party is almost ridiculously predictable on how we choose our nominees
9146392 its always the person who came in second the time before
9146393 if mccain picks romney it will change the tide in utah
9146394 all of the seats that democrats had been thinking they had already won or seats they believed were in play get reversed
9146395 it was an insult to all the people of utah
9146396 not just because they are women but because they are strong capable and intelligent
9146397 they will continue to look at the candidates based on their qualifications their character and their approach to government it doesnt matter who is on the presidential ticket
9146398 the judgment was entered based upon false incomplete and misleading evidence the defendant presented at a hearing on march 1 2007
9146399 these were good people who wanted to accomplish so much good in their lives
9146400 when something like this happens your first thought is how can you go on
9146401 said niels valentiner liz valentiner johnsons father and one of the founders of choice humanitarian
9146402 but we realize the worst thing we could do is to walk away from this work
9146403 this is a great loss but we will have others continue out the mission
9146404 we have to continue on so that what they did is not wasted
9146405 optimize economic returns through needed redesign all within the context of an envelope that has existing permits and approvals
9146406 we need to rethink our development model the capital markets remain in disarray
9146407 we dont think we have any iron clad solutions but hopefully were going to get it done
9146408 one of the things about the hotel market is that people propose developments to preclude other hotel developments
9146409 as we get into the middle of next year weve got to see if this projects going to fly
9146410 the scale and relationship to the adjacent sites provides the diversity we need between the two large buildings
9146411 i dont know what mccains motives are but i cant imagine any hillary supporters supporting a conservative like palin shes pro life and it seems shed oppose virtually everything hillary talked about during the campaign
9146412 a positive role model for women in politics remember this countrys made up of hundreds of thousands of small towns and that they represent america at its core
9146413 for all the reagan democrats who had supported hillary this decision clinches it for the mccain ticket
9146414 having palin locks these women in women are looking for a positive role model not the angry and bitter female politicians weve seen so much of lately
9146415 does he really think that just because were women and he has a woman vice president that well all vote for her people supported hillary not simply because she was a woman but because she was a qualified woman and sarah palin is no hillary clinton
9146416 being tokenized and if she does get in and turns out to be a disaster then as women were all screwed forever
9146417 if anything happens to john mccain this woman would be our president she was mayor of wasilla alaska i mean san joses bigger than that regardless of whether shes a woman or a man i find that prospect frightening either way
9146418 i suspect theres a part of that in there but the choice for vice president is a lot more important than just picking a characteristic thatll swing a few voters
9146419 john is picking her as a natural successor i dont think gender matters one way or another in how he made his choice
9146420 i think it was a stab to try and save the ticket by trying to get hillarys supporters to join mccain

9146430 another shopping center for those of us getting 2 pay raises while prices have escalated at least 50 over the last year
9146431 are you the same people who complain about the government taking away our rights the article did not mention any tax incentives for the purchase nor did it mention any of you wanting to purchase the property
9146432 wow sounds like its going to take an already overcongested area and turn it into a traffic nightmare
9146433 hundreds if not thousands will fall through the cracks of an evacuation plan and they will be left in the city not out of choice but out of necessity
9146434 a lot of vultures trying to make a deal here and make some money
9146435 is going to get hot but its not going to be the kind of year most people hoped for
9146436 any major station group will tell you this year has been a huge disappointment

9146439 we asked for a study because we wanted to document that if a chain hotel came here it would be lucrative

9146452 aopa believes the agency needs to put a special emphasis on preserving and improving americas general aviation airports increasing all weather access to those airports and finding an unleaded alternative to todays low lead aviation gasoline
9146453 the agency has done excellent work in helping to protect and preserve general aviation throughout the country and this must be a continued area of emphasis that is included in the faas flight plan
9146454 americas airports are the access point for the nation to the air transportation network without a robust airport network the countrys ability to maintain its leading role in the world economic arena will be adversely effected
9146455 the faa must build on this visionary work and focus resources on developing plans policies and budgets that not only preserve the airports that we have today but also ensure their future through infrastructure investments
9146456 waas avionics enable pilots to use more than 1 000 new precision waas lpv approaches many at airports where there is no other precision approach landing system
9146457 however without the continued expansion of lpv approaches the potential benefits available from the waas system are underutilized
9146458 the establishment of a strategy in 2009 and the implementation of that strategy in the follow on years will provide the public with confidence that all elements of aviation are concerned about the future of our environment
9146459 the faa needs to remain focused on providing pilots with a diverse and robust integrated airport system services that support operations at general aviation airports in all weather conditions and the ability to successfully transition from todays low lead gasoline to a completely unleaded gasoline
9146460 im getting out of here i cant take another hurricane
9146461 this storm will be destructive where it goes will determine whether it knocks down trees and floods bayous or whether it destroys communities
9146462 avoid the traffic that we all know is coming everyone that stays home through the storm should be able to sustain themselves for at least seven days without any help electricity or ability to leave
9146463 you should also have plastic utensils plastic or paper plates and plastic or styrofam cups because you may not be able to use hot water to wash dishes if the electricity is out
9146464 if you have babies or infants make sure you have enough water for their formula needs if theyre taking formula also have enough baby food for them
9146465 overall it will feel very even it will have an easier approach not so much glare
9146466 nowadays you catch a lot of glare we break it down and have good glare control
9146467 to give you an idea we can reduce energy consumption at each street lamp by about 25 to 30 percent immediately thats just one to one comparison
9146468 we also have the energy savings because of the control systems you can turn it on turn it off dim it down as the ambient lighting increases or decreases
9146469 if you ask the city theyre probably changing out some light somewhere every day that will go away
9146470 so now you have labor savings and the cost of fuel driving around finding all these broken lights that is a significant saving and i believe that is if not larger than the energy savings its equal to it

9146476 he still has a couple of mistakes here and there but hes always around the ball linehan said of culberson who is battling veteran chris draft for the starting spot at strong side linebacker
9146477 i think we just have a great situation where i think we have four starting linebackers draft being the most versatile of all three in a lot of ways were not naming a starter at this point but i think q is making a pretty good statement at this point for playing time at that position
9146478 it hit me last year after i made the team culberson said

9146487 i got a buzz cut and you want to compare it to a flat top its not even close its night and day
9146488 bad year last year 3 13 they had a lot of problems on offense and a lot of problems on defense pretty much across the board in my mind marc bulger is a very good quarterback very accurate can really throw the football hard to throw the football when youre under siege which he was last year and i think in great part the reason for that is the injuries in the offensive line and that started with the loss of orlando pace at the beginning of the season that had kind of a ripple effect in their protection and then subsequently in their run game and then marc bulger taking a beating its interesting theyve brought in al saunders to run the offense and scott linehan being an offensive coach can now focus more on being the head coach well i feel like they can have a better defensive front front seven obviously they drafted my son with the no 2 pick hes the rookie as coaches mentioned yesterday rookies tend to have peaks and valleys as he is in the process of having right now
9146489 i cant even walk in a straight line anymore i feel like im on a boat

9146512 there is a real determination in the party to take a big step forward over the next couple of years and in particular to elect the first green mps at the next general election i am excited about playing a central role in this particularly as the norwich south constituency is one of the best prospects in the country for a breakthrough into westminster the green party is already in first place across the norwich south constituency on local election vote share we need to repeat this at the general election to defeat charles clarke
9146513 at a time of rising fuel prices and increases in the cost of living green policies have a lot to offer the british public we support a free insulation scheme to help tackle fuel poverty large scale investment in clean renewable energy and the development of cheap reliable public transport we need action to create a more localised economy to secure more local jobs but also to help reduce the distances that goods are transported this will reduce carbon emissions and also mean that our food and other essential goods are less dependent on fossil fuels the prices of which are rising fast it is important that we reduce packaging on goods for the same reasons it is time that the government introduced taxes on packaging
9146514 its a tremendously exciting conference because of the big change that is coming this year with the green party getting itself a leader for the first time its wonderful for east anglia that adrian ramsay my fellow councillor from norwich is going to hopefully become the inaugural deputy leader of the party it reflects very well on green achievements in this part of the country
9146515 i am hoping to win the support of conference for some important policy changes this year for example i am proposing a motion to reduce societys reliance on the major banks for providing the country with money the fiascos of the last year show clearly that a different basis is needed for banking and finance it should be the government not private banks like northern rock that takes the lead on the control of money
9146516 im also proposing a change in policy that would commit the green party to backing a longer british summer time period leading to us all being able to enjoy more of our waking hours while the sun is up i really hope that that will happen it wouldnt be before time
9146517 thatcher did more damage to the west midlands than the luftwaffe
9146518 the fact that the act restricts more than nonstate funds demonstrates that the design and intent of the law is more than just a state spending decision but also a political statement of condemnation of the designated countries

9146551 were here at solomons house where he has just chosen a royal blue tie for todays make it or break it meeting what do you think of the selection jim
9146552 definitely two snaps down paula i know his names solomon but this is a meeting not a coronation he needed to show he was out for blood so the maroon silk tie was the obvious choice solomon definitely missed the mark on this one
9146553 today at the jones residence we have witnessed a recycling tragedy solomon is apparently not going green and has no intention to do so what impact will that have on the environment steve
9146554 we might as well start dressing in ice packs right now suzy because solomon jones has just single handedly sped up global warming by 10 years arrest him
9146555 i cant believe what our hidden cameras have just uncovered mary solomon jones is apparently driving from one gas station to another with the gas light on looks like hes dare i say it trying to save a dollar
9146556 you mean hes trying to find gas below 3 50 is he a lunatic barry
9146557 apparently so mary im really at a loss for words on this one and you know im never at a loss for words
9146558 barry if solomon continues this crazy quest for gas below 3 50 especially with the gas light on hes gonna tear up his car and wreck his marriage
9146559 youre right mary and not only that studies have shown that people who drive with the gas light on are 10 times more likely to step on bugs he probably kicks puppies too

9146571 the flip side of that is youre working on a cable budget about 2 million per episode rather than broadcasts 2 5 million or more how do you make that work without sacrificing good content i think you do sacrifice something you know you figure out how to make adjustments fundamentally youre still telling complex stories with interesting characters and youre raising complex questions what you may have to give up on here and there is a certain level of production value which if you do what we hope were doing well is something the viewer wont actually miss this is a show which because of budget constraints really doesnt allow us to go outside very much so its an interior show but because its a courtroom drama you sort of belong inside i havent seen to many outdoor courtrooms

9146578 there were more men than women due to a post war immigration program that favoured men however 30 years later the odds have shifted dramatically in 1976 australia had 54 000 more men than women aged in their 30s but by 2006 the excess of young men had turned into a deficit of 9000

9146589 the touchstone is the question of originality and creativity what we believe can be protected need not necessarily be novel but it has to be original and i am convinced that this will ultimately reward any and every chefs creativity and to the extent that they can protect them they should
9146590 i certainly dont know of any cases in the uk relating to the copyrighting of menu descriptions or layout the law in the uk is very clear about his and no artist whether painter writer or musician needs to affix a small c to their work as the copyright automatically belongs to them in the same way the originality of the design and layout of a menu automatically belongs to the restaurateurs take the menu at the wolesley for example as long as its owners have bought the design outright from whoever created it then that menu is theirs im sure that there is a fair amount of copying of menu ideas but every industry has its different attitudes towards this type of thing and it can probably be resolved without going anywhere near a court of law
9146591 and i think its going to be more profound and long lasting than people thought
9146592 weve got our work cut out this coming 12 months will be the most difficult 12 months the
9146593 weve got to rediscover that zeal which won three elections and that is a huge problem for us at the moment
9146594 there has been no improvement in the ground situation so far hence the conditions are still not conducive for resuming work today
9146595 we would move whatever the cost to protect our people
9146596 i cant bring our managers and their families to west bengal if they are going to be beaten if there is going to be violence constantly
9146597 if the house of tatas can face such resistance the much needed fresh wave of industrialisation in the country could suffer

9146599 it will take a maximum of two months for zardari and others to get acquitted from all the cases and that too through a legal process
9146600 i believe some close aides of zardari have made the restoration of justice iftikhar an issue out of personal ego and consistently urge him asif zardari not to restore him

9146678 most models do not incorporate all products traded by the firm firms initially included products they believed presented the highest risk to them with the intent of including other credit sensitive products at some future date some firms do not have the ability to calculate and monitor aggregate exposure limits across all product lines in a var based environment for instance some firms only include derivative and foreign exchange transactions and not repurchase agreements mortgage backed securities and forwards a firms inability to evaluate exposures across all product lines could considerably underestimate credit exposure during periods of extreme market volatility

9146831 das wichtigste war jemanden zu finden der die n chsten zwei jahre finanziert wir sind ganz zufrieden und m ssen jetzt noch einige sachen erledigen
9146832 dann w rden wir mehr informationen bekommen die wir dringend brauchen um zu yamaha honda und ducati aufzuschlie en
9146833 als zweiter auf die piste zu gehen ist definitiv besser als in diesen heftigen pr fungen erster zu sein
9146834 mit einem r ckstand von 28 sekunden blieb uns gar nichts anderes brig als vollgas zu geben
9146835 als zweiter auf die piste zu gehen ist definitiv besser als in diesen heftigen pr fungen erster zu sein
9146836 die heutige etappe ist gut f r uns gelaufen und s bastien konnte in der vorletzten pr fung die f hrung bernehmen aber in absprache mit seb entschieden wir dass er die besten siegchancen hat wenn er morgen nicht als erster auf die piste geht
9146837 es war ein harter tag aber ich bin durchgekommen und die abst nde sind nicht allzu gro
9146838 aber ich bin in einer guten position und alles was ich machen kann ist morgen schneller zu sein als alle anderen es wird echt spannend und ich kann es kaum erwarten ich habe eine gute startposition aber loeb hat eine noch bessere deshalb wird es schwierig wenn ich mir h tte meine position aussuchen k nnen dann hatte ich mich f r platz vier entschieden
9146839 wenn ich mir h tte meine position aussuchen k nnen dann hatte ich mich f r platz vier entschieden
9146840 es ist ein tolles gef hl an der spitze zu bernachten aber es k nnte mir morgen einige schwierigkeiten einbringen ich wollte loeb einholen und hatte erwartet in den top 3 zu sein aber nicht in f hrung zu liegen aber ich darf mir keine gedanken dar ber machen dass ich als erster auf die piste muss mentale st rke ist jetzt gefragt es wird ein enger fight vielleicht wird die rallye wie letztes jahr als ford mit 0 3 sekunden vorsprung gewonnen hat es wird eine echte herausforderung
9146841 es dauert schon seine zeit bis alle unterschriften get tigt sind der konzernname kawasaki heavy industries sagt ja schon aus mit welch gro en m hlen wir es zu tun haben
9146842 es rgert mich einen gro artigen champion wie ihn in valencia nicht unter den ersten zehn gesehen zu haben
9146843 i got income and food i got enough from the farm
9146844 they dont realize that at very low cost just a few dollars you can save childrens lives
9146845 trotzdem ist unser ergebnis von valencia kein grund zur entt uschung wir haben 13 punkte erzielt was den trend der letzten drei rennen davor fortsetzt in den vier rennen seit silverstone haben wir 55 von 72 m glichen punkten gesammelt und dabei den abstand zur tabellenspitze in der konstrukteurswertung von 33 auf acht punkte reduziert
9146846 die ersten vier der fahrer wm liegen innerhalb von 15 z hlern
9146847 das ist eine spannende ausgangsbasis f r das saisonfinale in den bisherigen zw lf rennen siegten f nf verschiedene fahrer aus drei teams neben dem notwendigen speed zum gewinnen wird naturgem die zuverl ssigkeit der technik die allerwichtigste rolle spielen in beiden punkten m ssen wir first class sein und daran arbeitet jeder im team hart und konzentriert
9146848 wir haben absolutes vertrauen in unsere kollegen von mercedes benz an der leistung der motoren und ihrer zuverl ssigkeit gibt es nichts auszusetzen
9146849 allerdings zeigen die j ngsten motorsch den von ferrari in ungarn und valencia dass auch die homologierten motoren anf llig sein k nnen und wir wissen dass zuverl ssigkeit keine selbstverst ndlichkeit ist
9146850 gerade auf strecken die f r die motoren so anspruchsvoll sind gibt es immer ein gewisses risiko
9146851 da wir noch keinen au erplanm igen motorwechsel vornehmen mussten g be es f r unsere beiden fahrer in einem solchen fall noch keine zur ckversetzung in der startaufstellung
9146852 weil es im training geregnet hat haben wir das qualifying als test f r unser set up genutzt
9146853 unseres war leider nicht optimal aber jetzt wissen wir was wir f rs rennen ndern m ssen
9146854 das waren an diesem wochenende meine ersten runden auf slickreifen so gesehen haben wir noch das beste daraus gemacht
9146855 ich muss mich bei meinem team bedanken das in der kurzen zeit ein sehr gutes set up gefunden hat das war nicht einfach weil es im training geregnet hat und wir dadurch noch keine runde auf trockener strecke gefahren waren aber solche stadtkurse liegen mir einfach weil man da sehr pr zise am limit fahren muss und nicht den kleinsten fehler machen darf
9146856 zun chst einmal erhalten wir eine detaillierte karte von der fia auf dieser basis beginnen wir mit unserer arbeit wir leiten daraus die ideallinie ab und geben diese mathematisch in den computer ein der computer kann dann an setups und all diesen dingen arbeiten
9146857 wenn wir k nnen dann nutzen wir auch zus tzlich zur verf gung stehende informationen
9146858 einen monat vorher fand dort einen formel 3 rennen und gt rennen statt zudem haben wir video aufnahmen wir schafften es an ein formel 3 auto eine kamera anzubringen und erhielten auch daten ber das auto man nutzt dies um die simulationen zu verbessern auch wenn einem dies nicht alles sagt
9146859 hinzu kommt dass die ingenieure vorzeitig zum rennen reisen so dass wir zeit haben uns die strecke genau anzuschauen
9146860 sie haben dort am mittwoch ein paar runden gedreht zw lf kilometer klingen nicht nach viel aber da haben wir es gesp rt wir tun alles was wir tun k nnen
9146861 um auf die kommende neue strecke zu sprechen zu kommen singapur so kann diese strecke vor dem formel 1 rennen berhaupt nicht verwendet werden es gibt auch keine videos nur durch computer generierte animationen die wir uns schon angeschaut haben zudem haben wir uns auf basis der karte die ideallinie angeschaut aber in singapur ist die vorbereitung etwas schwieriger
9146862 wir k nnen die haftung die uns eine strecke bietet nicht simulieren bevor wir nicht auf ihr gefahren sind es gibt verschiedene messungen die man vornehmen kann so misst bridgestone zum beispiel die rauheit und so weiter
9146863 wir m ssen aus diesem grund in unserer simulation verschiedene haftungs level ber cksichtigen da es sich bei valencia um eine neue strecke handelt haben wir unsere simulation mit relativ wenig haftung durchgef hrt am freitag war ich berrascht denn es war wirklich rutschiger als ich dies erwartet hatte die haftung war bemerkenswert gering niedriger noch als in monaco angesichts des zustandes der strecke war es dann weniger berraschend dass sich die strecke schnell entwickelte gegen ende des zweiten trainings nahm die haftung rapide zu
9146864 es ist aus diesem grund wie in monaco schwierig die ver nderungen am auto zu verstehen man kann sich in die garage setzen ein paar tassen tee trinken und dann wieder auf die strecke gehen und das auto wird schneller sein man muss also wirklich verstehen was da vor sich geht

9146899 we certainly do not think it as a whole equal to p amp p but it has many amp great beauties fanny is a delightful character and aunt norris is a great favourite of mine the characters are natural amp well supported amp many of the dialogues excellent you need not fear the publication being considered as discreditable to the talents of its author
9146900 you may be assured i read every line with the greatest interest amp am more delighted with it than my humble pen can express the excellent delineation of character sound sense elegant language amp the pure morality with which it abounds makes it a most desirable as well as useful work amp reflects the highest honour amp c amp c universally admired in edinburgh by all the wise ones indeed i have not heard a single fault given to it
9146901 i think it excellent amp of its good sense amp moral tendency there can be no doubt your characters are drawn to the life so very very natural amp just but as you beg me to be perfectly honest i must confess i prefer p amp p

9146903 i never read a novel which interested me so very much throughout the characters are all so remarkably well kept up amp so well drawn amp the plot is so well contrived that i had not an idea till the end which of the two would marry fanny h c rawford or edmund mrs norris amused me particularly amp sir thomas is very clever amp his conduct proves admirably the defects of the modern system of education
9146904 there is a particular satisfaction in reading all miss a s works they are so evidently written by a gentlewoman most novellists fail amp betray themselves in attempting to describe familiar scenes in high life some little vulgarism escapes amp shews that they are not experimentally acquainted with what they describe but here it is quite different everything is natural amp the situations amp incidents are told in a manner which clearly evinces the writer to belong to the society whose manners she so ably delineates

9147295 not a single one of the 35 bills in this package are partisan or controversial
9147296 these bills have been passed by the house of representatives and their respective senate committees with overwhelming support from democrats and republicans
9147297 this bill really tries to help women with postpartum depression
9147298 its deplorable that congress continues to support the drug companies over constituents in no way should congress be involved in medical decisions that should be between the doctor and the patient
9147299 i want senator reid to think about how he would feel if he were in my place or manies place manie will have to suffer for the rest of his life i think if you were to ask manie how he felt about this legislation if he were old enough he would consider this far worse than simply controversial
9147300 the guilt and the heartache i feel is unbelievable sitting there looking at your baby and wondering if he is going to live or die i dont think a person can feel any worse the way i felt when i was popping paxil while i was pregnant was nothing compared to this nobody should ever take these pills not even as a last resort
9147301 this bill would really set new mothers up for depression by convincing them its likely to happen as a woman if someone offered me this sort of screening i would say no way and no thank you i feel very strongly that with the potential effect of death this sort of legislation deserves serious investigation
9147302 without acknowledging these effects we are treating people beyond their level of control and then holding them completely responsible when all hell breaks loose congress needs to carefully pursue and consider the truth before even thinking of passing the mothers act

9147309 we are so fragile our cracking bones make noise we are just breakable breakable breakable girls and boys
9147310 i see this question posted with some regularity in the personals so i thought id take a minute to explain things to the ladies out there that havent figured out the answer
9147311 britains broken society that is what is wrong with the country people can see that society is generally getting a lot poorer there is family breakdown drug abuse alcohol abuse persistent unemployment sometimes three generations of families being unemployed labour dont want to admit that there is anything broken about our society at all even after twenty seven children were killed in london last year even after the appalling death of responsible citizens on their doorsteps and in their front gardens people who have only been trying to protect themselves their children or their property every day there is another murder another assault another rape another front page horror story
9147312 weve had all these criminal justice bills and thousands of new laws and i think what we need to recognise is that fighting crime is actually about more than passing new laws of course you need to have the tough penalties on gun and knife crime and burglary and the rest of it but unless you reform the police and get them out from behind their desks unless you get rid of the culture of paperwork and political correctness unless you deal with the issue of drugs on our streets unless you have a broader response to crime addressing the underlying causes like family breakdown unless you start saying no to things to people falling down drunk in the streets to shops selling booze to people underage unless you change that then nothing will change
9147313 i f someone murdered one of my children then emotionally obviously i would want to kill them how could you not but there have been too many cases of things going wrong of the wrong people being executed of evidence coming to light after the execution and sometimes there is just too much of an element of doubt and i just dont honestly think that in a civilised society like ours that you can have the death penalty any more
9147314 obviously circumstances have meant that ive had to spend more time addressing economic issues and the credit crunch and the cost of living but the conservative partys problem wasnt that we were insufficiently pro business or pro markets our problem was people didnt think we had a good vision of society of what constituted good public services of how you actually improve the quality of life and well being its quite clear that sorting out the economic mess we inherit from labour will be a major undertaking but equally we have made clear that social policy will be the focus of our reforms the focus on those social aspects of modern conservatism was right and theyll be a very big part of my premiership if i get elected im going to be as radical a social reformer as mrs thatcher was an economic reformer and radical social reform is what this country needs right now
9147315 its not the only way that couples come together and stay together but it helps people the sense of commitment the fact that youre standing there in front of friends and relatives and saying its not just about me any more its about us its about us together we have commitments to each other i think its a really important thing i am unashamedly pro marriage some people will say youll sound a bit old fashioned i dont care i think its important
9147316 in the end people are not going to get married for a tax break and people are not going to suddenly stop separating because we change the benefits system
9147317 its not just about me any more its about us its about us together we have commitments to each other i think its a really important thing i am unashamedly pro marriage some people will say youll sound a bit old fashioned i dont care i think its important
9147318 the difference in family breakdown risk between married and cohabiting couples is sufficient that even the poorest 20 of married couples are more stable than all but the richest 20 of cohabiting couples
9147319 on average change in marital status increases the risk of default 4 5 times
9147320 why have a rising number of americans defaulted on their mortgage payments in recent years
9147321 when economist darryl e getter of the u s department of housing and urban development set out to answer this question he discovered that the problem was often not chiefly financial but rather marital many of the american homeowners who fall behind in their mortgage payments are experiencing the economic distress occasioned by divorce or separation from a spouse
9147322 whether looking at all households or just at those with normal and unusually high incomes getter finds unusually high default rates for home mortgages among americans who are divorced separated

9147331 tidak akan tergelincir dua kaki anak adam pada hari kiamat hingga ia ditanya tentang empat perkara tentang usianya untuk apa ia habiskan masa mudanya untuk apa ia habiskan hartanya dari mana ia peroleh dan kemana ia belanjakan dan tentang ilmunya apa yang diperbuatkan dengan ilmunya tersebut

9147334 ada dua nikmat yang kebanyakan manusia tertipu di dalamnya kesehatan dan waktu luang kekosongan

9147336 hendaklah bagi seorang penuntut ilmu untuk mengumpulkan ilmu di waktu luang dan semangat yang menggebu gebu masa muda dan ketika tubuh masih kuat ketika keinginan masih menggunung dan kesibukan masih sedikit sebelum tiba hal hal yang tanpa makna
9147337 sebaik baik manusia adalah yang panjang usianya dan baik amalnya dan sejelek jelek manusia adalah yang umurnya panjang namun jelek amalnya
9147338 hari ini adalah hari besar yang allah swt tetapkan bagi ummat islam maka siapa yang hendak menghadiri shalat jumat hendaklah mandi terlebih dahul
9147339 hari terbaik dimana pada hari itu matahari terbit adalah hari jumat pada hari itu adam diciptakan dimasukkan surga serta dikeluarkan darinya dan kiamat tidak akan terjadi kecuali pada hari jumat
9147340 siapa yang mandi pada hari jumat bersuci sesuai kemampuan merapikan rambutnya mengoleskan parfum lalu berangkat ke masjid dan masuk masjid tanpa melangkahi diantara dua orang untuk dilewatinya kemudian shalat sesuai tuntunan dan diam tatkala imam berkhutbah niscaya diampuni dosa dosanya di antara dua jumat
9147341 sesungguhnya pada hari jumat terdapat waktu mustajab bila seorang hamba muslim melaksanakan shalat dan memohon sesuatu kepada allah pada waktu itu niscaya allah akan mengabulkannya rasululllah mengisyaratkan dengan tangannya menggambarkan sedikitnya waktu itu h muttafaqun alaih
9147342 diantara sekian banyak pendapat ada dua yang paling kuat sebagaimana ditunjukkan dalam banyak hadits yang sahih pertama saat duduknya khatib sampai selesainya shalat kedua sesudah ashar
9147343 setiap muslim yang mati pada siang hari jumat atau malamnya niscaya allah swt akan menyelamatkannya dari fitnah kubur
9147344 sedekah pada hari itu dibandingkan dengan sedekah pada enam hari lainnya laksana sedekah pada bulan ramadhan dibanding bulan bulan lainnya

9147865 i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know

9147867 en espa a existen unas 2 600 iglesias evang licas y 2 100 est n registradas en nuestra federaci n el resto no se inscribe bien porque son muy recientes porque est n en proceso de constituci n o porque no quieren
9147868 en el mbito protestante los grupos no necesitan el visto bueno de un obispo o de una jerarqu a para funcionar cualquiera puede crear una iglesia y sa es precisamente nuestra debilidad no podemos evitar excesos al amparo de la libertad lo nico que podemos hacer desde ferede es explicarles cu l es la realidad espa ola y acompa arles en el proceso de constituci n los nicos l mites son la legislaci n espa ola y el evangelio
9147869 prefiero hablar de actividades delictivas o que puedan afectar a la personalidad secta no tiene una connotaci n jur dica pero detr s de algunas iglesias hay actividades que pueden ser perseguidas eso es lo que hay que denunciar se trate de una iglesia o de un club de f tbol

9147871 los reci n llegados tienen un perfil bajo vienen de ecuador de honduras
9147872 los pentecostales suelen ser de clase baja o incluso de mbitos de pobreza extrema arraigan entre los desarraigados aunque los hay tambi n de clase media y alta e incluso ex presidentes como el guatemalteco efra n r os montt
9147873 son bastantes los latinoamericanos que no eran protestantes antes de venir y que se hacen evang licos en espa a es aqu donde experimentan la proletarizaci n y la anomia tampoco faltan creyentes que fervorosos en sus pa ses de origen pierden en espa a su fe puede que por la prosperidad econ mica o por el deseo de ser aceptados
9147874 igual que la realidad cat lica en ee uu se sostiene por la presencia de inmigrantes latinos aqu en espa a podr a afirmarse lo mismo del movimiento evang lico
9147875 las iglesias evang licas han crecido y sus l deres son aut ctonos no es verdad que sean producto de la penetraci n estadounidense la regi n del mundo que m s misioneros tiene es am rica latina y los manda incluso a am rica del norte
9147876 se estima que hay m s de 9 000 misioneros latinoamericanos trabajando en culturas diferentes a la suya 4 000 en asia frica y europa del este
9147877 la religiosidad evang lica latinoamericana es un fen meno creciente y vigoroso

9147879 sus experiencias son menos anodinas autoritarias y fr as que las que suelen tener en la iglesia cat lica incluso cuando el sacerdote procede de medios populares su formaci n le aleja de sus or genes m s que a los pastores pentecostales y la iglesia cat lica cuando se interesa por los pobres adopta una actitud paternalista

9147883 when i arrived i wanted lampard thats no secret i wanted three players two wingers and a player in midfield who could do something different but i couldnt be happier with sulley muntari the ghanaian midfielder signed from portsmouth ive completely forgotten about lampard
9147884 serie a is a marathon by december i expect juventus milan roma and fiorentina to be up there with us by april it will be inter plus two by may well inter will be up there
9147885 is to watch a few premier league games to know the answer to that question is easy
9147886 would have given me lampard to him mourinho for obvious reasons no
9147887 im not like mourinho who has to win to feel secure about what hes doing
9147888 hes right im very demanding of myself i have to win to be happy maybe this is why i have won a lot ranieri doesnt need success to feel secure about the work he has done and maybe thats why at 70 hes only won a super cup and another small cup he probably needs to change his mentality but hes too old to do so
9147889 hes a coach who believes in the work he does and in his own ideas who demands effort collaboration and ability from his players hes convinced that the collective wins he arrived in milan with the objective of leaving indelible memories he wants to win to convince to entertain and to make history
9147890 it wont only be written in the almanacs but will be fixed for ever in the minds of all those who love football
9147891 in 13 or 14 years of playing football i have never done all the pre season preparation on the pitch the first week its hard but then you really fly
9147892 back to my childhood in brazil where you did everything with the ball at your feet its beautiful
9147893 in my career i only had one coach who used similar methods luis cesar menotti at sampdoria in the first five weeks of the season we were going at 2 000 miles an hour but afterwards we could hardly stay on our feet
9147894 in the first 45 minutes against roma in the super cup final we played with fantasy
9147895 we had players with quality playing within an organisation but producing moments of individual skill of great aesthetic beauty i havent seen a more creative player than zlatan ibrahimovic in the last year some players are clever because they play for the fans and some players are stupid because they play for the coach but in the long run its the stupid ones that get picked
9147896 its just another game its the most important game of my life because its the next game but weve worked all week to prepare for it and were ready
9147897 i dont understand this observation whoever said that is not in love with me at chelsea we scored the most goals and won the most matches away from home we played a very offensive and dynamic game
9147898 the country is not ready to accept foreign aid workers
9147899 while the government has been criticised for obstructing the relief effort
9147900 the buddhist monastery the traditional centre of moral authority in most villages here proved to be the one institution that people could rely on for help monasteries in the delta those still standing after the storm were clogged with refugees people went there with donations or as volunteers monasteries that served as religious centres orphanages and homes for the elderly are now also shelters for the homeless
9147901 trucks of rice beans onions clothes tarpaulins and cooking utensils donated from all over burma
9147902 each day shortly after dawn a convoy of trucks or a barge on the rangoon river departs for the delta loaded with relief supplies and volunteers
9147903 the monks have played a very significant role beginning with the opening up of the temples in the delta to offer refuge for the victims this has certainly brought the monks and people closer the monks have won the hearts of the people
9147904 to play a physically violent role would be far from our beliefs

9147914 some think they can save themselves from justice here they are thinking wrongly when we receive information from the british about fugitives here we will arrest them and hand them over to britain
9147915 i just had to see it and make some sense of it and how it can possibly happen how people can get into war
9147916 my overall objective was to really see what happens to people in populations that are caught up in war
9147917 red on white cross but the reverse of it like a colour negative
9147918 like everybody here i had seen this stuff world crisis on tv and for whatever reason i had an interest in international health and human rights and wanted to do something for this important cause
9147919 there were a whole bunch of people that came together to build this organization at the beginning we had no name recognition and people kind of thought it was a slightly crazy idea
9147920 but we had a group of very idealistic people who believed in the cause and wanted to do whatever it took
9147921 kids are important to me theyre pretty much the same all over the world
9147922 when id get up they would come calling me uncle asking for treats
9147923 theres something very very special about cambodia and africa in general people are just so strong so patient and so deep its very unique
9147924 three years ago i just disappeared into the cottage and wrote a first draft and shared it with don coles a governor general award winning poet in canada
9147925 he coles was very supportive and essential in sort of guiding me in terms of the writing in the beginning
9147926 i probably have 50 grumbacher notebooks in my study with my sketches ideas pictures and i relied on some of that
9147927 i write about unusual things and odd things stuff that for whatever reason touched me and shaped me and were impressive
9147928 if the situation gets worse we might have to rent out our new warehouses to other companies
9147929 were suffering a cold winter in the middle of summer
9147930 if youre sitting in beijing youre saying weve already lost two percentage points of economic growth
9147931 thats a big turning point for the chinese economy that means questions of profitability questions of unemployment questions of social stability
9147932 the chinese economy is still beset with problems including persistent prices rises uncertainties in demand abroad squeezed corporate profit margins difficulty in ensuring energy and power supplies and undue expansion of foreign exchanges reserves
9147933 for many of us its hard to raise our prices because the orders from our old clients are based on the earlier cheaper prices
9147934 some people say that the more they produce the more they lose money
9147935 were getting almost no profits from our overseas orders because of the rising cost of material labour and transportation
9147936 american clients are hesitating to send us orders because theyre afraid that they wont be able to sell the furniture and chinese exporters are reluctant to accept the orders because the profit margins are so low
9147937 but over the next several years and i dont know when its going to start the next leg is likely to be down and when the economy declines its not going to be a soft recession
9147938 this is when you discover how dysfunctional this economy was
9147939 with energy prices rising dramatically as a cost component the ability of the chinese economy to keep functioning the way it used to is in severe doubt
9147940 japan went south when non performing loans got to about 20 per cent of gdp south korea about 25 per cent
9147941 these guys chinese are conservatively at 40 per cent of gdp and then they get hit by commodity prices so for china its the perfect storm
9147942 is it going to grow at 12 per cent forever of course not
9147943 but it can grow at 6 to 10 per cent for the next five years most people would be happy with that especially as the base is getting bigger
9147944 we have to spend a lot of money on brand promotion and sales networks to develop the domestic market for our furniture
9147945 we dont have enough experience and expertise in the domestic market and about 50 to 60 per cent of the furniture factories in dalingshan have switched to the domestic market so were facing severe competition its a real headache for all of us here
9147946 back to mississippis shameful past of jim crow segregation police brutality and violence
9147947 have been unfairly incarcerated while fighting for social justice and self determination they are our generations sacco and vanzetti
9147948 although this man may not have committed the crime attributed to him he is nonetheless culpable because he is the enemy of our existing institutions
9147949 episodes of racism and intolerance including institutional racism and intolerance the violation of the human rights of asylum seekers and roma the violation of human rights in prisons and immigrant detention centres the day work and untrammeled exploitation on farms all testify to the importance even today of the fate of the two italian anarchists murdered in america of their cry for freedom dignity and social justice
9147950 it is a history of the sacco vanzetti case truer than the court transcript more real than any non fiction account precisely because it goes beyond the immediate events of the case to bring the reader the historical furnace in which the case was forged it puts the straight lines of neutral type in the law books under a microscope where they show up as rows of trenches in the war of class against class
9147951 it is a well known fact that all italians lie and steal
9147952 the horrible injustices done to sacco and vanzetti are being suffered by all too many people right now sacco and vanzetti make us proud to be human beings and prouder still to be radicals they also force us to recommit ourselves to the struggle for human liberation
9147953 we are disappointed and concerned over north koreas decision to suspend the decommissioning of nuclear facilities in yongbyon

9147970 maybe mccain hit the ball out of the park but it was just a foul ball
9147971 what comes across best is that she looks hot fills a stage seems a fast study and speaks in complete sentences nobodys listening closely to anything anyway so she could pull it off even going toe to toe on the stage with biden in 2008 its all about form over content

9147995 well the recalls therell be a few more as we get out into the secondary processors and some of the third line
9147996 some of this product went out somewhere and other sandwiches were made out of it thats the nature of the recalls as they grow
9147997 the most important information for consumers is as we go out there we are providing further precision that informs them and lets them recognize these products in ways they werent able to do with the initial recall
9147998 it certainly does shake the confidence of consumers to know that its taking this amount of time
9147999 it just demonstrates that our need to make sure that we have absolute vigilance throughout this process is paramount
9148000 to insist harper take immediate action to put inspectors on the floor of meat processing plants
9148001 to very quickly restore the confidence of canadians and more importantly to protect canadians
9148002 in the u s they had a legislated commitment to visit the plants daily
9148003 we took a different approach originally which meant that those tasks were applied by the inspectors spending more time in the plants though not necessarily on a daily basis
9148004 with our system we were able to pick it up with relatively small numbers otherwise it might have gone unnoticed
9148005 it helped us to connect the dots in such a way that we were able to say we have something provincially going on

9148131 nu am v zut niciodat diferen a de v rst m a fascinat personalitatea lui modul elegant de a se comporta i m a f cut s m simt cea mai important femeie din via a lui

9148135 in cazul in care s ar intampla sa nu pot fi gasit sa stie ca il autorizez sa ia decizii in numele meu
9148136 toate mijloacele pe care le avem in dotare si umane si electronice si altele au dovedit ca functioneaza foarte bine si acest lucru ne a permis o informare in timp real a tuturor factorilor decizionali si a presedintiei si a primului ministru asupra tuturor lucrurilor legate de evolutiile din georgia
9148137 cat de important este rolul activitatii de informatii in materie militara
9148138 previzionarea din timp capacitatea de a urmari in mod real ce se intampla este cu atat mai remarcabila cu cat am asistat si in cazul conflictului din georgia la un dublu razboi pe de o parte actiuni militare reale pe care noi le am monitorizat si pe de alta parte la un razboi mediatic de prezentare de catre fiecare dintre cele doua parti a actiunilor care din punctul meu de vedere inca o data va spun dovedesc cat de important este rolul directiei generale de informatii a armatei pe aceste teme
9148139 john mccain was able to weave in his experience in a vietnam prison camp no matter what the question was
9148140 its much better than talking about how hes changed his total character between being a senator a kind of a maverick and his acquiescence in the last few months with every kind of lobbyist pressure that the right wing republicans have presented
9148141 i would hope that the democrats could have enough senators elected in november so that we would not any longer need to include joe lieberman among the senators

9148201 for many people the timing of the raid cannot be justified some think that if the pad really wanted to topple the samak administration they should have stepped up the protest and employed the siege tactic during the preah vihear temple controversy as there would have been more momentum and legitimacy
9148202 the pad remains the strongest and staunchest political pressure group essentially acting as a check and balance for thailands future political reform they are the biggest group with the widest base of supporters and they are fighting against corrupt politicians
9148203 the core concept of the right to disagree with the government should be protected and the most important thing is to avoid instigating the use of force to crush that dissenting voice which might lead to casualties
9148204 it is discouraging and a pity that the pad has recently resorted to violence instigating tactics which is reducing its legitimacy gen pallops involvement will only portray the struggle as being formatted as a war against the other side
9148205 the law is being implemented why does the pad need to catalyse more confrontation it is unfathomable that the pad claims thailand is not ready for democracy any change in the regime should be done through democratic means shouldnt it
9148206 it is not healthy that the core values of pad supporters boil down to only hatred of one person thaksin shinawatra it is irritating and a pity that a democratically elected government is toppled by people on the streets who claim they represent the majority which seems not to be the case

9148225 there is no death as you understand it here on earth when a sepelion has outlived his usefulness as a singular being he becomes one with sepelio and serves to further expand the planet there is no way for us to commit suicide but until we came to earth the thought had never even occurred to us a sepelions life lasts forever whether they wish for their brain to explode or not

9148268 pertemuan pas umno itu adalah ancaman besar buat anwar dan husam maka mereka merancang supaya sebarang usaha mempertemukan pas dan umno akan gagal sama sekali di masa hadapan
9148269 maka bersungguh sungguhlah mereka secara sedar mahupun tanpa disedari mempertikaikan dan menyanggah keputusan majlis syura ulama pas yang mengizinkan presiden dan timbalannya mengadakan pertemuan dengan umno
9148270 manakala tugas terpenting buat husam ialah untuk mempengaruhi tok guru mursyidul am datuk nik abdul aziz nik mat supaya beliau juga tidak bersetuju dengan sebarang bentuk pertemuan di antara pas dan umno
9148271 sebab itulah kita melihat tok guru kita seringkali membuat kenyataan yang agak bercanggah dengan tuan guru presiden dan majlis syura
9148272 cubalah kita bayangkan betapa rendahnya martabat tuan guru presiden menurut kaca mata khalid sehingga di aku engkau kan
9148273 kalimah aku kadang kadang saya gunakan semasa bergurau dengan sahabat handai tetapi tidak sekali kali semasa bercakap dengan mereka engkau saya tidak pernah pakai dan sebaliknya menggunakan awak secara kebiasaan
9148274 dalam mesyuarat adakalanya saya menyanggah pandangan dr dzulkifli adakalanya pandangan husam dan juga sebaliknya itu perkara biasa bagi kami kita ingin mencari keputusan yang terbaik
9148275 saya tahu apa yang berlaku namun saya merasakan masalah yang kita sedang hadapi dalam pakatan rakyat adalah perkara biasa

9148282 atau datuk kamaruddin hanya perlu menerima arahan daripada bos lama datuk iaitu anwar dan husam musa sahaja

9148318 g overnor palin is a tough executive who has demonstrated during her time in office that she is ready to be president she has brought republicans and democrats together within her administration and has a record of delivering on the change and reform that we need in washington
9148319 governor palin has challenged the influence of the big oil companies while fighting for the development of new energy resources she leads a state that matters to every one of us alaska has significant energy resources and she has been a leader in the fight to make america energy independent

9148321 as the head of alaskas national guard and as the mother of a soldier herself governor palin understands what it takes to lead our nation and she understands the importance of supporting our troops

9148466 i want to report to you friends that my imprisonment here has had the opposite of its intended effect instead of being squelched the message has actually prospered all the soldiers here and everyone else too found out that im in jail because of this messiah that piqued their curiosity and now theyve learned all about him not only that but most of the followers of jesus here have become far more sure of themselves in the faith than ever speaking out fearlessly about god about the messiah 15 17 its true that some here preach christ because with me out of the way they think theyll step right into the spotlight but the others do it with the best heart in the world one group is motivated by pure love knowing that i am here defending the message wanting to help the others now that im out of the picture are merely greedy hoping to get something out of it for themselves their motives are bad they see me as their competition and so the worse it goes for me the better they think for them 18 21 so how am i to respond ive decided that i really dont care about their motives whether mixed bad or indifferent every time one of them opens his mouth christ is proclaimed so i just cheer them on and im going to keep that celebration going because i know how its going to turn out through your faithful prayers and the generous response of the spirit of jesus christ everything he wants to do in and through me will be done i can hardly wait to continue on my course i dont expect to be embarrassed in the least on the contrary everything happening to me in this jail only serves to make christ more accurately known regardless of whether i live or die they didnt shut me up they gave me a pulpit alive im christs messenger dead im his bounty life versus even more life i cant lose 22 26 as long as im alive in this body there is good work for me to do if i had to choose right now i hardly know which id choose hard choice the desire to break camp here and be with christ is powerful some days i can think of nothing better but most days because of what you are going through i am sure that its better for me to stick it out here so i plan to be around awhile companion to you as your growth and joy in this life of trusting god continues you can start looking forward to a great reunion when i come visit you again well be praising christ enjoying each other 27 30 meanwhile live in such a way that you are a credit to the message of christ let nothing in your conduct hang on whether i come or not your conduct must be the same whether i show up to see things for myself or hear of it from a distance stand united singular in vision contending for peoples trust in the message the good news not flinching or dodging in the slightest before the opposition your courage and unity will show them what theyre up against defeat for them victory for you and both because of god theres far more to this life than trusting in christ theres also suffering for him and the suffering is as much a gift as the trusting youre involved in the same kind of struggle you saw me go through on which you are now getting an updated report in this letter

9148597 it is through this coordinated effort that the fire was contained
9148598 some of the affected people had already moved in with relatives and friends in the neighbourhood
9148599 me doli mucho en un momento pero eso me ayud a ser un poco m s agresivo para no correr tanto
9148600 i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president
9148601 i come here as a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the center of my world theyre the first thing i think about when i wake up in the morning and the last thing i think about when i go to bed at night their future and all our childrens future is my stake in this election
9148602 and barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
9148603 and barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation because we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
9148604 barack stood up that day and spoke words that have stayed with me ever since
9148605 all of us driven by a simple belief that the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be
9148606 its a belief barack shares a belief at the heart of his lifes work
9148607 thats why hes running to end the war in iraq responsibly to build an economy that lifts every family to make health care available for every american and to make sure every child in this nation gets a world class education all the way from preschool to college thats what barack obama will do as president of the united states of america
9148608 and in the end after all thats happened these past 19 months the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago
9148609 and as i tuck that little girl and her little sister into bed at night i think about how one day theyll have families of their own and one day they and your sons and daughters will tell their own children about what we did together in this election theyll tell them how this time we listened to our hopes instead of our fears how this time we decided to stop doubting and to start dreaming
9148610 so tonight in honor of my fathers memory and my daughters future out of gratitude to those whose triumphs we mark this week and those whose everyday sacrifices have brought us to this moment let us devote ourselves to finishing their work let us work together to fulfill their hopes and let us stand together to elect barack obama president of the united states of america
9148611 before we get into foreign policy senator biden many question your ethical integrity because though a catholic you support abortion governor palin on the other hand a woman and mother of five including one child with down syndrome is a staunch opponent how do you square your hypocrisy with her sincerity
9148612 governor palin much has been made of your lack of washington foreign policy experience especially compared to that of your opponent senator biden but wouldnt you agree just as the obama campaign has said on numerous occasions that what matters more than beltway experience in dealing with international crises is sound character common sense and judgment which you clearly possess as a mother of five children including one child serving in the armed forces now
9148613 yes i remember when barack obama came down here from his fancy school to work as an organizer but it wasnt the obama you hear about in all the speeches and commercials he was only doing the work for himself and for how far it would get him in his career and not for the people out here in fact while the other organizers lived here in the neighborhood obama was staying in a fancy hotel uptown drawing a paycheck from his fancy law firm we need a leader like john mccain who means what he says and says what he means and wont sell out his own people to get ahead
9148614 animal crossing features three themes family friendship and community but the reason i wanted to investigate them was a result of being so lonely when i arrived in kyoto chiba is east of tokyo and quite a distance from kyoto and when i moved there i left my family and friends behind in doing so i realized that being close to them being able to spend time with them talk to them play with them was such a great important thing i wondered for a long time if there would be a way to recreate that feeling and that was the impetus behind the original animal crossing
9148615 youll also be able to do more than ever together when you play online youll be able to experience events or see concerts together for example and while in the ds version we discarded a lot of events that were popular in the gamecube version were bringing them back were including halloween were bringing back jingle the reindeer that visits during the holiday event and weve got some new events too for example during spring weve got a special visitor who brings paint and eggs so you can have an egg hunt and we also have a carnival thatll introduces another new character to the animal crossing world

9148641 we have absolutely nothing with us here we left everything behind
9148642 this will gyrate the whole industry to look at mocca differently it would gyrate more other agents to look at it and say hey look the time to be on the internet is now and if a leading agency as big as hsr has come on that says something about mocca and its movement
9148643 the real estate agents of the 21st century have to be using the internet and the best system we can use on the internet is mocca dot com because through mocca dot com we can not only list our property we can give a lot more information

9148662 acknowledge again and explicitly that this nation remains engaged in an armed conflict with al qaida the taliban and associated organizations who have already proclaimed themselves at war with us and who are dedicated to the slaughter of americans
9148663 im not prepared to say its a game changer vice presidents almost never determine election results but it does some positive things for mccain including building some interest in a republican convention in labor day week that might have been ignored
9148664 mccain picked someone whos younger and has less experience than obama to be a heartbeat away from a 72 year old president
9148665 we just dont know how shell handle the next nine weeks of campaigning dealing with all these complicated national and international issues debating obamas running mate joe biden and having every word scrutinized by an aggressive press corps
9148666 if mccain thinks this ultra conservative lifelong member of the nra is going to substitute for hillary clinton he doesnt get it
9148667 to him i guess women are all interchangeable he assumed people would vote for her just because shes a woman
9148668 shes a mother shes young she knows where shes been and what shes doing and her sons in the iraq war
9148669 shes pro life anti gun control really the ideological opposite of hillary im not sure how many nonideological clinton voters there are to attract
9148670 one of our weak points has been working moms stay at home moms soccer moms
9148671 i think shes going to really connect with people in the four counties surrounding philadelphia im hopeful that shell spend a lot of time in the philadelphia suburbs doing retail campaigning

9148883 what happened last saturday was not arsenal and we needed to show it could not happen again
9148884 you take in the criticism but the key is that we knew ourselves we were rubbish and that we could have done so much better now we need to show our real selves and we did well against twente
9148885 we knew that we did not put in the needed performance at fulham
9148886 but what happens in between games is not so important the crucial thing is to respond well in the next game which we did
9148887 now we have another big game against newcastle and we need another response to what has happened before

9148895 what did he have four hits tonight its just another day for dustin pedroia i dont think it impresses anybody anymore
9148896 he didnt seem like the kind of guy that would be mad about it
9148897 the only thing i care about is us winning games ill go 0 for 4 and have us win any day of the week
9148898 he just does it all the time hes a great hitter but when he doesnt hit he does all those other things every night he plays the game until its over like its his last game
9148899 yeah weve got to do the little things to win but weve got guys to do the little things
9148900 hes just a good baseball player hes just a very good baseball player and a good teammate
9148901 now if he hit 220 it might not go as well
9148902 but hed still conduct his business the same way and thats a compliment to him
9148903 yeah we have to do the little things to win but we have guys to do the little things
9148904 guys run the bases well and we can hit and run and we can bunt and we can do all those things to win games but the key is pitching daisuke was outstanding and thursday jon lester was outstanding if we get pitching performances like that were going to win games
9148905 this is a little bit of a rapid ascent but i think we all feel our development people especially that he can handle whatever comes at him its an exciting day for the organization
9148906 we walked one guy then we hit another guy then the gates open
9148907 javy threw the ball better than will show up in the box tomorrow
9148908 i think he threw the ball good he was in trouble early in the game after that he settled down and we didnt make a couple of plays for him
9148909 daisuke threw the ball really well and it was well needed when youre facing a guy like vazquez
9148910 matsuzaka gets his pitch count up and its hard to keep him in extended innings but he was more efficient today even better than he was in toronto he had good stuff
9148911 today he ran into contact earlier in the count and you cant always force that because it depends on the hitters but that helped him he was strong he had a good fastball and it complemented his slider and cutter and mixed in just a couple of changeups
9148912 he threw more strikes today hes always throwing high counts but today he threw strikes and we were flailing for it he threw the ball good youve got to give him some credit
9148913 we got players and guys who know what to do and so we go from there

9148916 climate warming is also coming larger and faster than the models are predicting

9148918 it also means that climate warming is also coming larger and faster than the models are predicting and nobodys really taken into account that change yet
9148919 it is apparent that the stage of disease incubation in infected donors played a large role in the likelihood of transmission the longer that bse or scrapie had been carried by donors the greater the likelihood of the disease being transmitted with transfusions of infected blood
9148920 the study shows that for sheep infected with bse or scrapie transmission rates via blood transfusion can be high particularly when donors are in the later stages of infection
9148921 while it may not correlate directly to what happens in the human population due to factors such as species differences in genetic susceptibility to disease it provides greater insight into the role of how vcjd may be carried through infected blood by understanding how vcjd can be transmitted through blood transfusions we can ensure the most effective control measures to minimise human to human infection
9148922 these results attest to the solid performance posted by ranaz in the second quarter in terms of both sales and operations

9148937 we lived in the same dorm on the same floor and both realized early on that the film program was kind of silly and ridiculous
9148938 just for fun and as a creative outlet from our normal lives
9148939 actually watched it and called tim on his cell phone to say he liked it bob was literally our idol at that point and from then on he held our hands and helped us develop a tv show and pitch it to the cartoon networks adult swim
9148940 we originally pitched the tim and eric awesome show before tom goes to the mayor because little videos were what we did tom goes to the mayor was just one of the weird videos that happened to be animated so adding all the little commercials and things in actually made it feel more natural than doing the cartoon those were always the high energy points of the series and i think thats what inspired us to change the format and just do a full sketch show
9148941 some strange talent show that should never be on tv featuring the worst outtakes and performances youve ever seen
9148942 make the show feel very ambiguous in time so that you wouldnt attach the show to contemporary times
9148943 it also came from tim and i editing the stuff on our own not knowing how to edit for a green screen or add text which in turn makes it looks like public access by accident
9148944 they just make us laugh and we think they are the most unique interesting funny people in the world
9148945 we have a good relationship with these guys and they have a blast being on the show
9148946 when you think about wii music you have to forget everything you know about music games
9148947 the whole premise is a bit of a play on make guns not war its also to show the lighter side of hacking and the hacktivist mentality

9148949 we have a tsunami of an aging population across the country and around the world
9148950 the same kind of positive impact on creativity and the brain and engagement and creativity that holds true for children we now know holds true for adults so we want to have parallel programs for adults in music in the arts in new media in technology
9148951 the whole field of adult education uses a teaching style that is very empowering
9148952 rather than a full year there are many courses that are only six weeks so people can get a taste there are also one day institutes
9148953 im very eager to take the virtual music course which is technology composition online im also very eager to take some of the media arts courses i want to be much more fluent with creative technology
9148954 we now have the scientific research to prove what weve always known intuitively as educators and that is a real win win
9148955 were finding that when we use the arts in multicultural classrooms there is a greater degree of collegiality among the students because there is another way of understanding one another
9148956 in england where our program works in inner city london were finding what teachers really value is how the students are learning to communicate with each other and really value one another
9148957 i love to work this way because i get to work with people i would never otherwise work with and ive begun to understand them better
9148958 the pride they feel in their artwork somehow spills over in taking risks in talking about it
9148959 the teacher and i both looked at each other and thought wow where did that come from
9148960 do they have a case no not really i am convinced that if it went to court the copyright claim would get thrown out completely the trademark perhaps not but if i changed the name to e g trys that would be much harder for them to argue

9149044 this you are there epic about the rise and fall of latin revolutionary che guevara delivered in two parts doesnt just kill with verisimilitude but also because soderbergh and screenwriter peter buchman went for something fuller and deeper certainly more trustworthy than a well oiled hollywood drama with movie moments

9149083 paul has had a decent start and i am pleased that someone has been promoted from the lower leagues to the premier league
9149084 that was the normal route finishing as a player and going into the lower leagues to cut your teeth then get moved up

9149209 alleen zaken die gespecialiseerde schoolbenodigdheden aanbieden en die zich onderscheiden van de ketens door ook andere producten aan te bieden kunnen het hoofd boven water houden
9149210 35 procent van de handelaars probeert zich te onderscheiden door meer fantasieartikelen en producten aan te bieden zo is de kans kleiner dat een kind met hetzelfde naar school gaat als zijn klasgenootjes
9149211 handelaars proberen om klanten te lokken door ook artikelen in te kopen die de tekenacademie in de buurt vraagt

9149220 all of a sudden we saw the smoke and small flames coming out near the engine area and the driver instead of stopping told the passengers to fan the smoke

9149225 nvidia lijkt een zeer goed concept in ontwikkeling te hebben dat een belangrijke en unieke applicatie zou kunnen worden voor pc gaming de huidige consoles beschikken niet over de paardenkracht om tegelijkertijd twee frames van een high end game te renderen maar het is niet langer onbetaalbaar om een pc te bouwen die dat wel makkelijk kan
9149226 neem bijvoorbeeld unreal tournament iii een zeer gedetailleerde game met veel actie op het scherm deze game loopt op een resolutie van 1280x720 met 30 frames per seconde op de consoles dit zou door het toepassen van s 3d omlaag gaan naar 15 frames per seconde en wordt er dus niet leuker op op een degelijke pc zal het echter makkelijk op een hogere frame rate kunnen lopen en dus een zeer goede s 3d ervaring geven

9149261 during everyday life we constantly evaluate social behaviour and this largely affects how we feel about ourselves and other people
9149262 but the way we store and use information about our own and other peoples social behaviour are not well understood
9149263 this latest study used functional brain imaging to identify the circuits in the brain that underpin our ability to differentiate social behaviour that conforms to our values from behaviour that does not
9149264 the most distinctive feature of depressive disorders is an exaggerated negative attitude to oneself which is typically accompanied by feelings of guilt
9149265 now that we understand how the brains of healthy individuals respond to feelings of guilt we hope to be able to better understand why and where there are differences in brain activity in people suffering from or prone to depression
9149266 the brain region we have identified to be associated with proneness to guilt has been shown to be abnormally active in patients with severe depression in several previous studies but until now its involvement in guilt had been unknown
9149267 by translating these basic cognitive neuroscience insights into clinical research we now have the potential to discover new key functional anatomical characteristics of the brain that may lie behind depressive disorders
9149268 the results will hopefully make an important contribution to our understanding of the causes of depression that will ultimately allow new approaches to find better treatments and prevention

9149276 i think its really important to learn to feed yourself with seasonal vegetables
9149277 i think people are more aware about food safety issues and are fed up eating any old rubbish if you do a simple calculation of how much it costs to eat organic food from either migros or coop supermarkets its quite expensive and the quality is quite poor if you do an annual calculation here we are definite winners
9149278 we have lots of friends who receive cocagne vegetables or those from other cooperatives and more and more people seem interested lots of similar associations have sprung up in a short period of time
9149279 i wanted to eat products grown near where i live its totally absurd to transport products from one side of switzerland or europe to the other

9149297 is trying to stir up again the politics of fear by reminding people of something they havent really forgotten that we are engaged in serious armed conflict with al qaida
9149298 but the question is where is that conflict to be waged and by what means
9149299 as sept 11 2001 recedes into the past there are some people who have come to think of it as kind of a singular event and of there being nothing else out there
9149300 in a way we are the victims of our own success our own success being that another attack has been prevented
9149301 we believe that the executions were an isolated incident and not part of a strategy to destabilise the state

9149350 we have a tsunami of an aging population across the country and around the world
9149351 the same kind of positive impact on creativity and the brain and engagement and creativity that holds true for children we now know holds true for adults so we want to have parallel programs for adults in music in the arts in new media in technology
9149352 the whole field of adult education uses a teaching style that is very empowering
9149353 rather than a full year there are many courses that are only six weeks so people can get a taste there are also one day institutes
9149354 we now have the scientific research to prove what weve always known intuitively as educators and that is a real win win
9149355 were finding that when we use the arts in multicultural classrooms there is a greater degree of collegiality among the students because there is another way of understanding one another
9149356 in england where our program works in inner city london were finding what teachers really value is how the students are learning to communicate with each other and really value one another
9149357 i love to work this way because i get to work with people i would never otherwise work with and ive begun to understand them better
9149358 the pride they feel in their artwork somehow spills over in taking risks in talking about it
9149359 the teacher and i both looked at each other and thought wow where did that come from
9149360 the important myth to bust is if your kids a decent responsible kid theyve got a decent profile online thats what we call in math a weak correlation
9149361 it is absolutely vital that young people understand that they need to take control of how much personal information they disclose online
9149362 a resum is no longer the piece of paper you send
9149363 its your top 10 results when they google search your name
9149364 but when someone is evaluating you online they dont have to believe it beyond a reasonable doubt they just have to believe it enough not to take a risk on you when theres someone else out there with the same qualifications
9149365 it wasnt that it was any better than sending an email or anything like that it was that they students seemed more willing to accept that media over the other ones
9149366 what i tried to do was not to make it just something to study but to make it something practical so i tried to incorporate as much communication technology in the course as possible
9149367 we are living in a fishbowl but we dont understand the implications of that fishbowl effect yet and thats the facebook concern
9149368 there are many other options for educators to post resources to students
9149369 i dont doubt that you have raised a fine civic minded son or daughter but some of the children who move onto this block are not so fortunate
9149370 some of these young men and women have not been taught how to properly dispose of their trash and look what it does to our street im certainly glad to have a new neighbour like junior here who was brought up to think of others and who knows how improperly disposed of garbage can lead to infestation
9149371 if you see an old man on your lawn shaking his head at your garbage thats me if you get fined by the garbage inspector it was me who dimed you out if there are torn bags ramen noodles and pizza crusts on your lawn attracting vermin then smarten up
9149372 youre old enough to vote drink and rent a car learn how to take out the trash
9149373 thered be a schedule but if it got missed the week before if youre the one after that youre like im not taking out a months worth of garbage no one wants to be the one who takes all the garbage out
9149374 we had to have an exterminator come more than once we have rat traps in the kitchen

9149382 while we may be a very big city were still just a city and for the resources needed to cut poverty in new york city you would absolutely need the federal government to take the lead on that kind of a strategy but that doesnt mean we believe that cities should sit and watch quietly as reality unfolds around

9149390 we send these projects home and we dont know whos done them
9149391 and we dont know what the family life is like we had a student a girl who at 12 went home from school took her siblings home and her mom was passed out on the floor
9149392 her job was to make sure the younger ones didnt wake mom up she had to feed them she had to get them to bed and the next day shes in detention because she didnt do her homework thats where we are coming from with an inner city school
9149393 weve got kids with a certain home life and we are making it worse by sending work home we have to accept the responsibility that we are perpetuating and extending the gap between the have and the have nots
9149394 theyll talk about a math problem and how they arrived at an answer
9149395 say billy gets a completely wrong answer the teacher will say well how did you get that and he has to explain it the conversation is more about critical thinking rather than just doing heres the formula plug in the numbers and heres the answer
9149396 our job is to teach children thats not the parents job
9149397 homework creates a conversation with your kids and with the teacher
9149398 when it was eliminated we felt that communication was broken so when the first report card came home all of a sudden we were saying wow i didnt know there was an issue there and we were backtracking because it was too late

9149404 its my first appearance before such a big crowd its a really great experience to play on my birthday on this court in a night session against andy roddick
9149405 this year was difficult because i couldnt really take tournaments off

9149409 i was really excited to be announced as the young slimmer of the year in my area so to make it through to the national stages was brilliant
9149410 there were 30 of us there at the final and i made it into the last six and it was great to meet ryan hes a really confident bloke and shared some great stories with us
9149411 it was amazing when i found out adam and myself were representing the 29 groups in cumbria and 5 500 groups nationwide meeting ryan was brilliant he was interested in all our stories and gave me a hug hes even more gorgeous in real life than on the tv
9149412 what they have achieved at such a young age is phenomenal
9149413 its so inspiring to meet young people who have transformed their lives and health in such a positive way
9149414 whenever problems like this occur whether it be in a residential area retail park or here on an industrial estate it still takes time and expertise to assess the problem and address it
9149415 the generator we sourced is extremely rare and extremely large it certainly wasnt easy for the team to source and transport this piece of equipment in such a short space of time
9149416 i am grateful for their efforts and the efforts of all the other organisations involved to address this issue as speedily as possible
9149417 im feeling less and less happy as the time moves on and it isnt over yet
9149418 i didnt find out i was pregnant until i was five months gone it was really scary my whole life was put on hold i felt like id wasted it
9149419 chloes worth it though shes six now and ive got scott whos three with this course as well i cant believe i did so well ive just done things a bit back to front
9149420 i was never that good at school when youre there youre too busy thinking about what youre going to do that night and what youre going to wear its not until you get a bit older that you realise
9149421 i was a bit apprehensive about going back to college when most of the others there were 16 i felt a bit old but we had a good laugh
9149422 the kids enjoy going to nursery and after school club so that helps but its hard to do homework at night when ive to keep an eye on them and feed them and bathe them
9149423 i dont have the time or energy for a social life youve just got to think about what youre doing it for
9149424 i want to become a primary school teacher specialising in it
9149425 theyve been brilliant as have my tutors they let me have time off no questions asked when chloe was ill
9149426 results have got better year on year and this time have been outstanding
9149427 but weve never had a student get a double a grade on the course before rachel works very hard
9149428 i am quite outraged that the mayor thinks it is part of his role to be the moral guardian of keswick he is on a slippery slope
9149429 i know these people and they are top class entertainers in the world of street theatre they have toured all over the world and coached other acrobats
9149430 they have been on tv and pop videos and fly all over the world they are a much sought after act
9149431 their act is controversial but theres nothing illegal about it i know the crown prosecution service wont press charges in fact the audiences in keswick loved it
9149432 i am concerned that the mayor thinks an act which entertained hundreds of visitors is a public order offence they have been performing for 20 years and loved keswick in fact they stayed three days preferring it to edinburgh
9149433 the majority of people in the town support me and the complaints are coming from a minority
9149434 skate nakeds act is cheeky but i defend their right to wear a g string they try to be controversial if it was not appropriate for keswick then they would not earn a living street theatre is self regulating in that if people are no good they dont get paid
9149435 officers can confirm that the three people involved were a family from peterborough
9149436 tragically the 38 year old wife and mother has been pronounced dead police will not be releasing the identity of any of the family members at this stage

9149444 the sending off was unfortunate it was an instinctive thing
9149445 the fact he had already been booked meant he had to go unfortunately
9149446 we understand that he misses the first game in europe which is even more unfortunate
9149447 i cannot deny that zenit deserved to win the game i think that they probably just shaded is a little from us
9149448 the one thing that kept them going was that they had three occasions when they got to the byline in the first 20 minutes and that was a concern for me
9149449 i was obviously looking forward to half time to eradicate that which we did in the second half
9149450 i think in tight games who scores the first goal is in a good position and conceding the first goal right on half time was a bad goal for us
9149451 there was not much in it and we congratulate st petersburg on the victory
9149452 its his first game for three or four months and his first step forwards after his knee operation
9149453 i think with ji sung park you get a good player with a good understanding of the game good movement and he did his job okay
9149454 we played better when we were 2 0 down and made some good chances and when we scored with something like 17 minutes to go we still found time to recover and get back into the game
9149455 in the meeting of latin american cardiologists we will offer participants the possibility to have their eyes tested for early changes of radiation effect that may lead to cataract in future years
9149456 this will allow us to assess retrospectively what radiation dose these cardiologists received and then correlate the data with changes in their lens
9149457 we started training courses for cardiologists in 2004 and so far cardiologists from more than 50 countries have been trained in radiation protection

9149493 es probable ver un juego abierto por la necesidad de triunfo y porque ambos equipos juegan bien
9149494 it was good to come on and get the goal to win it its a great feeling
9149495 we kept on pressing and had a few chances in the first half but we kept on defending well too as weve been doing in training and it paid off
9149496 after we were celebrating a few of the lads were asking why i didnt pull it back but after i scored it doesnt matter
9149497 all of the boys are looking forward to sunday now were all geared up and the win today helps our momentum to take into the italy game
9149498 its a great feeling to be called up for england so ive just got to keep playing well for my club and hopefully i can keep my place in the team
9149499 there was lots of determination and i had set the task for the lads today to first of all come away with a clean sheet and to learn from the mistakes on wednesday
9149500 secondly we wanted to try and put three points on the table and theyve done that
9149501 all in all it was a tough game for us but weve come out on top and it sets it up quite nicely for sundays game
9149502 we had chances but in the first half we were very na ve and we must have been caught offside ten or eleven times
9149503 we spoke about that at half time and we were a little more clever with our runs and more patient when we got through on goal
9149504 to try and break them down is never easy but we stuck to the task and got the result
9149505 i thought jacob started very well on wednesday in the first 30 minutes in particular his link up play was good and he was penetrating behind the back line of portugal
9149506 he didnt score but he had a chance and hit the post so im delighted to see him come on and get the goal he deserved tonight

9149513 i think pressure is very important especially in the first game of the season theyre probably not going to be completely in sync right off the bat i think its important to not let them get into that rhythm i think its very important to get pressure with the front four so we dont really have to blitz
9149514 its always important to get pressure on the quarterback but you cant go into a game just thinking get a lot of pressure because they do an excellent job of running draws you have to be smart see what the tempo of the game is and at that point make a decision about how you want to attack him
9149515 i think weve got to get on their receivers early so they dont have any confidence

9149555 i saw a villager tightly clutching a branch and a snake hanging from another branch of tree nearly half submerged in the floodwater while fleeing my village
9149556 these are some of the worst floods in generations and they present a huge challenge for governments and humanitarian organisations
9149557 it is critical that we get emergency assistance to these people in the coming days
9149558 i sold my goat for just 50 rupees which on any other day could have brought me 2 000 rupees
9149559 i wanted to play a few games with coraki because i thought it would be one of my last opportunities
9149560 i am playing with the sons of the guys that i grew up with and to do that i have had to fairly and squarely park my ego in the back of the car because it is impossible to play the way i used to
9149561 from a physical fitness point of view its fine but after not playing for 10 years there is no way of getting close to replicating what i did when i was captain of the mens hockey side
9149562 im a passenger an absolute passenger at the age of 47 there is no way in the world that i should dominate in the local comp and if i did there would be something drastically wrong with the competition
9149563 there are not too many people who arent associated with hockey
9149564 there has always been a culture there and when i grew up if you didnt play hockey you didnt really fit into the community
9149565 there are four women and two children among the wounded only two or three need surgery others have light to moderate injuries

9149574 angel was in distress and was calling for her midwife
9149575 we had gone through all the birthing classes and done all the research and she was wondering where the hell her midwife was
9149576 it was competently relayed to us that if angel needed to go to the hospital then it would happen early and in the midwifes car
9149577 it had also come to the point where the sort of pain i was feeling and the exhaustion together made me think i am not safe here
9149578 there seems to be a lot of little stories from all over the place
9149579 we still want people to come forward were happy to hear from anyone on the issue of bullying how can we resolve these issues if people dont come forward

9149590 hes just a nice horse normally when you buy throw aways you have to sort out their problems but this horse has had no major treatment
9149591 hes never tackled 1600 metres but i think hell handle it

9149615 est bien que opine lo que desee al respecto de su sentencia en el caso contra el poeta que si es o no valetudinario o que si pueden aplicarle casa por c rcel sin embargo las acciones a seguir en el cumplimiento de lo dictado ya no le corresponden a l el juez competente es el juez local donde inici la causa por eso rojas ya no tiene por qu hablar de lo que l har en contra de cardenal cuando la causa ya no est radicada en su despacho
9149616 a todas luces es una maniobra pol tica del gobierno
9149617 que de alguna y otra manera estamos haciendo se alamientos contra las actitudes arbitrarias
9149618 sali a luz que este juez en alguna medida est implicado con las personas que acusaron a cardenal y desde ah debi haberse inhibido de seguir conociendo esta causa estos fallos llenos de irregularidades afectan la dignidad de las personas y la imagen de la justicia en nicaragua dejando mucho que desear de algunos jueces
9149619 sta es una campa a que no est s lo contra el poeta sino contra todo aquel ciudadano que discrepe con el gobierno por nuestra parte hacemos la cr tica no para desestabilizar sino en busca de una reacci n para que se enrumben las pol ticas econ micas y sociales en bienestar de los nicarag enses

9149628 some authors may frown upon this and out of respect to them i will not post at this time
9149629 ive seen people come close to getting into fist fights over parking spaces on the bell street lot
9149630 i think something like this was bound to happen sooner or later its because of the lack of parking
9149631 blaming the confrontation between the two female students on any kind of perceived lack of parking on campus misses the point having more interstates for example would not eliminate road rage road rage is the result of something else going on
9149632 giving out free money in murfreesboro wouldnt eliminate robbery someone would always want more money than someone else trying to make those cause and effect connections just isnt logical
9149633 part of the university campus master plan is to construct parking decks garages at various places around campus these are planned for several years down the road
9149634 there are as many as six separate structures on the preliminary plan some structures may have three four or as many as six levels this is not for quite some time yet
9149635 were a large university and we have to stress always that there is plenty of parking people have to allow time to park on the perimeter and either walk or take the shuttle buses
9149636 monday and wednesday are probably the heaviest and friday the least heaviest traffic days
9149637 there are 12 800 parking spaces which accounts for 100 acres of parking on campus or about one fifth of the campus parking is available
9149638 we have a lot of new incoming freshman and transfer students who still havent learned the ins and outs of getting around the university
9149639 were basically taking kids who have been in grade school for 12 or 13 years who are used to a certain way of doing things and then we put them on a college campus where they have to manage themselves for the first time and it can often lead to confusion anxiety frustration and in some extreme cases real outbursts
9149640 some students will have to learn that you cant always park in the heart of campus
9149641 i think many of them dont have a really good understanding of where a lot of things are on campus because they are new if they will take time to explore theyll find a lot of potential places to park and other facilities that they might not have known were there too
9149642 i learned on the first day of class that the bell street lot is too hectic
9149643 i park off greenland drive now and walk it it takes a little more time to get to my classes but at least i get the exercise
9149644 a long time ago thats its just easier to park and walk
9149645 ive been here long enough to understand how to play the game
9149646 the way to do that is to not play the game its a lot easier to just stop being lazy park a little farther away and get the exercise
9149647 if they are not a student or faculty member avoid the area and look for alternative routes people should give themselves time to negotiate the traffic if they absolutely have to travel through the area
9149648 what were seeing now is an increase in re enrolling students ones who have been out awhile and have returned to mtsu
9149649 i think its significant were seeing an increase in graduate enrollment and in our returning students that tells us our retention efforts are having an effect
9149650 traditionally correlates with the unemployment rate as the unemployment rate increases we see an increase in students returning to mtsu to retool and retrain
9149651 we have not made a decision for any sort of mass evacuations
9149652 were trying not to pull the trigger too quickly on evacuations
9149653 there may be some shifting in the direction of the storm
9149654 make sure you can take care of yourselves for two or three days
9149655 there are many people in life that will catch your eye but only a few will touch your heart pursue those
9149656 la structure de ladn est partag e par tous les humains 1 2 seulement diff rent dun individu lautre

9149658 quentend dont ce journal par immigr s et quel sont les motifs demprisonnement
9149659 steve logan is a very special person in my life
9149660 he is really the reason i am in college football he gave me my first real break in this profession and all ive learned about offensive football i learned from steve he is a real mentor for me
9149661 he tried everything he could to screw that up and i just wouldnt let him
9149662 i encouraged him to take the leap ask him hell admit it
9149663 obviously we need to win they need to win and you dont want your friends to lose you enjoy seeing them but at the same time somebody is going to win and somebody is going to lose this game we both understand that
9149664 im excited about this football team but i dont know what they are yet as a team we are about to find out
9149665 if you are going to play boston college this is the time to play them
9149666 because i promise you three games down the road that quarterback is going to be light years better than he will be going into this game i just know steve logan he gets three games under his belt with this young man crane will be good in this game but hell be lights out three games from now
9149667 we can confirm that two bodies were recovered last night from the main part of osbaston house maesbrook
9149668 the remains will be examined by a home office pathologist and post mortems are due to be carried out later today to establish the cause of death
9149669 its anyones guess but it seems that the people he owed money to are big companies and i cant see them behind something like this
9149670 det han g r sender ikke et godt signal til alle vores fans m jeg indr mme
9149671 alle spillere i klubben arbejder dobbelt s h rdt og hvis det var mig der var ham ville jeg g re det anderledes hvis jeg var i en klub hvor jeg ikke nskede at v re ville jeg stadig give mig 100 pct for det er s dan at jeg er opdraget
9149672 and we have a team for the future and when it comes to the 2010 world cup in sa we will blend both into what will be our best combination
9149673 it is our prerogative and policy to take bafana games round the country
9149674 we have seen nigeria in action at the olympic games
9149675 it is the moment of embarrassment for those who were spreading propaganda that mr zardari would withdraw his candidature
9149676 and i think its going to be more profound and long lasting than people thought
9149677 weve got our work cut out this coming 12 months will be the most difficult 12 months the labour party has had in a generation quite frankly
9149678 weve got to rediscover that zeal which won three elections and that is a huge problem for us at the moment
9149679 theyve got some talented boys they beat us twice last year we hopefully can do better this year against them but mark hughes is proving to be a very good manager
9149680 weve had two away victories on the spin which has been fantastic but we appreciate for us to have a decent season we have to back up our home form from last year with some decent results away from home
9149681 pay more attention to the french and be a stronger opposition to the ruling power
9149682 france needs us awaits us is looking for us love each other or disappear
9149683 it is important for tottenham not to lose another game they want their first three points in the league so we have some problems we know this
9149684 but this is a big chance for tottenham because it is a derby we need to respect them even more
9149685 we need to start getting points on the board and i think having a game like chelsea at this time gives us a great chance to lift the spirits
9149686 the game plan should be to go there and play with an ambitious attacking style of football without fear
9149687 the team that takes its chances on the day will be the one who prevails
9149688 it is the moment of embarrassment for those who were spreading propaganda that mr zardari would withdraw his candidature
9149689 asif ali zardari will take part in the september 6 presidential election
9149690 if you play chelsea and manchester united in your opening two games it will always be difficult
9149691 harry redknapp has built a really good team peter crouch has been a good signing they have jermain defoe as well who is a threat
9149692 they are strong defensively and pushed us all the way for fifth last season
9149693 as for jerome thomas hes never had a back problem before and we dont know why hes got one now maybe its because of a change of beds since he moved here it could be anything
9149694 we have a top class back specialist here and hopefully he can put him right
9149695 i think the situation is far less serious than what is being portrayed but at the same time certainly something that we are very unhappy about
9149696 i mean people have started comparing it with the 1990s and what not certainly the situation is nowhere around that
9149697 what is causing us concern is that four years of improvement in the situation we believed that we have reduced levels of alienation there were substantial signs of normalcy in the state people had forgotten about issues
9149698 when i arrived in england michael owen was a young boy very promising and he looked absolutely fantastic because he was very quick sharp and intelligent in front of goal
9149699 he is not just a goalscorer he can make assists has good link play makes runs
9149700 owen gets where he needs to be as he reads the game
9149701 you know when you go there the emirates stadium like old trafford and anfield and just about every place in the premiership to be honest youve got to stand up and be counted
9149702 youve got to have the courage to play and whatever team i put out with injuries therell be a lot of personnel missing who would normally play and the other players have got to stand up and be counted
9149703 dean windass just wants to play football i gave him that opportunity at swansea on tuesday
9149704 he said to me he just wants to score goals and he has done that so he is ticking all the boxes
9149705 do i repay him with a start against wigan the answer to that will remain to be seen
9149706 i think chris kirkland should be okay for the hull game
9149707 he had a spasm while we were away in pre season and it tightens up and stiffens up a bit but we dont think it is anything too serious so with a bit of tlc he will be fine
9149708 he has been to see specialists and were okay with him hes comfortable with the whole situation at the moment so we dont think there is really anything to unduly worry us
9149709 i can understand mido will want to play hell be causing me a headache in terms of selection
9149710 at the start of the season it was easy because he hadnt had pre season matches but now he is getting up to full fitness and scoring goals that gives me a problem
9149711 he has had a big impact from the bench and i think he is pushing hard to get in that starting line up
9149712 the villa game has come and gone it was an important win and a great day for the club and it showed the character we have got within the group of players
9149713 but we move on now because weve got to prepare for a very tough game at middlesbrough on saturday
9149714 they were unfortunate to lose at liverpool and the reports im getting is they are a much better team than they were last year
9149715 once things settle down behind the scenes and stabilises then i think the players will be pleased
9149716 but were here to do a job and all that stuff is not really any of our business to be honest
9149717 its happening at the club we play for but its not a lot to do with us and we just have to focus on what were doing
9149718 the department of state is extremely sensitive to your concerns and we are cognizant of the human rights abuses modi has committed
9149719 we have thoroughly searched department records and located no current non immigrant visa applications for modi however should we receive an application we assure you it will be adjudicated in strict accordance with the immigration and naturalisation act
9149720 esperamos que se apoyen las acciones de los emisarios de paz rusos y que a los georgianos esos criminales se les impongan sanciones

9149724 true football people discount the talk that division i aa is way below us i could probably name 10 schools in division i that northern iowa is better than and if we played any of those 10 schools other people would say that it is better than playing northern iowa
9149725 is a situation where when we lost nevada we had to get somebody
9149726 we fought with nevada we wanted to get them to stay stay stay but it was pretty apparent they werent going to play us this year
9149727 now when that was the case i had to look at plan b which was to play a i aa team and i will tell you one thing
9149728 northern iowa is better than quite a few division i teams i am not embarrassed by playing a i aa team and the moniker of being a i aa team and people thinking any less of them is ridiculous
9149729 those are things that are sometimes out of your control but our plan is not to
9149730 we fought with nevada we wanted to get them to stay stay stay but it was pretty apparent they werent going to play us this year
9149731 we practiced in the stadium all week because we wanted to try and simulate the conditions that well be playing under
9149732 we wanted to play underneath the heat as much as we could
9149733 so its a good thing that he knows were not afraid to put diondre in the game
9149734 to come out with a w from the big house would mean a lot to the team
9149735 we have aspirations of a bcs bowl so we need to get a win its a must win
9149736 it didnt do us any favors having appalachian state going in there and whacking them like they did
9149737 it could make this whole season great and help us get where utah needs to be
9149738 men never really ask for anything they command and believe me what you wont do 10 broads around the corner will
9149739 when you go to the grocery store to shop do you pick out the nastiest looking most rotten smelliest fruit or meat you can find
9149740 oh you dont why not its the same with men when they see baby elephant sized out of shape women

9149742 we will not be shipping any more of this product until we have addressed the issue
9149743 american women everywhere will respond to her inspiring story and her willingness to shake up the status quo
9149744 it certainly appears that this choice may bring new energy into the values voters
9149745 they have been largely in a wait and see mode and this choice appears to be for many of them a positive one
9149746 this is a transparent attempt to pick up the voters upset by the perceived snub of hillary clinton
9149747 clinton is an accomplished woman and this woman is not
9149748 i think its an attempt by senator mccain to appeal to female voters
9149749 shes not a household name but welcome to the 21st century
9149750 this is the information age they got on the internet when the news started leaking out they checked her out they like her

9149756 but these instructors teachers in a general sense personnel who trained others to work on the supplied military equipment are supposed to be in training centers and where were they in the military operations zone
9149757 why did the senior us leadership allow their citizens to be present there when they had no right to be in the security zone and if they allowed it i begin to suspect that it was done intentionally to organise a small victorious war
9149758 and if that failed they wanted to create an enemy out of russia and unite voters around one of the presidential candidates of course a ruling party candidate because it is only the ruling party that has this kind of resource
9149759 we have long ago recognised the borders of modern day ukraine
9149760 we have an agreement with ukraine about maintaining the presence of our fleet until the year 2017 and we will implement that agreement
9149761 if i were to say that we dont care that we were indifferent i would be lying

9149772 el agua dada la trascendencia que tiene para la vida humana el agua realmente est dentro de la categor a de los derechos humanos
9149773 comprobamos c mo los recursos naturales son extra dos y contaminados por el ego smo de algunos de intereses de grupos de poder amparados por el actual modelo econ mico en perjuicio de los pobres los campesinos y los ind genas un cuidado especial merece el recurso del agua que empieza a ser escaso convirti ndose en el mediano plazo en fuente de conflictos en el mundo
9149774 ticamente es para nosotros inaceptable sea el proyecto en s mismo que planea construir cinco mega centrales en ays n y consideramos inaceptable la postura del estado frente a estas situaciones que se han ido dando con incluso apoyos p blicos de algunos ministros previo a la presentaci n del proyecto de impacto ambiental
9149775 se plantea un cuestionamiento sereno ya que desde la tica y la espiritualidad surgen una serie de elementos que llevados a la pr ctica nos platean en qu sociedad estamos viviendo como por ejemplo qu modelo econ mico nos rige y qu efecto tiene en las actitudes y vida de cada uno de nosotros y tambi n plantea una pol tica de estado sobre la relaci n social y el ambiente en que vivimos
9149776 frente a la amenaza ecol gica que estamos viviendo hoy d a un modelo neoliberal tan extremo y tan desencarnado como el que se est llevando adelante en chile creemos que es altamente perjudicial por la destrucci n de la naturaleza y sus recursos especialmente del agua dejada en manos de empresa particulares que ciertamente lo que buscan es el bien propio y no tanto el bien com n

9149779 es un conflicto que el estado le ha instalado a la comunidad paichil antriao
9149780 el estado ha ido de alg n modo violentando permanentemente el derecho a la consulta y participaci n de la comunidad
9149781 nosotros hemos repudiado tremendamente este acto y vamos a aplicar con rigor la ley pero tambi n con la sensatez de no prejuzgar de no partir haciendo cosas locas por manos individuales sino que respetando la institucionalidad que este pa s tiene

9149787 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
9149788 asombra la facilidad con que se estigmatiza a todo el pueblo mapuche
9149789 me asombra la facilidad con la cual a partir de estos hechos se estigmatiza al pueblo mapuche como un todo cuando quienes vivimos en la regi n de la araucan a y conocemos al campesino de esta etnia sabemos que se trata de personas emprendedoras cuya principal preocupaci n radica en sacar adelante a sus familias y en poder trabajar para conseguirlo tal como cualquier chileno
9149790 conozco al pueblo mapuche he visto como se desconocen sus derechos ancestrales he compartido con l desde mi primera infancia he alojado en sus comunidades y s que son los chilenos a los cuales la sociedad otorga menos oportunidades y de los cuales m s se abusa esto llega al punto de que cuando el estado les asigna recursos como ocurre con el programa or genes hay una corte de intermediarios y consultoras de partidos pol ticos que tienen como conducta permanente aprovechar en propio beneficio los dineros que se destinan al pueblo mapuche
9149791 mientras hay subsidio para plantar rboles en los campos de la araucan a y as desplazar a las ciudades al mapuche no hay subsidio para que estos campesinos puedan siquiera mantener una agricultura de subsistencia ello es inducido por las pol ticas de gobierno para expulsar al mapuche de sus tierras y fr amente desruralizar la araucan a
9149792 la injusta estigmatizaci n que cierta prensa hace del pueblo mapuche el aprovechamiento de ciertos pol ticos de los recursos que la ley destina al pueblo mapuche y la desruralizaci n impulsada desde el estado forman parte del clima contrario a la generaci n de paz social que nuestra araucan a necesita para dejar de ser la m s pobre del pa s y ser la regi n perdedora de la cual hablan los organismos internacionales
9149793 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
9149794 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
9149795 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

9149805 no fue porque exista una conspiraci n del silencio lo que hay es una autorrepresi n psicol gica en la sociedad chilena frente al conflicto con el pueblo mapuche creemos que si no lo vemos desaparece

9149807 sacar el conflicto mapuche del mbito policial y reconocerle su condici n de problema pol tico
9149808 la clave del problema es que nos hemos negado a reconocerles su condici n de pueblo aceptaremos ahora que en el estado de chile puede coexistir m s de un pueblo
9149809 esta es una vieja historia cargada de decepci n y frustraciones
9149810 no hay museo m s chic en chile que el museo de arte precolombino

9149813 nosotros reconocemos en los mapuches a nuestros ancestros pero andar pregonando que uno ha matado al padre es feo
9149814 si ese fondo no hubiera existido acota bengoa hoy el problema ser a inmanejable
9149815 este es un fen meno com n a am rica latina
9149816 el primer gran desaf o que enfrent la conadi fue pronunciarse respecto del proyecto de construcci n de la central hidroel ctrica ralco que requer a aprobar la permuta de terrenos ind genas como los delegados del presidente en dicha organizaci n votaron en contra frei los cambi as la conadi perdi su legitimidad cuando se estrenaba en sociedad
9149817 el informe qued archivado en alg n escritorio en la moneda de donde no volvi a salir
9149818 no les parec a que los delitos calificaran de terrorismo pero el gobierno insisti ante la corte suprema contratando los servicios de un prominente abogado amigo y profesor de los jueces que deb an resolver
9149819 y el tema desapareci de la agenda de gobierno esta administraci n nunca tuvo realmente una pol tica para enfrentar el conflicto mapuche
9149820 estamos dispuestos a aceptar al mapuche folcl rico aquel que baila con sus trajes t picos y es amable pero no al joven que se viste con chaqueta de cuero y que se nos para de igual a igual exigiendo respeto a sus derechos
9149821 pero se equivocaron quienes creyeron que este asistencialismo iba a desindigenizar a los j venes mapuches al contrario el acceso al conocimiento y a los derechos que hoy se les reconocen internacionalmente a los pueblos ind genas han alentado sus demandas
9149822 el gobierno se enfrenta hoy a una intifada mapuche y ya se dio cuenta de que el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas pero es dif cil saber hasta d nde se va a llegar el problema de fondo sigue siendo el reconocimiento pol tico la existencia de un pueblo y el derecho a la tierra porque como ha demostrado el conflicto palestino israel no hay cultura sin territorio
9149823 es un conflicto que el estado le ha instalado a la comunidad paichil antriao
9149824 el estado ha ido de alg n modo violentando permanentemente el derecho a la consulta y participaci n de la comunidad

9149826 el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas
9149827 llamamos al gobierno a promulgar y depositar el convenio 169 de la oit sobre pueblos ind genas el que fuera aprobado por el congreso en marzo pasado y permanece inexplicablemente en el escritorio de la presidenta esperando su firma ello a pesar de que el ejecutivo conoce los procedimientos que este convenio establece para la resoluci n de conflictos por tierras como los que afectan a la comunidad de temucuicui

9149832 en la octava y novena regi n son 1 500 comunidades mapuches
9149833 hay que mirarlo en su justa medida hay que darle la oportunidad a las polic as que trabajen tranquilas porque esta es una investigaci n de largo aliento no son investigaciones de un d a para otro para tener un resultado hay que tener paciencia
9149834 estamos tratando de obtener la mayor informaci n y yo he reforzado la cantidad de funcionarios para ver si podemos detener a las personas que corresponden de acuerdo a las instrucciones de los fiscales
9149835 cuando las demandas no son satisfechas y se van acumulando se pueden generar condiciones para manifestaciones m s duras que en algunos casos llegan a alterar el orden p blico
9149836 si enfrentamos preventivamente las dificultades y las demandas que tienen las comunidades no s lo en temas de tierras sino que en temas de vivienda de agua de asistencia productiva vamos a estar disminuyendo tensiones
9149837 muy pocas han tenido alguna situaci n de conflicto en el pasado
9149838 hechos como el de este domingo el atentado en vilc n claramente est n absolutamente fuera del marco de trabajo en el cual la conadi est funcionando
9149839 en todo momento los carabineros preguntaban por armamento y el paradero de los pe i que est n requeridos por la justicia nuestros luchadores sociales mapuche se nos interroga por armas que jam s han encontrado ni jam s encontrar n porque no existen

9149901 bella arriverei ad odiare me stesso se dovessi farti del male
9149902 prima di te bella la mia vita era una notte senza luna molto buia ma con qualche stella punti di luce e razzionalit poi hai attraversato il cielo come una meteora allimprovviso tutto ha preso fuoco cera luce cera bellezza quando sei sparita scomparsa dietro lorizzonte e il buio tornato non era cambiato nulla ma i miei occhi erano rimasti accecati non vedevo pi stelle niente aveva pi senso
9149903 torner talmente presto che non avrai il tempo di sentire la mia mancanza prenditi cura del mio cuore te lho lasciato
9149904 una cosa mi era chiara e la sentivo in fondo allo stomaco al centro delle ossa dalla punta dei capelli alla pianta dei piedi e nel mio petto vuoto chi ama ha il potere di distruggere e io ero stata distrutta sbriciolata
9149905 il tempo passa anche quando sembra impossibile anche quando il rintocco di ogni secondo fa male come il sangue che pulsa nelle ferite passa in maniera disuguale tra strani scarti e bonacce prolungate ma passa persino per me
9149906 essere amati tanto profondamente ci protegge per sempre anche quando la persona che ci ha amato non c pi

9149961 it was a disgraceful effort today and it all comes down to effort required and it was non existent
9149962 that was one of the things that we spoke about all week the effort and again we spoke about last nights game and the effort required and today it was just non existent
9149963 its a mental application and about your desire to work hard within your role and your team role
9149964 weve blown an opportunity to finish fourth but we have another opportunity in the finals
9149965 some of the guys who have served us so well have been on a slippery dip and some of the guys who have performed poorly today and who performed poorly last week make themselves vulnerable
9149966 do we take them edwards and mcintosh into a finals series probably not being match hardened
9149967 its important to be able to realign yourself refocus and get yourself ready

9149971 another early morning wake up call started day 6 of gumball 3000 for us the plan was to head to shanghai international circuit then finish up in xuzhou for the night it would be the longest drive of the trip at around 10 11 hours total we traveled down the express way which they closed off to the public for us at speeds of 140mph watching our gas gauge constantly dropping we arrived at the shanghai circuit a few hours later and got to do a couple of laps on the formula 1 circuit after our short career as race car drivers we headed to xuzhou to meet up with the rest of the guys we rolled into the city in a pouring rain trying to take it all in we were all exhausted after the long drive so we hit the hay early anticipating our drive to beijing the next morning
9149972 what a beautiful sight it must be amazing to see those stands filled with 200 000 spectators cheering you on
9149973 we were only able to do three laps per car so being that len was the superior car dude we let him do work on the track
9149974 huh i dont even know what to say except it was really hot and i think it got to mike and alys brains
9149975 letting the car cool down after our hot laps on the track this being our first gumball and the evo x mr being such a new platform we decided to keep the mods to the car light as much as we would have loved to strap on a bigger turbo and really test the 4b11t we really didnt want to take the chance of having something go wrong in the middle of china so we stuck to a couple of simple with the greddy ti c exhaust and cusco coilovers the stance on the car looks amazing too with those re30s the evo x not only lived up to expectations it surpassed them we had no problem keeping up with all the big boys on the track and the car never hiccuped along the way we might have to bring it back next year if we do gumball again
9149976 this was at about a hundred miles an hour bam and dunn hitched a ride with the vdub guys for the china leg of the rally

9149980 from our point of view he will be back for the start of next season which is important for us but its sad for him and the new zealand test side
9149981 we just wanted to make some adjustments there we are using these games to work on our combinations of john sutton and craig wing and halfback chris sandow and isaac luke
9149982 i started the game with wingy at hooker which we havent done since hes been at the club and i thought it worked really well
9149983 we brought isaac off the bench a bit fresher it was just a bit of my having a look at the best combination going forward
9149984 we are using these games to learn a lot over the last few weeks we knew we werent going to be in the semi finals
9149985 but were playing the best teams in the competition and were not turning up and just going through the motions because were going out there and really ripping into them

9149994 we send our congratulations to governor sarah palin and her family on her designation as the republican nominee for vice president it is yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward governor palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9149995 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency governor palin shares john mccains commitment to the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9149996 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain
9149997 while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
