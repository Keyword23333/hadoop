5490005 barring some major disruption of the credit markets and a recession were pretty close to the bottom
5490006 until you get this inventory in some of the communities absorbed and in balance youre still going to have a drag on prices
5490007 ive been doing this for 38 years since 1970 and weve never had a market like this where prices are low and interest rates are low
5490008 houses are becoming a little more affordable because prices have dropped 20 25 there has been a pent up demand buyers have been waiting to buy a house
5490009 you can clearly see its not any one particular end of the market that is safe its not any particular end of the market thats growing to me that says the entire market has been affected
5490010 another is the idea that the rail stocks are the one remaining industrial group that hasnt yet capitulated to the bear market and their time is up
5490011 if enough people believe this it could become a self fulfilling prophecy

5490013 last thursday i received an e mail from derek simmons deputy design director of los angeles times derek proposed to me an exciting as well as very honoring job he wanted me to produce a portrait of the incredible michael phelps for the mondays edition of the times lets hope he is going to make it wrote simmons to me the whole last week derek and i exchanged rough sketches photos ideas while michael was beating one record after the other we had so little time as michael was racing almost every day and we had to keep the portrait updated finally he did it in the already known incredible way so this is our tribute to him and his incredible record its published in todays aug 18th 2008 edition of the los angeles times
5490014 credit must go to derek simmons for this great collaboration his suggestions and ideas and to all the photographers of these great michael phelps photos sorry its quite impossible to name them all
5490015 daily in eboli we see drug dealing fights knifings and other violent crime but the mayor has decided to crack down on kissing
5490016 the town is over run with vandals and public buildings are in need of restoration and here we have our mayor imposing fines of up to 500 on courting couples caught kissing
5490017 i really hope that its only the collateral ligament and not the cruciate
5490018 there were some mistakes there are some things which will be looked at again by the lads because we dont usually let in goals like that
5490019 on the whole we played a good game though and i really liked the younger players they showed they possess both talent and personality
5490020 we needed some kind of reaction to cancel out our previous performances and thats what happened
5490021 i am sure that in front of our fans we are going to play a lot better
5490022 we knew that the game was going to be intense because you are already playing for a title
5490023 i think that both teams played well although it is true that at this stage of the season there are still things that are not working well
5490024 what i have been less pleased with is that on occasion we have given too much to valencia there have been times when we have not been focussed have lost the ball very quickly and we have to be more intelligent
5490025 on the other hand we have reacted very well after going 2 1 down i think i have seen several positive things although not everything has gone as we wanted
5490026 we saw a really good football match because gladbach were also set up to attack
5490027 what was important was that we had a very good goalkeeper in goal otherwise there could also have been a goal for borussia in the first half
5490028 after you go 3 0 up the game is normally over but when the other team scores a goal it can become close again
5490029 it was tough because we missed a cutting edge on the counter attack
5490030 we had good chances in the first half to go in front but through individual mistakes we needlessly lost the ball and stuttgart punished that
5490031 we deserved to lose we did not play well hertha were superior in all areas
5490032 in defence they were very good and were dangerous on the counter we did not get into the match at all the win for hertha was fully warranted
5490033 we have been working for little more than a month and we are bit by bit trying to provide calm to the team so they can express themselves with confidence
5490034 they were all comfortable on the pitch they had good motivation and had a great bond with the fans the team have shown their best side
5490035 against madrid we have maintained the line that we showed in the friendly against vitesse
5490036 this is not created either in one day or in six months we are trying to fix a base and be able to carry on in this direction
5490037 what we have seen against real madrid is the identity that we want our team to show
5490038 to maintain this is not easy but it is the path that we want i have been brought here because my previous teams had a personality we had a good night for valencia
5490039 the crowd wasnt particularly spoiled in the first half because this auxerre team posed us quite a few problems
5490040 we needed some superb stops from steve mandanda to save us but it was a lot better in the second half and the last 20 minutes were very good
5490041 and when you see two goals scored by players who started on the bench there is no better sight for a coach
5490042 but auxerre certainly did not deserve to leave having conceded four goals
5490043 we made the most of the chances that we created
5490044 and i noted that there was not one single individual error on the part of my defence in 90 minutes
5490045 when everyone does their job you can be happy and satisfied
5490046 but we cracked physically and psychologically after their second goal we suffered a lot in the second half and om finished well
5490047 marseille impressed me they have a strong team moreover they have players like grandin capable of coming off the bench and making a difference
5490048 he knol has told me that sparta is his first choice
5490049 if it is all sorted out this week i am physically ready to play for psg on saturday against sochaux

5490054 the combination of infrastructure elements such as presence and ip telephony collaborative tools such as shared directories and calendars and contact center technologies is one of the keys for companies looking to provide a stellar customer experience

5490061 randy why does the mayor want a road instead of jobs cudahy tannery leaving we have the opportunity to replace those jobs and that company with another tannery company i have read that it is very hard to get permits and regulations to build a new building for tannery how is this road going to bring jobs to we can do better then a road that is called jobs that actually make something i dont care if walmart happens but here is a place where something could be processed and made what better type of jobs could we have
5490062 randy i am not seeing on the cudahynow site the article i read a couple weeks ago about tearing down the tannery
5490063 your evil spawn angelina jolie and her vacuous hubby brad pitt make about 40 million a year in violent psychopathic movies and give away three of it to starving children trying to look as if they give a crap about humanity as they spit out more dunces that will consume more than their fair share and wreck the earth even more
5490064 miss jolie says she likes john mccain too and hasnt decided who to endorse huh arent you supposed to be somewhat enlightened or do you not know that the african daughter you hold in every picture had parents who suffered and died because of the republican partys worldwide economic assault on africa over the last few decades since reagan

5490068 we look at it as a different dimension the laws of physics are different here star wars is not science fiction at all its much more attuned to mythology to psychology to history than it is to science its more of a parable about the way we are rather than the way were going to be thats why it starts out as a fairytale a long time ago in a galaxy far away once upon a time it deals with princesses its purposely designed not to be about where were going its about where weve been and what we can learn from the past in the present
5490069 we need the help of isps they have the technical ability to manage the flow over their pipes the good news is that were beginning to see some of these solutions emerge in particular in europe and asia
5490070 there is nothing inherently wrong with p2p applications which are legal technologies that are used and welcomed on our network we have consistently said that at amp t will not become an enforcement agent on the internet nor will we inhibit the ability of our customers to access any legal content they want
5490071 can you confirm that at amp t is not monitoring and has no plans to monitor its customers traffic or other online activities to detect possible copyright infringements

5490074 hes going to make a decision and we want him to make that decision with all the information thats out there and not base it on any misconceptions or myths
5490075 he got a higher level of information than any other player has gotten he was really pleasantly surprised
5490076 we thought the meeting went well and marian expressed the same thing
5490077 i have a lot of respect for how they handled that
5490078 i dont control what they do i just represent marian
5490079 he really has no decisions to make the experience playing for the minnesota wild has been great we have no bones to pick about anything i really feel that marian has been treated well and has enjoyed his career there to date

5490081 we played some good stuff but we cant win every week and it is difficult to get in behind this lorient outfit
5490082 i am a bit frustrated to not have won having seen the performance of my players but im satisfied with what we did
5490083 concerning our recruitment of a full back we are looking at the young lens player who would come as an understudy to fabio grosso on the left but lens are being too greedy at the moment
5490084 there is order and discipline the new people that have come in have settled in very well you notice this in training at the moment the feeling is unbeatable
5490085 we are obliged to obtain the maximum getting to the quarter and semi finals is not good enough for barca
5490086 we need to win titles although it is clear that football is about details last year for example we were better than manchester united in the champions league but were knocked out they are very competitive and we have to know how to compete more than them
5490087 not at all at 17 and 18 you cannot imagine you would surpass people who for me were idols migueli amor guardiola zubizarreta at times i cannot believe i have passed these people
5490088 although for me it is more important to continue feeling that you are useful to the team the day that this is not the case i will know it and then i will go
5490089 i have never of thought of saying i am going because i know that this club has ups and downs and i always think that we are going to improve and that we are going to obtain more titles
5490090 but i know that this club is very demanding and that for a player who has spent many years in the team it is difficult to maintain their top level and then i have to be professional and choose what is really best for me at this moment there is nowhere better for me
5490091 we take their coats everyone talks in a big hurry as if we didnt have four long hours ahead of us we self medicate with alcohol a lot of things are discussed different issues everyone laughs a lot but later no one can say what exactly was so witty compliments on the food a couple of monologues then they start to yawn we start to yawn they say we should think about leaving huh and we politely look away like theyve just decided to take a crap on the dinner table everyone stands one of us gets their coats peppy goodbyes we all say what a lovely evening do it again soon blah blah blah and then they leave and we talk about them and they hit the streets and talk about us
5490092 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5490093 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5490094 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5490095 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5490096 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5490097 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5490098 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5490099 i couldnt believe my eyes and ears last night there on the television was a beautiful young girl so young too saying that her labia was unsightly

5490102 and we dont want the city spending money on this that can be spent for other things that the city needs
5490103 i wholly encourage that people speak their opinion the one way we can make the best decision is to know the citizens sentiment on that
5490104 we have to look at our legislators to fund this
5490105 we dont want our property values to take a dive or change
5490106 my paychecks are whats currently paying for our groceries and gas to get to and from work
5490107 schools starting in a couple of weeks and you dont have the money to buy your kids clothes to go back to school in
5490108 they are pulling our soldiers away from good paying jobs where we never had to worry about where our next paycheck was coming from and where we were going to eat and thats what we are going through now
5490109 at one point in time we were told we are not getting our paychecks because texas doesnt have the budget
5490110 ive had enough and i said something has got to be done
5490111 you can give us our paychecks or send our soldiers back home
5490112 man it looks so good were so happy to be back
5490113 i slept in my own bed im all refreshed and feeling good a lot of guys we didnt even talk to each other sunday i got tired of seeing everybody
5490114 we need more playing time to come together as a team
5490115 you have to play some to tackle better and so well play more this week with our starters the same offensively to get timing especially in the passing game
5490116 after looking at the tape we made too many mental mistakes offensively and defensively both
5490117 its a gradual process and we have to embrace the process win when its time to win
5490118 but we have got to come together definitely by the end of the preseason thats our biggest goal and be hitting on all cylinders at the beginning of the regular season
5490119 even in preseason you get back in a routine and back to familiar things now well be more settled
5490120 three weeks from the house i think anybody is tired of being on the road

5490138 the loop is the keystone of parramatta city councils integrated transport plan
5490139 as the economic capital of western sydney parramatta is in need of a quick reliable and low pollution city transport system
5490140 this need is even more urgent when we consider that parramatta will be offering up to 30 000 new jobs over the next 25 years
5490141 this explains why his tax plan gives hundreds of thousands in tax breaks for people earning 2 5 million because theyre only middle class

5490164 while efforts need to be made to stop the bullying of any child we believe its wrong for schools to have mandates pushed on them by homosexual advocacy groups
5490165 these groups have been bragging about a coup in new york and have a clear agenda of promoting their sexual lifestyle to children
5490166 it is not wise to push those types of agendas onto young kids who are still figuring out who they are plus it puts teachers who have deeply held religious convictions in jeopardy

5490179 im committed to making sure that theres equal pay for equal work that is my record and you can count on it
5490180 im going to be honest i know a lot less about economics than i do about military and foreign policy issues i still need to be educated

5490186 opening the door of the political process to people who have never taken part in the past has been the bedrock of our planning for this convention since we arrived in denver one year ago
5490187 twelve months and 56 primaries and caucuses later its only fitting that our delegates represent that same core value and barack obamas unparalleled ability to bring more new people in to the electoral process than ever before young and old first timers and convention veterans all representing a broad spectrum of backgrounds and communities this is a delegation that will bring americas voices to denver
5490188 in just days delegates will come together in denver to conduct the most important business of the convention nominating barack obama as our partys nominee for the next president of the united states
5490189 as we gather in denver to change the course of our nation we will truly represent the strength and diversity of our party and our country

5490195 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5490196 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5490197 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5490198 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5490199 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5490200 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks
5490201 hes going to make a decision and we want him to make that decision with all the information thats out there and not base it on any misconceptions or myths
5490202 he got a higher level of information than any other player has gotten he was really pleasantly surprised

5490222 de citaten van mij zijn volledig uit hun verband gerukt door het financieele dagblad in deze context heb ik het niet gezegd en niet zo bedoeld
5490223 de telegraaf heeft immers wel veel gedaan met nieuwe media en van alles geprobeerd maar had toch twijfel waar nu precies de groei zat voor wat betreft met name de inkomsten
5490224 zoals ook in het fd staat vind ik dat uitgevers zichzelf opnieuw moeten uitvinden
5490225 ik vind dat de telegraaf bij al haar productie veel meer crossmediaal moet gaan opereren
5490226 to steal ideas from one person is plagiarism to steal from many is research

5490234 north carolina is the only state in the entire country that has a targeted presidential race a targeted senate race and a targeted gubernatorial race by the national parties
5490235 senate races nowadays are not just state level races anymore because the control of the u s senate is at stake
5490236 i think its fair to say we have to win north carolina i mean it will be hard to conceive losing states like north carolina
5490237 were keeping our eye on north carolina we will spend what we have to to win the state

5490243 its just been amazing amazing amazing id love to find this lady and give her a big hug
5490244 through our personal story its hard to go to a food bank and ask for the help personally maybe if we can get a brown paper bag filled with essentials and go to a neighborhood and go down the street
5490245 were talking about doing starting a website for rsd and also possibly even do some kind of walk
5490246 not only have we been above average rain fall weve had a lot of frequent rain falls we havent had many opportunities for farmers to bail any dry hay because in order to bail dry hay youre looking for a stretch of three days of no rain three consecutive days of no rain
5490247 the question is that are the field conditions going to allow farmers to get their heavy equipment onto the fields in september without playing in the mud and trying to drag other equipment into the mud to harvest the crops

5490257 the kernel is about pretty harsh technical issues and mistakes are really frowned upon
5490258 autumnal nothing to do with leaves it is to do with a certain brownness at the edges of the day brown is creeping up on us take my word for it russets and tangerine shades of old gold flushing the very outside edge of the senses deep shining ochres burnt umber and parchments of baked earth reflecting on itself and through itself filtering the light at such times perhaps coincidentally the leaves might fall somewhere

5490282 lets form a band you can sing so you be the singer lets do punk cos its easy
5490283 we have many misgivings about the way the hospital handled the case
5490284 in my opinion they were negligent in the speed with which they pronounced my daughters death it is curious how a 600 gram child who is the size of the palm of my hand comes back to life by herself
5490285 when i came to the morgue to collect her her body was wrapped up
5490286 then my wife out of an inexplicable impulse asked to see her again at first i didnt want to break her heart but then i went up when i got there she realized she was moving
5490287 there was one miracle and were hoping for another one
5490288 it was a senior doctor we passed all the findings to the health ministry and they can launch an investigation if they deem appropriate

5490292 life has to be an incessant process of repair and reconstruction of discarding evil and developing goodness in the journey of life if you want to travel without fear you must have the ticket of a good conscience
5490293 when we originally came up with the concept of doing the game the whole idea of continuing content was pretty amorphous how that was going to happen who pays for that we all kind of assumed that would come out of the revenue the subscription money we did get we all poured directly into keeping the game online keeping it up and running but the development demands far outstripped the revenues there just wasnt a good contemplation early on of how that would work
5490294 some of them were just bad timing in the pc market the pc market was lousy last year some of it was the fact that we were an independent studio we didnt have unlimited money and we had to ship when we had to ship part of it was because we overreached and that was a design problem that was totally our fault we tried to do too much we tried to be a standalone game and a free play game and an mmo and an rpg and a shooter we were trying to be something for everybody and ended up really not pleasing many people at all
5490295 i think thats a thing that the general world never sees
5490296 these guys make games they have this business they did it it didnt work out they move on

5490304 i can attest from personal experience that many of these bike lanes bring riders within far less than 3 feet if not mere inches from the cars parked to the right of cyclists adjacent to the curb
5490305 if our municipalities are going to continue putting these bike lanes this close to parked vehicles it would seem to me that a change in this obscure state law is in order

5490354 by paul craig roberts online journal contributing writer aug 18 2008 00 14 the success of the bush regime s propaganda lies and deception with gullible and inattentive americans since 9 11 has made it difficult for intelligent aware people to be optimistic about the future of the united states for almost eight years the us media have served as ministry of propaganda for a war criminal regime americans incapable of thinking for themselves reading between the lines or accessing foreign media on the internet have been brainwashed as the nazi propagandist joseph goebbels said it is easy to deceive a people you just tell them they have been attacked and wave the flag it certainly worked with americans

5490369 how dreadful are the curses which mohammedanism lays on its votaries besides the fanatical frenzy which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog there is this fearful fatalistic apathy the effects are apparent in many countries improvident habits slovenly systems of agriculture sluggish methods of commerce and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the prophet rule or live a degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement the next of its dignity and sanctity the fact that in mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property either as a child a wife or a concubine must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of islam has ceased to be a great power among men individual moslems may show splendid qualities but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it no stronger retrograde force exists in the world far from being moribund mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith it has already spread throughout central africa raising fearless warriors at every step and were it not that christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science the science against which it had vainly struggled the civilization of modern europe might fall as fell the civilization of ancient rome

5490378 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5490379 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5490380 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5490381 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5490383 lafaz sumpah itu betul mengikut ajaran islam tetapi tindakan memegang al quran dan berada dalam masjid tidak perlu dilakukan
5490384 sekiranya dia benar dia akan selamat tetapi jika dia berbohong lambat laun kelaknatan allah akan turun kepadanya dalam berbagai perkara yang tidak tergambar oleh dirinya sendiri
5490385 keberanian saiful melafazkan lafaz yang seperti itu menunjukkan samada dia meyakini apa yang dia dakwa ataupun dia tidak faham akan kesan terhadap lafaz berkenaan pada masa hadapan
5490386 bukan mudah seseorang melafazkan sumpah mubahalah itu melainkan dia dalam keadaan tidak siuman ataupun dia sedar apa yang diyakini itu benar
5490387 oleh kerana akan timbul kesangsian pihak yang di cabar dan untuk menghilangkan keraguan masyarakat maka pihak yang didakwa iaitu datuk seri anwar ibrahim hendaklah melafazkan sumpah bermubahalah dengan bentuk yang sama maka jadilah mubahalah yang mana kita akan lihat hukuman tuhan nanti

5490393 they said we dont want to have hustler represented anywhere on this trade show floor
5490394 i was told that if the booth was not struck immediately we would be thrown in jail
5490395 it sucks because we lost money but we made the right decision
5490396 the thing is people love seeing the hustler tent and buying the goods we have to offer they get really excited when they see we are there and we are having a blast guerrilla marketing our brands on the tour

5490464 parents who neglect their children arent evil or malicious people
5490465 they might be mentally ill or have drug addictions or they might be young and with no support but they are losing their children when they could be given a second chance
5490466 controversial position but its something that needs to be said
5490467 with the best of intentions and everybody involved has the very best intentions they have started to be punitive to parents who are doing the best they know how
5490468 often theres not even a strong likelihood that a child is at risk but the child will be reported to the department of community services

5490604 it is a pity that the seats in the kimberley and pilbara are no longer needed for parties to form government

5490639 christs faithful have the right indeed at times the duty in keeping with their knowledge competence and position to manifest to the sacred pastors their views on matters which concern the good of the church they have the right also to make their views known to others of christs faithful but in doing so they must always respect the integrity of faith and morals show due reverence to the pastors and take into account both the common good and the dignity of individuals
5490640 the catholic church is the only thing which saves a man from the degrading slavery of being a child of his age
5490641 good work usually arises when the creators seem to have no ambitions towards gilt culture but are involved in a kind of squandering beaverish endeavor that isn t anywhere or anything it goes always forward eating its own boundaries and likely as not leaves nothing in its path other than the signs of eager industrious unkempt activity

5490653 i grant that youve seen a lot of evidence that i havent but heres my question for you if i saw and read everything that youve seen and read what would i conclude
5490654 we think its good for the employees and good for the company

5490663 what are some of the warning signs of postpartum depression ppd
5490664 the good news is its consistent the higher your vitamin d status the lower the risk of your developing a hip fracture
5490665 we conclude that low serum vitamin d concentrations are associated with an increased risk for hip fracture in community dwelling women the mechanism of association is unclear
5490666 if you dont have inadequate vitamin d you cannot efficiently absorb calcium
5490667 vitamin d also helps maintain bone health by keeping bone cells active
5490668 to get vitamin d levels to where they need to be to reduce the risk of hip fracture you need to be taking at least 1 000 international units of vitamin d a day from a supplement
5490669 they need to ask their doctor for the right test
5490670 women should strive to keep your vitamin d levels above 125 nanomoles per liter year round to do that they are going to require supplements
5490671 its getting harder and harder to believe that these cells are immunoprivileged

5490708 during my time in georgia i surveyed the human and geopolitical consequences of the conflict there firsthand
5490709 i left the country convinced that russias invasion of georgia may be the one of the most significant event to occur in europe since the end of communism
5490710 russia must make good on president medvedevs commitment to immediately withdraw russian troops to their positions before the current fighting began
5490711 when congress reconvenes i intend to work with the administration to seek congressional approval for 1 billion in emergency assistance for georgia with a substantial down payment on that aid to be included in the congress next supplemental spending bill
5490712 i have long sought to help russia realize its extraordinary potential as a force for progress in the international community and have supported legislative efforts intended to forge a more constructive relationship with the kremlin but russias actions in georgia will have consequences

5490724 i do not believe the state should force pharmacies to stock or sell plan b or any other drug
5490725 just as government shouldnt tell grocery store owners that they have to sell certain types of groceries or hardware store owners that they have to sell certain types of tools it shouldnt tell pharmacists which drugs to sell
5490726 as governor i will be committed to improving our public schools

5491117 given the high food prices around the world and the need for poor people to lower their cost of food it just does not make sense for the doha negotiations to founder upon this barrier
5491118 working with wto director general pascal lamy the united states india and china should come up with a compromise
5491119 brazil a developing country that is both a major agricultural exporter and home to many poor farmers can help indonesia and australia may be in a position to contribute to a solution too
5491120 a compromise could create a speedy due process for challenges without appeal
5491121 could require examination of factors in addition to increased trade flows
5491122 under current wto practice the economy imposing a safeguard decides how much protection is appropriate but this protection could be disciplined and limited
5491123 president lula of brazil has called on the parties not to let the wto negotiations fail because of differences over a special safeguard for agriculture he is right
5491124 there is too much at stake to let this problem derail a global trade package that could expand economic growth and opportunity by cutting cut subsidies drastically lowering tariffs significantly and opening up services markets
5491125 i felt a little stupid and embarrassed that i hadnt watched the show prior to having a meeting with them
5491126 but im happy to say that the episodes that they sent me to look at were really really engaging and really wonderful and kind of dark and moody like a lot of the work that ive actually been involved in
5491127 our learning is natural organic it doesnt happen while our life is put on hold it happens as life happens its real life and real learning
5491128 i dont see the plans im making as overly complicated they make sense to me they dont overwhelm me the thought of putting them into action does give me angst it inspires me
5491129 i have learned that as my family has grown im not that good at thinking on the fly i cant process information fast enough a rough sketch of a day doesnt work it leaves me too much to decide in the moment and that leaves me lots of opportunities to get flustered impatient and irritable on the other hand there is plenty of room in a well laid plan for accomodations
5491130 nearly 3 000 new members were written during the month making a total of 15 000 since the first of the year the total membership of the society today is near 90 000
5491131 there hasnt been a goodwill tour sponsored by the chamber of commerce since the early 1920s where the bright scotch plaids tooting horn pipes and rattling drums havent been the feature attraction
5491132 we came from a situation where we produced 5 000 kg of corn by hectare while today it is 10 to 12 000 kg per hectare of corn
5491133 we have more chinese people eating we have more indians eating we have more africans eating and we have a lot more brazilians eating
5491134 all this which is treated by the press as if it were a crisis and is sold to the world as if it were a crisis
5491135 without any arrogance or self importance we brazilians need to confront what for others is a crisis as an extraordinary opportunity to truly transform ourselves into the granary of the world as many people have long predicted
5491136 without any doubt there is potential to produce if the government doesnt get in the way
5491137 we are not even going to say help if they dont get in the way a lot year by year the producer is generally increasing production
5491138 if you talk about central brazil there are still a lot of areas to be exploited so i dont have much doubt
5491139 what we have seen in the last 10 years is a quiet revolution happening in our country mostly in agribusiness production
5491140 we came from being an irrelevant international market participant to be one of the worlds major food and biofuel suppliers today
5491141 so if you look at what happened to our agriculture in terms of beef exports poultry exports again we were irrelevant and now we have the position of largest exporter in the world in major food crops
5491142 the impact will start to emerge with more intensity within 20 to 30 years and until then we should be preparing for this
5491143 the perspective for the moment for future harvests is highly productive so brazil has the potential to continue growing around 5 to 6 a year in terms of increasing harvests we are going to effectively maintain this rhythm in the coming years without any problem
5491144 we are not against expanding the brazilian capacity for producing food and helping brazil to develop this country
5491145 you can increase the food capacity through technology through better practices through occupying areas that are already degraded to investing in better crops
5491146 but you can not increase your productivity at the expense of the environment because the global market doesnt accept this price any more
5491147 if we have the right investments coming on for logistics for infrastructure and for technology and land development the country can multiply by two and a half three times the actual production in the next 10 years
5491148 of course we have increases that could come from europe from the usa from canada from argentina
5491149 but where you see the best conditions in order to give the world society the best rate of return in terms of investment is in brazil
5491150 if you talk about the next five years we are now producing 130 million tonnes of grains we can easily go to 250 million tonnes
5491151 we are now producing seven million hectares of sugar cane this can go to 20 million hectares helping to supply ethanol to the world we are only exporting 400m of fruits we can go to 3bn of fruits
5491152 next up is africa i think for africa this could be a redemption in terms of inclusion of people in production systems and making africa produce food and biofuels for the world
5491153 world demand for food today is one billion tonnes and brazil produces 150 million tonnes
5491154 brazil produces 150 million tonnes and the plan launched by the government for more food will produce six million more which is going to leave one million for export how is brazil going to be the granary of food production
5491155 a designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add but when there is nothing left to take away

5491159 i like my job i like my work i like it here in iowa
5491160 they dont go after employers they dont put ceos in jail
5491161 is like a natural disaster only this one is manmade
5491162 in the end it is the greater population that will suffer and the workforce that will be held accountable
5491163 until we enforce our immigration laws equally against both employers and employees who break the law we will continue to have a problem
5491164 can we really execute a search warrant without taking any action against illegal employment that we know is taking place
5491165 or will just taking business records through a search warrant cause illegal aliens to leave and then were not fulfilling that part of the mission as well
5491166 i know its only a tropical storm but we take it seriously
5491167 this isnt the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs
5491168 while they are deploying the missile shield in poland and the czech republic our strategic bombers will already be landing in cuba
5491169 putin and medvedev are very militant in words but very cautious in practical issues they have not taken any step that can be seen as a real threat to the west and i cannot see any reason to raise this threat against the u s
5491170 if its true it looks like a repetition of the caribbean crisis
5491171 we will be forced to react not with diplomatic but with military technical methods
5491172 work opportunities here are nonexistent so this is going to cause more migration to the united states even though it is getting harder to find work over there
5491173 this is demonstrating that there is an increased dependence on remittances and a great vulnerability for the country
5491174 neither the government nor the families who are affected have a good alternative to remittances
5491175 senator mccains proposal is bold its aggressive its an all of the above approach
5491176 senator obama has taken a very minimalist or none of the above or very few of the above approaches
5491177 i personally believe that if barack obama gets elected he will slam the door shut on these options
5491178 if senator mccain is elected he will open the door to these options and allow our energy supply to be increased and take some of the pressure off our energy crisis in the country
5491179 midwesterners like authenticity and not someone who is phony or too glitzy senator mccain is authentic and if you look at how his issues line up with mainstream voters they line up more closely than barack obamas do all of those things are going to serve him well in the midwest
5491180 it would be a betrayal to my conscience to accept a responsibility requiring more mobility and dedication than i am physically able to offer
5491181 he has prepared things he has prepared for this he is an intelligent man
5491182 they wanted to knock him down knock him down but he left on his own
5491183 i think what were going to see now is a handoff period
5491184 were going to see the historicos the revolutions first generation handing off to the second generation there will probably be a collective quality to leadership

5491191 i dont like all this dirty campaigning why bother to vote
5491192 it was only a matter of time mexico is a very centralized country and we shouldnt be surprised that narco traffickers have operating branches in the capital
5491193 this has given us a message that yes theyre here and theyre armed to their teeth
5491194 worked responsibly and he was involved in a series of judicial processes connected to organized crime
5491195 we know the fundamental reason for his assassination is related to this
5491196 from the beginning ive said we have to see how penetrated we are
5491197 the situation is a penetration of some sectors of the military forces and its a small percentage of the forces we cannot say its generalized
5491198 its just going to give more fuel to the legislative opposition here in washington
5491199 the real enemy is that its going to get amended to death

5491205 the police never treat you as a citizen as part of the neighborhood they treat you as a hindrance
5491206 they look at you and treat you like a dog
5491207 the guatemalan people would have preferred a more clear and positive response no more deportations
5491208 we have never been so close to finding a solution to this problem as now
5491209 you know full well that if we dont have enough consensus nothing is going to move out of the senate
5491210 and if nothing moves out of the senate nothing is going to happen in the house
5491211 the biggest problem in this debate is going to be what to do with the people who are already in our country illegally
5491212 and i explained to him there will not be amnesty automatic citizenship its just not going to happen nor is it feasible to try to kick everybody out of our country thats not possible
5491213 the question is what will be the approach of the u s government
5491214 my attitude is that we need to use the opportunity to call the world together to promote democracy as the alternative to the form of government they have been living with
5491215 freedom of speech freedom of association and freedom of conscience are not a thorn in the side of government
5491216 disagreeing with your government is not unpatriotic and most certainly should not be a crime in any country especially a democracy
5491217 im not guilty of anything to do with abu ghraib and im tired of it
5491218 im saddened by the whole event and i feel like ive been singled out for it
5491219 sacrificing him on the altar of public opinion while slowly letting everyone else fade out of view
5491220 hes now a prisoner of his own service hes been in prison now for four years emotionally physically and almost literally because he hasnt been able to return to civilian life

5491223 the united states pakistan relationship is going to become stronger as a result of musharraf leaving the scene
5491224 every time he took away peoples civil liberties every time somebody went to prison every time somebody went missing and joined the ranks of the disappeared every action of musharraf angered people against the united states that factor is now gone
5491225 at different levels of being discredited the united states was holding onto a very narrow base which was not good for pakistan and not good for the united states
5491226 its a big country its a complex place there are 165 million people we cant just do it all through authoritarian rulers or through the military we have to push the democratic opening thats taking place there

5491230 the perception of endemic corruption scares off foreign investors and has a knock on effect on economic growth
5491231 corruption in iraq is very bad because theres been conflict across the country
5491232 that tends to mean the systems that uphold the country arent working
5491233 these facilitators have the skills the knowledge the credibility and the connections to smooth the path of corruption
5491234 everyone is asking themselves should i vote for the candidate i really want or should i vote for the guy who i think can beat ortega

5491236 they say we have to wait and wait we have been waiting all this time
5491237 we soldiers were tricked they told us the threat was communism
5491238 but i look back and realize those werent communists out there that we were fighting we were just poor country people killing poor country people
5491239 we gave our blood we killed our friends and in the end things are still bad
5491240 look at all this poverty and look how the wealth is concentrated in just a few hands
5491241 those are people who get money sent from their relatives working in the united states
5491242 theyre the only people around here who can afford a nice house
5491243 they accept in principal that they will withdraw their candidacies but they are not set on a third country
5491244 we encouraged them to reach a solution quickly and we expressed our willingness to go for a consensus

5491277 they had details of explosives and poisons along with information about london landmarks and a computer folder on royal residences we would be foolish to rule out the fact that they may have been planning an attack
5491278 let there be no doubt these are dangerous individuals these men were not simply in possession of material which expressed extremist views they were also in possession of material that was operationally useful to anyone wishing to carry out an act of violence or terrorism

5491282 we may look at a different combination of openers for the next game but its at a very initial stage we have just gone through the first game so whatever fits the team best well decide on that
5491283 it took us a bit long to figure out the two guys out
5491284 no not too tough to pick but he had good control it became easier as it went on and you figured out the shots you could use to score

5491301 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5491302 that room was totally free with no monitors a flat out lie
5491303 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because that what theyre putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5491304 a motorist survey this year by the rubber manufacturers association found that 85 percent of american drivers do not properly check tire inflation pressure this is an alarming statistic since tires are the only part of a vehicle in contact with the road and a critical vehicle safety component
5491305 drivers across the u s can battle rising gas prices by simply maintaining proper tire inflation
5491306 current statistics indicate that 82 million vehicles have under inflated tires which means more rubber is hitting the road and accordingly miles per gallon is lessened in fact tire experts speculate that 2 8 billion gallons of gas is wasted by u s drivers each year simply because theyre driving on under inflated tires
5491307 the chps traffic safety commitment extends to safety campaigns like these which aim to reduce needless fatalities and injuries on california highways
5491308 our research shows that this improper inflation issue has been prevalent for years
5491309 that andreas excuse for leveling accusation against mac you buy into that prfsr
5491310 we as a campaign have not said anything about it though the mccain folks do seem pretty sensitive on the point
5491311 he made time to go to the gym but canceled a visit with wounded troops
5491312 obama had no intention of bringing any cameras with him i was there i can vouch for that
5491313 i could not vote for an atheist because an atheist says i dont need god
5491314 theyre saying im totally self sufficient by myself and nobody is self sufficient to be president by themselves its too big a job
5491315 i could not vote for an atheist because an atheist says i dont need god
5491316 theyre saying im totally self sufficient by myself and nobody is self sufficient to be president by themselves its too big a job
5491317 there has been a lot of piling on but today the people of judge rule on the facts of the case
5491318 it was clear that there would be some challenge to the council so the backstop is in fact the governor
5491319 the nations largest african american electoral base has reached a state of paralysis
5491320 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
5491321 very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
5491322 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5491323 the city is a cold place now people are fearful
5491324 i am sure that such a well conducted effective peacemaking operation aimed at protecting our citizens and other people will be among the most glorious deeds of the russian military
5491325 the world realized that even now there are political freaks who were ready to kill innocent people for the sake of political fashions and who compensated for their own stupidity by eliminating a whole nation
5491326 i think the russians will pull out but will damage georgia strongly
5491327 georgia will survive but russia has lost its credibility in the eyes of the world
5491328 now this whole musharraf excuse is behind us now people are going to be focusing on their performance
5491329 we believe that respect for the democratic and constitutional processes in that country is fundamental to pakistans future and its fight against terrorism
5491330 i am going with the satisfaction that whatever i have done was for the people and for the country i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5491331 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more
5491332 he even tried to deceive the nation in his last address he was boasting about economic progress when life for people like us has become a hell
5491333 the government had been blaming musharraf for inflation power cuts and the weak economy and since now he has resigned we hope that the government will take steps to make our life better
5491334 his resignation clears the way for our government to get on with providing to the people of pakistan basic social services economic opportunities political security and law and order
5491335 its a huge challenge and they cannot face it individually its very important for them to work together and i think they know that
5491336 america wants some immediate decisions on fighting terrorism and i dont think they will be able to concentrate on that
5491337 on the other hand are the people of this country the business community and there too i dont see any new initiatives
5491338 the crimes of musharraf against the nation against the judiciary against democracy and against rule of law in the country cannot be forgiven by any party or individual
5491339 whatever one might say it may be difficult for the politicians to give him the indemnity
5491340 there were certain elements who were politicking with the economy and terrorism
5491341 hello my name is inigo montoya you killed my father prepare to die
5491342 if she had nothing shed find something to give you
5491343 snap out of it show a little backbone and get on with life
5491344 well placed cameras can save lives and reduce accidents there is no doubt about that
5491345 what worries me is that many people believe there are some cameras across britain that are only there to make money
5491346 i have already sanctioned the removal of two camera housings which were no longer needed on the chester road
5491347 why would he ever come here just to get a bunch of crowds to boo him he would be nuts to come up here
5491348 it would make the protests in europe look small i dont see any good purpose other than to check the box to say he was in all 50 states
5491349 obviously president bushs approval ratings in vermont are very low
5491350 i expect that president bush will visit here sometime before his term ends he is certainly welcome
5491351 i think he understands he is not wildly popular in vermont
5491352 with or without a picture of him with george bush its clear that gov douglas sees george bush as someone that he looks up to as his leader
5491353 i dont think it helps jim douglas at all politically to have a picture standing next to the president
5491354 he will be met with massive protests no matter where he appears in vermont he will face a massive protest
5491355 we think its good for the employees and good for the company
5491356 but we achieved the best settlement possible in light of qwests struggle to regain its financial health
5491357 the politicization of energy is only beneficial to those running for office
5491358 if our national leadership cannot come to grips with a problem of this severity theres something wrong with the process and the people
5491359 every time the price drops americans just say ok the problem is solved
5491360 just having prices ease up a little bit at the pump did not solve the problem
5491361 well be right back to the pump price that made you uncomfortable originally
5491362 its unrealistic to suggest that alternatives are right around the corner when the infrastructure is not there
5491363 thats different than a two to four year election cycle

5491366 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
5491367 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
5491368 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
5491369 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
5491370 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

5491381 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price

5491417 at what point is a baby entitled to human rights
5491418 answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
5491419 when you come down to the life question it is so core to what we believe and what we believe gods heart is about
5491420 when a person fumbles on that question it really gives us a clue as to what their worldview is about
5491421 hes contending for the most powerful seat in the world president of the united states and for him to equivocate on that issue theres really not a lot of room for that
5491422 constitutionally a fetus has no rights of personhood most legal precedent in english law attributes personhood to the live born

5491425 i believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman now for me as a christian its also a sacred union gods in the mix

5491475 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5491476 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5491477 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5491484 im happy to state that despite all the criticism and the cynicism we have not changed our style and i would now like to believe that the very fact that it was criticised has now become the tours usp which is of course excellent news to us
5491485 i would also say that we havent changed our style and that perhaps the western audiences taste has changed
5491486 if i can speak for everyone its really been wonderful because we never expected so many people to know us we never expected so many people to show up we really didnt expect this great a response and its truly been overwhelming
5491487 ive always referred to the tour as it kind of takes you back to college and summer camp where we got the opportunity to spend time together which we dont normally get when were working on film

5491524 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5491525 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5491526 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5491527 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5491528 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5491529 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5491530 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5491531 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5491532 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5491533 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5491534 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

5491554 mi madre era una simple costurera que trabajaba hasta las madrugadas para ayudar a mi padre mi padre era una guardia nocturno por eso se pueden imaginar el sacrificio que hicieron para tener un hijo m dico luego escog la ginecolog a y la obstetricia
5491555 entre las mayores dificultades enfrentadas como m dico reci n formado choqu con la realidad de lo que es mi profesi n en un largo tiempo los m dicos se vuelven ricos y yo quer a m s quer a enriquecerme y tener m s dinero fue as como viol el juramento que hice cuando me formaba para dar la vida para salvar la vida ayud a muchos ni os a venir al mundo pero tambi n a muchos de ellos no les permit nacer y me enriquec escondido tras la m scara de la vitalidad
5491556 puse un consultorio que en poco tiempo se convirti en el m s visitado de la regi n y saben qu es lo que hac a abortos y como todos los que cometen el crimen me dec a a mi mismo que todas las mujeres tienen el derecho de escoger y que era mejor que sean ayudadas por un m dico para no correr los riesgos de ir a una cl nica clandestina donde los ndices de muertes son alarmantes
5491557 y fue as en un ciego e inhumano oficio de medicina que constru una familia con muchos bienes muy rica y que nada le faltaba mis padres murieron con la ilusi n de que su hijo era un doctor bien logrado exitoso cri a mis hijas con el dinero manchado con la sangre de inocentes y fui el m s despreciable de los humanos mis manos que debieron ser bendecidas para la vida trabajaron para la muerte
5491558 s lo par cuando dios en su sabidur a infinita rasg mi conciencia e hizo sangrar a mi coraz n con la misma sangre de todos los inocentes que no dej nacer mi hija menor leticia dej de respirar por una infecci n generalizada luego de haberse sometido a un aborto ella de 23 a os de edad sali embarazada y busc el mismo camino de tantas otras que me fueron a buscar el camino del aborto y s lo supe de esto cuando ya nada se pod a hacer
5491559 al lado del lecho de muerte de mi hija vi las l grimas de todos esos angelitos que yo mat mientras ella esperaba la muerte yo agonizaba junto a ella fueron seis d as de sufrimiento para que en el s timo d a ella partiese hacia el encuentro con su hijo al cual un m dico asesino le impidi nacer
5491560 cansado por las noches que pas al lado de mi hija yo so que andaba por un lugar absolutamente oscuro y muy h medo en el que quer a respirar pero no pod a yo quer a salir desesperadamente pero fui envuelto por un lugar en donde el estruendo me dejaba at nito eran los llantos dolidos de los ni os que en mi pensamiento como si un rayo me cortase por la mitad ve a en mi entendimiento los llantos eran de dolor eran los lamentos de los angelitos que yo no dej nacer era la triste consecuencia de mis actos sin pensar esos llantos que gritaban asesino asesino
5491561 asustado para salir de aquel lugar pas mi mano por mi rostro para secar mi sudor y mis manos se mancharon de sangre aterrorizado grit con toda la fuerza que me quedaba un pedido de perd n dios me perdone s lo as logr respirar nuevamente y me acord de que era tiempo de acoger y valorar el ltimo respiro de mi hija que muri por las consecuencias de la infecci n que le produzco el aborto yo s eso a trav s de mi sue o
5491562 dios me hizo entender que a partir del momento de la fecundaci n del vulo existe vida por lo que entend que soy un asesino no s si alg n d a dios me va a perdonar pero para restar mi culpa y mi dolor vend mi consultorio y todos los bienes que consegu con la pr ctica del aborto y con ese dinero constru una casa de amparo para madres solteras y me dedico hoy a atender y practicar una medicina de verdad
5491563 hoy soy m dico de los pobres de los desamparados y desvalidos y los ni os que vienen al mundo a trav s de mis manos son hijos que adopto pues s que tengo una sola misi n traer la vida al mundo y dar condiciones para que los ni os tengan un lugar feliz donde el padre es jes s recen por m recen para que dios tenga piedad de m y me perdone porque tengo la seguridad de que participar del juicio final

5491580 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
5491581 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
5491582 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
5491583 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
5491584 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
5491585 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
5491586 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana

5491601 sometimes parents think helping their child complete their homework or even doing their childs homework for him will help him achieve better grades in school
5491602 often its just the opposite creating a situation where children have not learned the concepts they are later tested on in the classroom
5491603 help your child understand that the work of childhood is getting an education
5491604 that way when school begins theyre ready to hit the ground running

5491617 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5491618 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5491619 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5491620 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5491621 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5491622 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5491623 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

5491648 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5491649 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5491650 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5491651 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5491652 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5491653 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5491654 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5491655 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
5491656 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
5491657 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
5491658 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
5491659 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5491660 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5491661 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5491662 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5491663 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5491664 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5491665 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5491666 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5491667 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5491668 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
5491669 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso

5491672 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5491673 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5491674 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5491675 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5491676 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5491677 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5491678 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5491679 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5491680 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5491681 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5491682 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5491683 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5491684 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5491685 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5491686 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5491687 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5491688 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5491689 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a

5491707 history is unlikely to be kind to prime minister ehud olmert of israel he disastrously mismanaged the 2006 lebanon war and now besmirched by financial scandals he has announced plans to leave office as soon as a successor can be confirmed mr olmert does however understand that a two state solution with the palestinians is vital for israels security we hope that his successor does as well and brings a greater sense of urgency to the negotiations there has always been a wide gap between what mr olmert understands about the need for a peace settlement and what he has done about it merely meeting the palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas for periodic talks is not enough without jeopardizing its security israel could take important steps to improve the lives of ordinary palestinians and give them a real stake in peace in his remaining weeks or months in power mr olmert could burnish his legacy and the prospects for an agreement if he announced a full freeze on expansion of jewish settlements and reduced the number of roadblocks in the west bank that are strangling the palestinian economy
5491708 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5491709 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5491710 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5491711 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5491712 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5491713 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5491714 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built

5491716 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5491717 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5491718 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5491719 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5491720 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5491721 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5491722 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5491723 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5491724 1920 1080 148 5 1920 2008 2052 2200 1080 1084 1089 1125
5491725 weak players make this move instinctively in dire dread of having a piece pinned
5491726 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5491727 1920 1080 148 5 1920 2008 2052 2200 1080 1084 1089 1125
5491728 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5491729 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5491730 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5491731 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5491732 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5491733 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5491734 1920 1080 148 5 1920 2008 2052 2200 1080 1084 1089 1125
5491735 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5491736 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5491737 1920 1080 148 5 1920 2008 2052 2200 1080 1084 1089 1125
5491738 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5491739 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5491740 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5491741 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5491742 it youre a bit of a technology geek like myself etchstar com is one
5491743 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5491744 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5491745 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5491746 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5491747 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

5491772 while this is lower than comparable deals done since the beginning of 2007 we did not expect unionbancal to command similar multiples in a take out
5491773 we expect the revised terms will be met favorably by shareholders and now assume the acquisition will be completed at the current offer price within a relatively short time frame
5491774 we consider the price reasonable given the current uncertain state of the banking industry

5491850 the gap in revenue per employee between google and sap and salesforce com for instance indicates that google would more likely be more interested in what ebay does or in monetizing youtube than in zoho or salesforce coms barely profitable business companies invest in what generates the best return on investment
5491851 googles margins are a once in a lifetime occurrence and google will move in that high growth direction thats why microsoft is so desperate about search it has a higher growth rate we are more worried about microsoft than google microsoft will address the internet but pulling down office margins is a challenge for them no company peacefully accepts a lowering of margins
5491852 our intention is to help erode microsofts profit margin coming in from below
5491853 if salesforce is a proxy it would be difficult for google to justify the investment more costs are associated with support than in r amp d even with on demand software the moment you have paying customers the expectations are different and google is finding that out with recent gmail problems
5491854 one of the privileges we enjoy as a private company is to not disclose revenue profit numbers which lets us do the kind of analysis on competitors they cant do on us

5491862 i want everyone off the internet bloggers are filth they need to be destroyed blogging gives the illusion of participation to a bunch of retards we need to put these people in the oven
5491863 the question we have to answer is how do we kill four of the worlds six billion people in the most just way possible
5491864 i cant push you into the fire but i can look at you while youre burning in the fire and not be required to help

5491868 the cow she thinks shes a dog so shes interested in everything
5491869 you could hear her going on and on because she was standing right behind the stage curtain
5491870 shes talking and talking meanwhile you have the entire audience waiting almost two hours for the taping to start
5491871 she leaves us waiting and everyone is sitting there complaining and then she comes out and doesnt say a word about it she didnt even say hello she got right into her script
5491872 tyra kept saying when i was a model and would hardly let them talk
5491873 she had the audience prance down the street and then release black balloons some were whining that it was so bad for the environment
5491874 we argue that humans possess an innate system for enumeration that doesnt rely on words
5491875 basic number and arithmetic skills are built on a specialized innate system
5491876 our findings are consistent with the idea that we have an innate system for representing quantity ideas and that the lack of number words in a language should not prevent us from completing simple number and computation tasks
5491877 perhaps the most striking result comes from the cross modal matching task where the child has to put out the number of counters corresponding to a sequence of auditory events
5491878 this cannot be done using visual memory but requires the child to generate a mental representation that is abstract enough to serve to represent both auditory and visual enumeration
5491879 in order to demonstrate their desired conclusion the authors would need to evaluate an age group across languages with and without number words where the participants in the language with number words can succeed in getting close to 100 percent accuracy on the tasks then the effects of the absence of number words can be evaluated in the population speaking the language that lacks number words
5491880 in our recent work we have demonstrated that piraha speakers achieve high accuracy on matching tasks despite having no count words whatsoever not even a word for one
5491881 those groups without whose support the organization would cease to exist
5491882 obvious literary device meant to call into question the emphasis on stockholders

5491888 the artist is thus to be like the israelite spies in the desert bringing back fruit from the promised land to be tasted in advance here is the challenge i believe for the christian artist in whatever sphere to tell the story of the new world so that people can taste it and want it even while acknowledging the reality of the desert in which we presently live
5491889 it is horrible that somebody wanted to sell these photos and even thought there was offered disgusting business blesk finally bought pictures the only reason why magazine bought them was to prohibit seller in further propagation blesk made a decision to do not use those photos only on the front page
5491890 the key for the paparazzo is to get the information and get the shot before other paparazzi do
5491891 supermodel heidi klum took a similar approach to keep paparazzi away from her daughter
5491892 thats why i released the photos of her instead of having photographers hunt for them

5491896 obamas shifting stance on space exploration is indicative of his inexperience on issues important to voters
5491897 lets be honest obama is only embracing nasa now because of his political problems in florida
5491898 something that is elemental and a vital part of our space program
5491899 i think weve got to sort out our priorities better in other words we cant do everything

5491910 you know i can cut the grass paint the house clean the pool
5491911 is it ethical for health care professionals to support the administration of drugs that are of unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed
5491912 in this way supervised injection sites undercut the ethics of medical practice and set a debilitating example for all physicians and nurses both present and future in canada who might begin to question whether its ok to let someone overdose in their care
5491913 imagine for a moment a doctor that has a patient with a serious but treatable case of cancer
5491914 there is a better alternative for injection drug users and that is treatment even if they fail treatment the first time we can help them to get up and try again
5491915 its also the ninth case in an animal born after canadas 1997 feed ban and the eighth case born after march 1 1999 a date usda u s department of agriculture uses to try to convince us that any canadian cattle born after that date are safe to import into the united states
5491916 this particular animal would have been eligible for export to the u s and that should concern everyone
5491917 for quite some time now canada has not been testing herd mates of infected cattle to see if there might be other cases of bse in a particular herd and the u
5491918 cfias mantra that every new bse case in canada was identified by the national bse surveillance program which has been highly successful in demonstrating the low level of bse in canada is simply absurd in the extreme
5491919 of course its true that all the bse cases detected in canada have been through cfias surveillance cfia doesnt allow anyone else to test for bse but that hardly means that cfias testing program has been highly successful in demonstrating the low level of bse in canada the program instead has definitively shown that canada and the u s have inaccurately predicted numerous times over the past five years that bse has virtually been eliminated there
5491920 this fact demonstrates conclusively that the risk of importing bse cattle into the united states from canada is substantially greater than what usda has told the public
5491921 it is downright irresponsible for usda to continue to allow these older cattle that were born when bse was still circulating in the canadian feed system into the united states

5491935 very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
5491936 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5491937 i am sure that such a well conducted effective peacemaking operation aimed at protecting our citizens and other people will be among the most glorious deeds of the russian military
5491938 the world realized that even now there are political freaks who were ready to kill innocent people for the sake of political fashions and who compensated for their own stupidity by eliminating a whole nation
5491939 i think the russians will pull out but will damage georgia strongly

5492000 it was an interesting way for us to stay in touch with our visitors needs but a money losing proposition we needed advertising for the web business to be viable
5492001 it took about 20 minutes to set it up and that 20 minutes completely changed our business
5492002 in fact because the ads are so relevant to the content on any given page we believe that they are a very useful resource for our visitors this is evidenced by the fact that on many of our pages more than 10 percent of our visitors click through to the advertisers for more information
5492003 if you write expert content with your visitors needs in mind the rest will follow
5492004 nothing can show you how to do something as clearly and adeptly as a video
5492005 as we see the migration of advertising dollars from television to the web we expect video content and advertising to do very well
5492006 these analytics help us zero in on where were doing the best job and where we need to do more as a result our performance just keeps going up
5492007 our long term goal is not to have an adversarial relationship with russia but it cannot be business as usual
5492008 we have to take a look at all the elements of the relationship and this of course would include high level meetings
5492009 we dont want to hear that mikheil saakashvili is a saint
5492010 we hope it will be a balanced and responsible decision and that the us will not break all the glassware in our house
5492011 i think youll see a nato more united than you might expect
5492012 i think you can expect a strong message to russia
5492013 the foreign ministers will also probably send a message of solidarity and will agree on a package of measures
5492014 including the international mechanism to monitor respect of the engagements taken by both sides
5492015 the assumption in the past was that either you know how to look or you dont
5492016 this is not true you can train people to look educators as well as artists know that
5492017 quite often when students miss a diagnosis they tell us they didnt look
5492018 we trained students to become literate in talking to patients but we didnt have a way to make them be visually literate
5492019 you can look at a face and observe certain aspects of it like lines on a face the colour of it the colour of the eyelids the colour of the lips these are all things once you are trained to look for it you do better at it
5492020 not only how to look at body and face but to look at patterns the work of jackson pollock has no face and no body so what is important is pattern recognition
5492021 they have to be able to look at the human being they have to be able to pick up cues that are not necessarily communicated verbally so much is not communicated verbally
5492022 the common factor here which is the human is so subjective the science that we practise is so subjective that you have to train the physician to be good at both the human brings the science and the art together

5492275 but if the judge only trial is being brought in to deal with recent incidents of controversial figures and media excessive publicity we reject it for that reason
5492276 we say the real way of fixing up that problem is to allow questioning of jurors
5492277 we say how can a verdict possibly be beyond reasonable doubt if one juror simply doesnt agree

5492374 there are many in hollywood who dont want to be identified with the complexities that surround the state of israel
5492375 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5492376 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5492377 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5492378 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5492379 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5492380 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5492381 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5492382 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5492383 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5492384 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5492385 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5492386 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5492387 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5492388 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5492389 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5492390 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5492391 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5492392 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5492393 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5492394 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5492395 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5492396 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5492397 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5492398 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5492399 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
5492400 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
5492401 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
5492402 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
5492403 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
5492404 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5492405 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5492406 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5492407 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5492408 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5492409 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5492410 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5492411 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5492412 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5492413 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5492414 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5492415 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5492416 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5492417 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5492418 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5492419 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5492420 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
5492421 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
5492422 hey wouldnt it be great if we brought the other actors in here and got all of us interacting
5492423 they know they have another 20 to 25 good years in front of them and they want to make the most of that time they want to do something they can feel proud of work that gives them social reward
5492424 a life change such as this is a golden opportunity to review your financial picture
5492425 certainly its something to consider but there are numerous scenarios where it wouldnt make sense
5492426 if you had a mortgage at 5 and the after tax cost is 3 then why the hell would you pay it off
5492427 i think that the first thing that scares people off despite garrards performance last year is that he is qb for the run heavy jaguars
5492428 it is obviously one of the first things that pops into mind when you think jacksonville and im thinking that is the reason that garrard falls in many drafts
5492429 i am not 100 percent convinced garrard is going to be able to make the deep passes
5492430 the more garrard throws the ball the more likely he will be picked off it is just common sense
5492431 i am really betting on garrard throwing for a lot of touchdowns i put my money where my mouth is
5492432 the inspiration for c o r e comes from the teams love of the classic early video games like doom quake and half life

5492443 our progress during the last fiscal year was substantial the company s ability to self fund enshale s research and development while remaining profitable and debt free without diluting shareholders interests is a triumph the leeville mine s vast increase in royalties worked mightily to benefit our overall corporate development saving our shareholders from the potentially highly dilutive effects of outside financing to fund enshale s research and development of the company s oil shale project we are pleased that our fiscal 2008 ended with a positive bottom line we are working diligently to make our next year even more exciting and upward moving in all regards

5492455 were all in this together and the people of pakistan and the government of pakistan know that spokesman gordon johndroe said as mr bush spent time on his ranch near this tiny texas town
5492456 so were confident that while we certainly all have more to do when it comes to fighting terrorism the government of pakistan will continue in the effort he said after mr musharraf announced he would step down to avoid the first impeachment in the nuclear armed nations history
5492457 president bush looks forward to working with the government of pakistan on the economic political and security challenges they face the spokesman said adding that us aid would continue despite the political shifts
5492458 president bush appreciates president musharrafs efforts in the democratic transition of pakistan as well as his commitment to fighting al qaeda and extremist groups said mr johndroe
5492459 political instability in pakistan is not in the interests of pakistan nor the regional or international community
5492460 it is important that the government of pakistan now moves with purpose to tackle the security and economic challenges facing the country
5492461 hopes that the future president and the pakistan government can work together on developing and consolidating democracy in pakistan respecting the institutions and the rule of law it said in a statement
5492462 the european union will continue to support pakistan on this path snow mobiles
5492463 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
5492464 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
5492465 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
5492466 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
5492467 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5492468 this is a planning took where all things are going
5492469 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5492470 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5492471 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5492472 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5492473 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5492474 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5492475 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5492476 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5492477 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5492478 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5492479 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5492480 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5492481 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5492482 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5492483 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5492484 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5492485 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5492486 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5492487 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5492488 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5492489 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5492490 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5492491 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5492492 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5492493 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5492494 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5492495 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5492496 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5492497 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5492498 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5492499 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5492500 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5492501 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5492502 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5492503 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5492504 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5492505 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5492506 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5492507 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5492508 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5492509 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5492510 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5492511 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5492512 open up your exploration in algeria we have a bidding round going on we are open the u s also needs to open offshore florida offshore alaska need to be opened to exploration
5492513 is an area that may have large volumes of recoverable oil we think that the outer continental shelf will give access to new areas we think that part of this constraint on supply right now comes from areas that you cannot go and the u s is one area that is limited to increased exploration
5492514 the limits to future petroleum supplies have more to do with politics than with geology and resource availability for example the most promising acreage remaining in the u s is located offshore most of which is off limits to the industry
5492515 a must read for anyone interested in energy issues a debunkers bible
5492516 demolishes the many false promises that are promoted by those calling for energy independence
5492517 investigative reporter bryce who made mincemeat of enron executives perfidy in pipe dreams 2002 gives an equal shellacking to the old boy business government network long established in texas
5492518 looking at hindsight obviously we would do things differently today
5492519 were we perfect absolutely not weve had missteps and those are the lessons learned it was over the last few years that we were able to incorporate all of the lessons learned that we have throughout this investigation
5492520 his only response was that he wanted to hang out there which was not a very compelling reason
5492521 they had stiff alibis or they were not in a position to take the material for purposes of this kind
5492522 there are staff that are extraordinarily kind there are staff that are singling her out for special attention
5492523 theres nowhere she can go to be alone theres nowhere she can go to get peace
5492524 we feel shes well managed we havent heard about any outward threats by other prisoners we train our staff to treat all our prisoners equally
5492525 you get them on the train or get them at the next station
5492526 upper level of seating but it was not a full floor it had seating either side with a railing either side and a gap in the middle really interesting concept and a little puzzling for the aussie travellers
5492527 i dont know the types they sell i only know it soda
5492528 it is a pleasure and an honor to commemorate semtech s outstanding recent performance and new strategic journey by ringing nasdaq s opening bell
5492529 we are very proud to be a nasdaq global select company and having the opportunity to open the market is a tribute to the companies past achievements and recognition of the future opportunity that lies ahead of us we look forward to sharing this event with all semtech stakeholders
5492530 i know that the long delay getting information about this key person has caused some anxiety so hopefully to make up for the delay we have the permission from mr
5492531 with this major step complete we turn our attention to operations
5492532 ive been living in my body a lot longer than my daughter has in hers
5492533 truebluetitan has become my guiding light providing direction towards future goals
5492534 i was doing a bit of studying outside at my boyfriends place while he finished up watching a basketball game on tv
5492535 he started taking photos of me and he didnt think that id seen him but hes no
5492536 thats the trick as soon as im not happy doing it then

5492538 first the difference between ecmascript 3 1 and ecmascript harmony should be made clear 3 1 is a bug fix for the current javascript
5492539 harmony will pick up from 3 1 and try to introduce many of the types of features that were slated for es4 but with different syntax and from a different approach this is great news for everyone since it means that the standards body is going to be working toward a future that is deemed good or bad based on whats good for the language as it will exist in web browsers there is likely a mandate for the language outside of the browser environment but designing the next language in a vacuum of real world users of new syntax was going to hound the es4 effort that risk is now gone
5492540 first you can forget a lot of what you learned about ecmascript 4 previously many of the complicated concepts contained in the language have been tossed instead there is a considerable amount of effort going into making sure that new features will be easily duplicable through other means
5492541 it will feature many of the things es4 was trying to accomplish but may attempt them from different directions and will focus much more on incremental stepwise evolution of the language
5492542 the folks who have written it this way have gotten it wrong not least of all because they havent been sitting in the meetings and havent seen how the resulting differences come from good faith disagreements not simple strategic posturing
5492543 es4 as outlined last fall wasnt adobes language and there was no chance that es3 1 would have ever been as tepid as many assumed microsoft wanted it to be
5492544 im totally convinced that the decision was motivated by money and only money
5492545 this is a huge let down sic i cant believe that they are moving it back by nearly eight months
5492546 like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films
5492547 im totally convinced that the decision was motivated by money and only money
5492548 the client makes the decision i would have loved to litigate this
5492549 we feel that the song is only worth 1 00 as seen on itunes as such we are offestting the real cost of the purloined tune 1 and giving the bronx woman 55 dollars or whatever so she can buy our whole catalog off of itunes rhapsondy etc

5492588 you know what never mind i am tired of this conversation goodbye crazy rude girl
5492589 rika thought to herself shaking her fist towards the sky playfully another knock rika quickly looked back at the door her eyes shining as it creaked open
5492590 tak takahashi chan rika nearly shouted before covering her own mouth
5492591 ohhhh i would of never guess risa and takahashi but now that i think about it
5492592 oh no little lady dont you pretend like what you are doing isnt wrong gawking at those two shameless girls doing whatever there doing and their your juniors

5492608 i am never going to be able to meet the queen of hearts like this

5492610 if everybody minded their own business the world would go around a great deal faster than it does
5492611 you can take care of the baby since you seem so interested in my affairs and i have to get ready to meet with the queen anyways
5492612 had yuuko really been carrying a pig this entire time

5492620 the money screamed across the wires its provenance fading in a maze of electronic transfers which shifted it hid it broke it up into manageable wads which would be withdrawn and redeposited elsewhere obliterating the trail
5492621 i cant imagine you living under the kinds of threats these guys live under

5492630 willingness to dig deep no matter which politician is exposed
5492631 wnd has consistently stood by the stories and their authors
5492632 worldnetdaily has made every effort to ensure that its reporting in this series and in everything it has covered was fair honest truthful balanced and accurate
5492633 sources named in the publications have stated under oath that statements attributed to them in the articles were either not made by them were misquoted by the authors were misconstrued or the statements were taken out of context
5492634 corsi who had confirmed his appearance on todays political cesspool broadcast even after the recent media firestorm erupted had his publicist send us an email canceling his appearance which we received only a few minutes before his segment was scheduled to start this is the only information we received in the subject line we need to cancel for tonight travel plans have changed
5492635 confirmed his appearance on todays political cesspool broadcast even after the recent media firestorm erupted
5492636 the political cesspool in the past two years has become the primary radio nexus of hate in america
5492637 most jews regard jews and whites as two different races
5492638 it opens a big opportunity for the community to participate n learning without having the kids bussed out
5492639 theres going to be a lot of new kids in my class and theres going to be a new playground that i can play on
5492640 the rock has to be in my personal possession from the time i pick it up
5492641 when i get here i have to turn it over to army security and they ll secure it until the morning of the event
5492642 its a very gratifying day for the bats team and an important moment for the marketplace as a whole
5492643 as we have stressed repeatedly our motivation to become an exchange has come from our desire to participate directly in the national market system and compete on a level playing field with our primary competitors nasdaq and the new york stock exchange
5492644 an important milestone in the history of u s market structure
5492645 who worked diligently in processing our exchange application which helped us meeting our internal goal of obtaining exchange status before year end 2008
5492646 bats exchange status is more a benefit to its owners than anyone else as an exchange bats becomes a self regulatory organization sro instead of being regulated as a broker dealer
5492647 this of course will help bats economically the firm will get a larger share of market data revenue be able to enter the more lucrative options business and will no doubt help them with regulators as they expand globally it will provide bats with operational benefits as well such as the ability to distribute its own quotes with more revenue and deeper pockets bats is likely to become a more formidable competitor to nyse and nasdaq
5492648 i have never been happier in my life we are over the moon
5492649 i was not expecting to be pregnant on my wedding day but then ive always done things a little controversial
5492650 im with barack obama everything is on the table except privatization
5492651 we know that privatization drives takes away money from social security but everything else is on the table
5492652 supplementing the current social security system with personal accounts but not as a substitute for addressing benefit promises that cannot be kept
5492653 i was doing a bit of studying outside at my boyfriends place while he finished up watching a basketball game on tv
5492654 he started taking photos of me and he didnt think that id seen him b
5492655 i was doing a bit of studying outside at my boyfriends place while he finished up watching a basketball game on tv
5492656 he started taking photos of me and he didnt think that id seen him b
5492657 then through scalded eyes i seemed to see the hands free themselves of the nails and move slowly toward the soiled face
5492658 we need to make trade logistics and border infrastructure a priority in the short term or lose opportunities to other global competitors who are better organized to facilitate trade
5492659 on oil alone canada has been the largest supplier to the u s since 1999 not saudi arabia not kuwait nor any other producer from the organization of the petroleum exporting countries
5492660 canada is a stable supplier of energy to the u s whether it is gas and oil in the west or integrated electricity grids in the east
5492661 and being close means lower delivery costs than most other power suppliers
5492662 his agent said that hes been getting around 50 offers a day 49 of those are offers from cougars and gay dudes who want to do the body butterfly with him on their waterbeds you know who you are mom
5492663 good work usually arises when the creators seem to have no ambitions towards gilt culture but are involved in a kind of squandering beaverish endeavor that isnt anywhere or anything it goes always forward eating its own boundaries and likely as not leaves nothing in its path other than the signs of eager industrious unkempt activity
5492664 we really never expected to be on the gossip blogs and in the tabloid news because we dont really think that we are that cool that newsworthy you know what i mean
5492665 the mean girl i think at the end of the day everybody has to remember it is a tv show and it is a reality show but i feel that i am going to be redeemed in season four
5492666 i dont know i think that they are trying really hard to make a career for themselves and give themselves longevity beyond the hills and that is their way of doing it
5492667 i think that they are just different so there isnt really a comparison between them
5492668 behind all of these claims and positions by sen obama on iraq lies the ambition to be president
5492669 i would rather live in mccains world than obamas but i believe that we live in obamas world
5492670 her name is fun fun so you can imagine how much fun fun fun fun is
5492671 as you know admiral fallon was a voice of reason in an administration which has used inflammatory rhetoric with respect to iran and i am deeply concerned by indications that admiral fallons decision to resign may not have been his own
5492672 i believe it is in the interest of both our military and the policy making process for flag officers to be able to express their professional unfiltered advice to civilian leaders
5492673 his lord said unto him well done thou good and faithful servant thou hast been faithful over a few things i will make thee ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of thy lord
5492674 everyone in the whole world thinks its super creepy when adults have facebooks
5492675 facebook is all about being a reflection of real world relationships
5492676 the same thing youre experiencing with your daughter online is a reflection of how youre not a part of her social network in real life
5492677 i think everybody views my mom as a cool mom
5492678 im pretty open with her about my life i dont have to be too careful whatever i put on there i wouldnt mind her knowing
5492679 there is a concern that attacks over social networks are inevitable its just one more delivery mechanism
5492680 users are already using these social networks and theyre going to be in one form or another part of the business experience
5492681 what i think is important is the education of users
5492682 just like we had to educate users that they shouldnt click on attachments in e mail from somebody they didnt know theres just some best practices that were going to need to teach end users around these tools so that they better protect themselves
5492683 ive been thinking a lot about the quote the safest computer is one you bury underground you cover it with concrete and then probably no one will ever be able to break into it
5492684 but you dont get a lot of use out of the computer then
5492685 today more than three quarters of those radio airwaves or white space spectrum are completely unused
5492686 this vast public resource could offer a revolution in wireless services of all kinds including universal wireless internet
5492687 this is a huge opportunity to get connectivity to the american people particularly in rural areas i think it will make a huge difference to everybody
5492688 these devices could knock out wireless communications systems like headsets used by coaches and officials microphones used by referees to announce penalties and calls and microphones used by journalists to conduct interviews with athletes and coaches
5492689 im now in tottenham but no one can disagree with me wanting to follow my dream
5492690 we have two more weeks until the end of the transfer window and i think this will be the most important week
5492691 ive been living in my body a lot longer than my daughter has in hers
5492692 cessation of all cross border interventions and inter provincial claims of jurisdiction
5492693 one of the things that ive always said is that on this particular issue if you believe that life begins at conception then and you are consistent in that belief then i cant argue with you on that because that is a core issue of faith for you
5492694 the ccaa is a sketch an outline a supporting framework for the resolution of corporate insolvencies in the public interest
5492695 parliament wisely avoided attempting to anticipate the myriad of business deals that could evolve from the fertile and creative minds of negotiators restructuring their financial affairs
5492696 it left the shape and details of those deals to be worked out within the framework of the comprehensive and flexible concepts of a compromise and arrangement i see no reason why a release in favour of a third party negotiated as part of a package between a debtor and creditor and reasonably relating to the proposed restructuring cannot fall within that framework
5492697 while the notion of releases in favour of third parties including leading canadian financial institutions that extend to claims of fraud is distasteful there is no legal impediment to the inclusion of a release for claims based in fraud in a plan of compromise or arrangement
5492698 an interpretation of the ccaa that recognizes its broader socio economic purposes and objects is apt in this case
5492699 here the debtor corporations being restructured represent the issuers of more than 32 billion in non bank sponsored abcp notes
5492700 he was required to consider and balance the interests of all noteholders not just the interests of those who launched the appeal whose notes represent only about 3 per cent of that total that is what he did
5492701 weve spent so many resources and so much attention on iraq that weve lost sight of future threats down the road the current conflict between russia and georgia is a perfect example
5492702 the debate has got to shift as a result of this war

5492766 members of the orange order belong to the institution because they are firmly committed to their reformed protestant faith and in a world where secular values are changing the societies in which we live our faith is important to us
5492767 they might think they are being smart issuing that type of answer but it is showing that they are burying their heads in the sand many members have been very positive about the suggestion internally but nothing has happened at an official level yet

5492776 as far as i am aware it is the first time they have used semtex
5492777 it does not appear to be new semtex so it does not raise a concern with me that they have a new supply of semtex
5492778 it is significant in the sense that there was semtex in the explosive charge it did not go off but there was semtex there where it came from i dont know
5492779 it is similar to devices that used to be used in the province by other groups
5492780 but when it semtex was passed over to different groups how it came to be in their possession i dont know at this point in time
5492781 bid to exert control in nationalist areas in particular is continuing unabated
5492782 in the decade up to 2006 residential property prices in ireland rose more rapidly than in any other developed economy strong demand partly explains this incomes employment and population all grew robustly the increase in the supply of new housing was just as phenomenal the number of annual housing completions in 2006 was almost five times that of the early 1990s which compares with static output in the euro area and in the uk however when supply and demand fundamentals are considered in tandem the enormous increase in prices was unjustified consequently the countrys property market is now going sharply into reverse prices have been falling for 18 months and excess supply makes further declines all but inevitable in the event of an even sharper correction than is currently predicted the main lenders would probably suffer badly although irelands banks have been highly profitable over a long period and are thus well capitalised they are hugely exposed to the domestic property market the international credit crisis should it continue could cause serious financing problems for the banks adding to concerns about their balance sheets

5492793 nothing came of it and i was very disappointed by the response from adams in particular on friday i decided to send a text to martin mcguinness to again ask him to give that vital assistance and urge his fellow republicans to give the information that would convict the bombers but again he wouldnt agree to that but when sinn fein does take that step it will show that they are genuinely into peace and a system of justice which should protect everybody catholic and protestant

5492812 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5492813 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5492814 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5492815 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority
5492816 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies

5492827 down the line though these children do far worse that relationship of trust is broken

5492832 we argue that humans possess an innate system for enumeration that doesnt rely on words
5492833 basic number and arithmetic skills are built on a specialized innate system
5492834 our findings are consistent with the idea that we have an innate system for representing quantity ideas and that the lack of number words in a language should not prevent us from completing simple number and computation tasks
5492835 perhaps the most striking result comes from the cross modal matching task where the child has to put out the number of counters corresponding to a sequence of auditory events
5492836 this cannot be done using visual memory but requires the child to generate a mental representation that is abstract enough to serve to represent both auditory and visual enumeration
5492837 in order to demonstrate their desired conclusion the authors would need to evaluate an age group across languages with and without number words where the participants in the language with number words can succeed in getting close to 100 percent accuracy on the tasks then the effects of the absence of number words can be evaluated in the population speaking the language that lacks number words
5492838 in our recent work we have demonstrated that piraha speakers achieve high accuracy on matching tasks despite having no count words whatsoever not even a word for one

5492843 one year ago i didnt know what an rss feed was when i contacted dale mugford to build me a personal site since then ive worked with bnc on a number of custom wordpress themes and have whole heartedly recommended them to numerous others along with a killer site built within days to the very pixel of my photoshop mock up dale walked me through social media 101 teaching me how to be savvy in the social web and on my site through a series of video screen casts brave new code has gone from a one man show to an up and running web studio in the year i have know them and i have no doubt that they are on their way to great success
5492844 from the perspective of a start up brave new code was an invaluable component to launching our business on the right foot we lacked the expertise to get started on our own and were on a very tight budget but worked with dale to find a solution that was scaled to our economic situation as a symptom of trial and error bnc has made numerous adjustments to the site to adapt to our needs and to ensure that we remain excited about the product

5492873 if you imagine a chessboard on which the dark squares are shrubs and the light squares are grasses warming alone would tend to increase the size of the dark squares until the chess board is completely filled in
5492874 our experiment suggests that herbivores like caribou and musk oxen will slow this process inhibit it or perhaps even increase the size of the white squares on the chessboard
5492875 this discovery is quite surprising considering that musk oxen occur at such a low density at our site
5492876 careful management and conservation of existing populations of musk oxen and caribou as well as other large herbivores should be a priority in plans to mitigate the effects of climate change on ecosystems
5492877 until now these animals seem to have been regarded more as background noise than as an active component of the ecosystems response to warming
5492878 our results suggest that herbivores in the arctic and elsewhere may constrain the increase in shrub growth that is projected by current models of global warming their grazing could have important consequences for the ability of shrubs to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide insect outbreaks may become more frequent with future warming as well and our results also suggest an important role of such outbreaks in reducing shrubs
5492879 on the practical and policy sides of this story we need to be aware that the carbon dioxide sponge represented especially by shrubs and trees may not be as big as we thought it was this finding is yet another reason to think carefully about reducing carbon dioxide emissions

5492938 and then we would like to see him back at ajax as soon as possible
5492939 we look forward to working with them to continue the march of linux in all areas of computing
5492940 matt and his team have created an exciting distribution that has taken the world by storm
5492941 it is good that people are talking about grenoble i am happy for the club
5492942 this victory is going to give us some ideas making us work harder and improve
5492943 it is through matches like these that players and the club grow we can have a good championship
5492944 now it is going to be a big match for us at lyon but for them i dont believe it will be
5492945 there is nothing better for the confidence than winning matches and getting six points from six can only be good
5492946 you must take into account how difficult it is to win a match in ligue 1 so we must savour these wins because we will experience a lot more difficult periods during the season
5492947 our blogfather who art in tennessee hallowed be his blog
5492948 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5492949 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5492950 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5492951 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5492952 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5492953 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5492954 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5492955 there are no new or increased federal or state excise taxes
5492956 is it more important to find out what killed the dream or to apply lessons learned to your new dream in an effort to keep this one alive
5492957 some mafioso upset at having to sit in traffic you know like road rage but with guns or quarreling mafia families no one dared ask
5492958 you just learned to be low key and not flashy
5492959 anyone who works with her thinks how does this woman not have a show
5492960 regarding james it should be known that he was the bishop of jerusalem and named james the less because he had been called after another james
5492961 i took advantage of the fact that i was let go with time remaining on my contract first and foremost my number one priority was to spend time with my wife and kids an 8 year old son and 6 year old daughter to that end i was a reasonably well paid soccer dad
5492962 i took my kids to school every day i went to the gym i learned to cook and i trained for and ran the phoenix half marathon
5492963 i spent a lot of time watching hockey on the satellite dish and in a very different manner i wasnt watching it through the lens of a particular organization and i didnt necessarily look at specific players from the vantage point of how does this guy relate to players on our organization i just watched hockey in the pure sense it may sound a little funny but it improved my understanding of the game
5492964 i also stayed in touch with the game there were a lot of people who supported me and kept in contact with me there were opportunities along the way to jump back in with other organizations but the timing wasnt right or the job wasnt right i was waiting for a better opportunity to come along and thankfully for me this one did
5492965 i first met mike in 1995 when i worked for the jets and he was representing players and we began a relationship that grew over the years although in all the years i worked for both the jets and the coyotes i never negotiated a contract with him
5492966 when i saw that he gillis got this job i felt that there would be a chance that he would want me to be a part of it and fortunately for me he contacted me almost immediately after he got the job and thats why im here
5492967 obviously a big part of the job is management of the salary cap in order to be able to operate within the salary cap system you need to understand the value of hockey players
5492968 in order to function within this job from the cap management operational salary perspective you need to be part of the actual hockey decision that is being made the level of complexity of operating an nhl franchise has grown exponentially in the last 10 years particularly so with the advent of the salary cap today the job of a modern general manager is significantly more intricate than it used to be decisions are not made without a tremendous amount of forethought and planning
5492969 the fact that i have 13 years of management experience and have sat in the assistant gms chair in my immediate past allows me to be a sounding board for him as he goes through his own learning curve as he learns how to be a good general manager
5492970 having said that mike has an extremely good balance of intellect ego and understanding of the hockey world so he will operate just fine
5492971 i am extremely excited needless to say about the start of the season and if i had my druthers it would be starting tomorrow but it takes a great number of people to work a great number of hours and there is a tremendous amount to do before we get started so the fact that there is a little bit of time left between now and the start of training camp is probably a good thing
5492972 i love to eat my wife and i cant wait to explore vancouvers multicultural restaurants i am excited that my family is moving to the most beautiful city in north america and one of the premiere hockey markets in the world its very difficult for me to articulate just how excited i am to be here
5492973 bad fever with double pneumonia when i was five left me deaf
5492974 i would like to invite you for a tiny glimpse behind the curtain a glimpse into the dark world of my imagination into the nature of my fears into the nature of antichrist
5492975 we are training graduate students and typically what happens is students take their course work and do their research here and then go to other community sites to get their clinical training
5492976 we wanted to be able to offer some of that clinical training on site which enables us to more closely supervise the training they are getting
5492977 i know that the long delay getting information about this key person has caused some anxiety so hopefully to make up for the delay we have the permission from mr keyser to take the unusual step of essentially outlining his resume
5492978 with this major step complete we turn our attention to operations
5492979 the child support was the icing on the cake i couldnt believe that our son has to pay child support to his abuser

5492996 well thats a personal decision that you will have to make for yourself

5493073 one of my bosses at folha called me and said youre gonna be jo o gilbertos butler in any moment in the stories wed write about the concert we could tell how we got the information since wed have access to private moments with the two artists who didnt know we were journalists
5493074 small tape recorders at the time were as big as a common cassette tape there was no way to use one so i took notes in a notepad i kept in my trousers pocket but i couldnt take notes in front of anyone so i wrote when i was alone during the concert it was easy to write because it was dark and there was no one else in the backstage no one would notice the worst moment was in the dressing room there was i along with jo o gilberto and his manager they were sitting in a sofa and i was standing when he went to the stage to test the sound i took as many notes as i could still astonished for listening jo o gilberto play so near me
5493075 when it got published no one could understand how we could have quotes by jo o gilberto and there was no way to explain it i only know that when the arts section editor of a paper in rio knew there was a folha reporter backstage he decided not to publish anything about events produced by anyone involved in the production of that concert as a reprisal

5493100 henoch te aanvaarden als een bijbelse figuur een enkel levend mens is iets dergelijks als te aanvaarden dat adam de eerste mens was henoch was een soortnaam toegepast op en gedragen door een groot aantal personen in alle tijden en eeuwen en in elk ras en volk dit kan gemakkelijk worden afgeleid uit het feit dat de oude talmoedisten en de leraren van midrashim het in het algemeen niet eens zijn over hanokh de zoon van yered sommigen zeggen dat henoch een groot heilige was bemind door god en levend in de hemel opgenomen d i iemand die op aarde mukti of nirvana bereikte evenals boeddha deed en anderen nog doen en anderen beweren dat hij een tovenaar was een boze magi r dit bewijst slechts dat henoch of het equivalent daarvan zelfs in de tijd van de latere talmoedisten een term was die ziener adept in de geheime wijsheid enz betekende zonder enige omschrijving van het karakter van de titeldrager
5493101 een man met grote kennis een franse geleerde de sacy vindt in het boek van henoch verschillende heel merkwaardige beweringen die een ernstig onderzoek waard zijn zoals hij zegt bijvoorbeeld de schrijver henoch laat het zonnejaar bestaan uit 364 dagen en schijnt tijdperken van drie van vijf en van acht jaar te kennen gevolgd door vier aanvullende dagen die in zijn stelsel die van de dag en nachteveningen en de zonnestilstanden blijken te zijn waaraan hij later toevoegt ik zie maar n middel om ze deze absurditeiten te vergoelijken namelijk door te veronderstellen dat de schrijver een of ander fantastisch stelsel uiteenzet dat misschien heeft bestaan voordat de orde van de natuur in de tijd van de universele zondvloed werd veranderd volkomen juist en de geheime leer zegt dat die orde van de natuur zo is veranderd en de reeks van de mensheden op de aarde ook want zoals de engel uri l aan henoch zegt zie ik heb u alle dingen laten zien o henoch en alle dingen heb ik u geopenbaard gij ziet de zon de maan en hen die de sterren in de hemel leiden die al hun werkingen jaargetijden en verschijningen laten terugkeren in de dagen van de zondaars zullen de jaren worden verkort de maan zal haar wetten veranderen enz hfst lxxix ook in die tijd jaren v r de grote zondvloed die de atlanti rs wegvaagde en het hele aardoppervlak veranderde omdat de aarde haar as ging hellen kon de natuur in geologisch sterrenkundig en in het algemeen in kosmisch opzicht niet dezelfde zijn geweest juist omdat de aarde was gaan hellen zie hfst lxiv afd xi en noach riep drie keer met bittere stem hoor mij hoor mij hoor mij en hij zei de aarde zwoegt en wordt heftig bewogen ik zal beslist met haar ondergaan
5493102 heres to the crazy ones the misfits the rebels the troublemakers the round pegs in the square holes the ones who see things differently theyre not fond of rules you can quote them disagree with them glorify or vilify them but the only thing you cant do is ignore them because they change things they push the human race forward and while some may see them as the crazy ones we see genius because the ones who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world are the ones who do

5493126 but we do me and joe are both of voting age so we do endorse voting getting to know the issues learning about the candidates and making a decision for yourself
5493127 need to be prepared to deal with families who are waiting for a miracle
5493128 sensitivity to this belief will promote development of a trusting relationship
5493129 when youre a parent and youre standing over the body of your child who you think is dying you have to have that
5493130 i know that none of us are immune from anything
5493131 you cant say thats nonsense you have to respect that
5493132 its not that you dont want a miracle to happen its just that is not going to happen today with this patient
5493133 the mom was playing religious tapes in the room and obviously was very focused on looking for a miracle
5493134 caught her in the side of the head she had no pulse when they pulled her out of the water
5493135 we just cant shut that machine off then you know what we cant shut that machine off
5493136 you might have a family thats having a hard time and it might take another day and thats ok
5493137 by the end of the day if the weather cooperates we can probably get all of our tourists out of there
5493138 it was definitely frightening and there was a lot of whoa what are we going to do next and whats the morning going to bring
5493139 i woke up to people yelling weve got to get out of here
5493140 we booked it up a cliff in 10 seconds and we just saw this massive rush of water rage down the creek side
5493141 thats all it took just a few days of very heavy thunderstorms
5493142 looking at hindsight obviously we would do things differently today
5493143 were we perfect absolutely not weve had missteps and those are the lessons learned it was over the last few years that we were able to incorporate all of the lessons learned that we have throughout this investigation
5493144 his only response was that he wanted to hang out there which was not a very compelling reason
5493145 they had stiff alibis or they were not in a position to take the material for purposes of this kind
5493146 dreams come true without that possibility nature would not incite us to have them
5493147 we wanted our daughter to know her parents were married that was the big thing for us
5493148 our journey to parenthood was not easy cheap or fun
5493149 the result however has been the most amazing experience in the world being called daddy and dad by our loving daughter
5493150 all the realms involved with men are much more complex
5493151 for future generations knowing they can fall in love get married have a child absolutely that will become a way of life more than it is
5493152 as a couple with kids you really see the importance of it trying to get as many protections as you can
5493153 my relatives were screaming with excitement when they found out we were going to be parents
5493154 i think we still have something to prove to show america we can do a great job with these kids
5493155 legally being able to get married will help in some states but not others
5493156 its not going to happen in new york as the law stands now
5493157 you cant bring the surrogate into the state but we can make the arrangements fly the client elsewhere
5493158 there are more couples that had been holding off because of the marriage situation who are now starting to show up
5493159 adoption is not getting any easier surrogacy is getting easier
5493160 what weve tried to do is have consent forms that make it very clear what the intentions of the people are
5493161 whos going to be the mom whos going to be the dad what might happens if relationship ends if someone dies
5493162 if you dont have an exit strategy the usual result is that you have potentially several years of litigation which is extremely damaging to the child
5493163 its incumbent on everyone to be very thoughtful about entering these arrangements
5493164 as gay men so much depends on where you live what your social support system is like
5493165 our child will go to school with other kids with gay parents
5493166 i had a job option upstate but i knew hed be only kid like that there

5493170 today mccain was at another branch of brevard community college and said through a statement that theres some flip floppin going on
5493171 i know that earlier this year senator obama proposed cutting the nasa budget and delaying the timetable for our return to the moon and the mars mission
5493172 i believe that he later repudiated his own plan sometimes it is difficult to know what a politician will actually do once in office because they say different things at different times to different people this is a particular problem when a candidate has a short thin record on the issues as in the case of senator obama

5493174 gosh golly we sure do live in trying times what with war elections and social unrest all over but what im really concerned about is whether or not amy winehouse is still alive if only there were a college student who could sort through all the smoke and mirrors to deliver me the shallow celebrity news i crave
5493175 there is a trick or two to writing a 300 page book and typesetting it in two days one is to have two people work on the book and the other is to require only one word per page and that is what miekal and and i did on june 29th and 30th in west lima wisconsin we wrote a book of 300 collaborative pwoermds certainly the longest book of pwoermds ever and to my knowledge the only collaborative pwoermds ever made the pwoermd is a queer little literary beast one that combines the art of neologism with the practice of poetry the goal of the pwoermd is to provide the experience of a poem over the course of a single poem as a poetic form it is doomed to fail frequently but ts size makes the attainment of perfection at least possible the way miekal and i created texistence worked one of us wrote fragments of two words on facing pages of a page layout on a computer and the other added letters in any way to those words and then wrote two partial words of his own occasionally i wrote a starter word of only two letters which miekal had to work hard to make into something and occasionally i wrote him a starter word so seemingly complete that he wasnt sure what he could add it was great fun we worked on this for hours at a time i usually was working on another writing project simultaneously and miekal would turn the computer towards me when it was my turn and i would turn it back to him when it was his turn

5493183 in searching for a new enemy to unite us humanity we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill in their totality and in their interactions these phenomena constitute a common threat which as the enemy we fall into the trap about which we have already warned namely mistaking symptoms for causes all these dangers are caused by human intervention and it is only through changed attitudes and behaviour that they can be overcome the real enemy then is humanity itself

5493203 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5493204 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5493205 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5493206 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5493207 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5493208 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5493209 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home
5493210 the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5493211 sometimes its difficult to know what a politician will actually do once in office because they say different things at different times to different people
5493212 this is a particular problem when a candidate has a short thin record on the issue as is the case of sen obama
5493213 the younger kids are focusing more on their planning and problem solving while they are actually playing the game while adolescents are focusing less on their planning and strategizing and more on the here and now
5493214 the single best predictor of their skills is how much they had played video games in the past and how much they played now those were better predictors of surgical skills than years of training and number of surgeries performed
5493215 so the first question you might ask your surgeon is how many of these surgeries have you done and the second question is are you a gamer

5493224 duizenden jaren geleden wezen de maya het jaar 2012 a d aan als een tijd waarin onze ervaring van de tijd zelf zou veranderen zij wezen op een venster in de geschiedenis van de mensheid waarin we naar een nieuwe galactische frequentie zouden gaan met een overgang van de lineaire tijd naar wat we sferische tijd of holografische tijd zouden kunnen noemen
5493225 sri bhagavan heeft ook gesproken over dit galactische venster ook hij voorziet een grote overgang naar het gouden tijdperk in 2012 a d hij trok zelf die conclusie vanuit zijn visioenen en die van zijn medewerkers en zei verrast te zijn toen hij hoorde dat de maya kalender eenzelfde veranderingstijd aangeeft
5493226 volgens amma en bhagavan bevindt de mensheid zich op het ogenblik in een groot transformatieproces dat eindigt in of nog v r het jaar 2012
5493227 want volgens de offici le biografie maakte men deze wapens om zich tegenover duitsland te kunnen verdedigen omdat men dacht dat duitsland een atoombom aan het maken was wat niet zo was

5493360 simply put the commerce clause precludes discrimination at any level of the three tiers including the retailer level granholm emphatically embraced this nondiscrimination principle and no basis exists for the states and wholesalers misguided efforts to limit granholms scope
5493361 by judicially extending the texas retailer permits to out of state retailers the district court imposed a condition the wholesaler purchase requirement which has the effect of barring out of state retailers from texass direct shipping market the reason is this it is legally impossible for an out of state retailer to purchase wine from a texas wholesaler without establishing a store in texas the supreme court has made clear however that a state cannot require an out of state business to establish a physical presence within its borders in order to participate in interstate commerce the district courts remedy imposes precisely such a discriminatory physical presence requirement
5493362 the very cynical post granholm games played by the wholesalers have cut off consumers in most states from thousands of fine wines they otherwise would have access to
5493363 we are fortunate to live in a country where laws that ignore the u s constitution for simple economic gain and to the detriment of citizens rarely survive the balanced scales of justice
5493364 there are some very innovative and proven solutions available to prevent hospital acquired conditions
5493365 our goal with the prevention above all campaign is to help healthcare providers understand the benefits of these solutions and provide the evidence they need to be assured that they offer both clinical and cost effectiveness
5493366 implementing innovative solutions is a major challenge for healthcare providers many are typically slow adopters when it comes to trying new equipment or different ways of working
5493367 providing targeted interventions that translate research findings into practice will allow healthcare providers to try new technologies with confidence

5493370 in 2006 and 2007 we held the very successful blue room art glass exhibitions in 2008 were building on the strengths of those projects and through the vision and passion of some very talented people were putting together what will be an amazing experience individually any of these artists and designers would offer an exiting exhibition but with pieces from all of them brought together in such a functional way this will be a really interesting way to view their works and a whole lot of fun
5493371 i wanted to create something technically contemporary an exotic image with a sense of purity i was inspired by the botanical elements and started to think of a garden the working process was an organic one there were key elements i started with and i worked through what worked and what didnt
5493372 the bar had to be able to break into four pieces and be as light as possible so that it could be easily transported plus it had to be self contained so that it was functional with no running water and had space for the likes of waste containers and standardised sinks
5493373 i wanted the key elements to be subtle and more than what you see at first glance the result is a 4m x 1m bar that is a clean black box made from perspex however within the hollow facia of the bar there are a number of compartments based on the botanicals that over time each gradually light up and fade out
5493374 the work ive created for the bombay sapphire botanical bar is an extension of my previous work based on leaf sculptural forms although slightly larger in scale i have created six pieces working with the theme of the different botanicals as it was difficult to create a physical representation of the botanicals i instead used colour to evoke the feeling of the botanicals
5493375 i wanted to examine how the botanicals were used around the world in a traditional way and the similarities between different cultures in how they negotiate the natural world for example angelica leaves were used to make protective amulets and almonds were always served in odd numbers for luck
5493376 the 6m long light is made from a skin of two interlocking translucent spirals which were originally developed on a smaller scale in a set of wooden bowls we have repeated the pattern and structure on different scales in exactly the same way in which nature does as it forms the basis of life

5493393 the supreme courts desire to promote the homosexual lifestyle at the risk of infringing upon the first amendment right to free exercise of religion is what the public needs to learn about

5493399 people like my mom you expect them to be upset people who are doing a lot of saving now versus people who are done saving are two very different groups
5493400 i shop at the 99 cent stores there are ways of saving money

5493402 the feds rate cuts geared to aiding ailing homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages have come at the expense of savers and retirees dependent on fixed income
5493403 for the past 12 months there has been a double whammy for savers as interest rates have fallen and inflation has increased
5493404 the gap in revenue per employee between google and sap and salesforce com for instance indicates that google would more likely be more interested in what ebay does or in monetizing youtube than in zoho or salesforce coms barely profitable business companies invest in what generates the best return on investment
5493405 googles margins are a once in a lifetime occurrence and google will move in that high growth direction thats why microsoft is so desperate about search it has a higher growth rate we are more worried about microsoft than google microsoft will address the internet but pulling down office margins is a challenge for them no company peacefully accepts a lowering of margins
5493406 our intention is to help erode microsofts profit margin coming in from below
5493407 if salesforce is a proxy it would be difficult for google to justify the investment more costs are associated with support than in r amp d even with on demand software the moment you have paying customers the expectations are different and google is finding that out with recent gmail problems
5493408 one of the privileges we enjoy as a private company is to not disclose revenue profit numbers which lets us do the kind of analysis on competitors they cant do on us
5493409 but for us our signals need to get to our audience so its a different world and its not acceptable for there to be any interference

5493411 spectrum is very valuable and we want to make sure its being used as efficiently as possible
5493412 the idea of trying to utilize the white spaces from a consumer perspective would be a good win for everyone
5493413 when you look at low power fm or ultrawide band rules the technology has great promise but the commission adopted rules that constrained it to the detriment of consumers
5493414 so of course there are concerns that that the rules could be too limiting
5493415 some companies claim that geolocation based technology has proven that it can interference with existing spectrum holders
5493416 the nab may claim it is afraid of interference but the reality it members dont want to give up control of airwaves they believes are theirs

5493419 it cleans out all the trees it gives people a little work to do and it gets the tourists out of here for a few days
5493420 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5493421 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5493422 ive got a generator and ive got a concrete home that i built myself so i know it can withstand this
5493423 every hurricane that we have we have additional lessons learned and experience
5493424 need to be prepared to deal with families who are waiting for a miracle
5493425 sensitivity to this belief will promote development of a trusting relationship
5493426 when youre a parent and youre standing over the body of your child who you think is dying you have to have that
5493427 i know that none of us are immune from anything
5493428 you cant say thats nonsense you have to respect that
5493429 its not that you dont want a miracle to happen its just that is not going to happen today with this patient

5493445 there is no justice for someone in a nursing home

5493459 provide a high quality palatable diet getting calves to consume an adequate ration
5493460 you will need to interact with those calves to alleviate depression and stress

5493465 we think the probability of tax system change taking place in next april is relatively high
5493466 some corporates may start hedging their exposure a few months earlier once they become 100 sure of the tax system change taking place although this japanese yen buying flow is not going to have any impact on fx market in this year it is worth following the developments
5493467 if it is materialized it is likely to have a meaningful impact
5493468 we do not expect major impact on dollar yen or euro yen
5493469 as a result there would not be a rush of repatriation just before the expiration of a temporary tax cut

5493472 we talked about it for a long time last night we looked at every statistic that we kept from pass completions yards per catch yards after catch interceptions percentage of drives scoring good practices and bad practices we even consulted with some of the players
5493473 really when you look at all the data jordan steffy has earned the spot he was ahead in almost every category
5493474 we rotated the quarterbacks with all the teams for the last nine practices so everybody had an equal shot with every team
5493475 i think theres a credibility thing here if you dont reward kids for practicing well then i dont know what you can base your decision on what made it hard is that chris played well in the games but based on not only fall practice but i even went back to spring practices steffy was far and away ahead in all the statistics
5493476 perhaps the most critical issue facing public education in a generation
5493477 we have got to go away and grow away from the callow and puerile philosophy that this situation will go away its frightfully difficult but will be richly rewarding if we work together we can find workable sensible and achievable ways to get through this period

5493490 ninety percent of patients with huntingtons disease have chorea and many suffer terribly its hard to describe the torment that these people undergo we had several patients who experienced a dramatic improvement in their quality of life some patients who hadnt been able to attend church for years were able to do so others were able to go out to a restaurant and have a meal for the first time in years its impossible to over emphasize what this has meant to some patients who are able to reclaim part of the life that they have lost due to this disease
5493491 patients and families with huntingtons disease maintain a courageous hope for progress
5493492 on one hand the fda approval of tetrabenazine represents only a small step forward this medication helps patients control their movements better but is not known to slow the underlying progression of the disease on the other hand the fda approval represents a giant symbolic breakthrough since tetrabenazine is the first drug ever approved in the united states for any aspect of huntingtons disease it is an honor to be part of the extended community of patients families and researchers trying to find a better way forward
5493493 my mother and many others have died without the benefits of tetrabenazine
5493494 since the medication was invented in the 1950s worldwide it has been give to close to a million people we have a tremendous amount of information about its benefits potential side effects how to treat the side effects and dosing suggestions this is day to celebrate for huntingtons patients and their families

5493531 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem

5493533 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5493534 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

5493539 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5493540 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5493541 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5493542 who are open to doing something on the production side
5493543 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue

5493545 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5493546 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5493547 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5493548 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

5493563 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5493564 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5493565 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5493566 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5493567 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5493568 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5493569 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5493570 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain

5493573 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5493574 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5493575 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5493576 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

5493611 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5493612 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5493613 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5493614 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5493615 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5493616 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5493617 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5493618 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5493619 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5493620 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5493621 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5493622 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5493623 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5493624 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5493625 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5493626 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5493627 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5493628 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5493629 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5493630 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5493631 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5493632 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5493633 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5493634 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5493635 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5493636 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5493637 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5493638 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5493639 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5493640 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5493641 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5493642 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5493643 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5493644 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5493645 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5493646 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5493647 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5493648 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5493649 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

5493654 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5493655 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5493656 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5493657 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

5493670 it would be a major waste to the economy and the soul of the community to let the concerts just fade away

5493769 those words that he uttered show that he doesnt fear consequences because he doesnt see these consequences in society the man in the street doesnt feel retribution because people get away with crime
5493770 even worse is that the people who are supposed to be role models are the perpetrators of crime so children especially boy have no one to look up to
5493771 children are subjected to a lot of pro violence messages displayed by leaders who are icons of how to deal with conflict situations its a monkey see monkey do situation
5493772 these messages are imprinted on the minds of impressionable children and the message is that crime pays
5493773 does he come from a climate of domestic violence is he exposed to gang or neighbourhood violence violence begets violence
5493774 usually this type of behaviour shows an underlying emotional need this is a child crying out for help
5493775 there could be underlying depression that he is externalising by acting out unresolved issues in his life that he cant articulate
5493776 the number of cases in which children have been resorting to violence and killing other children has been increasing over the past two years
5493777 when one looks at a child that commits such a crime one will find that the child has a lot of anger children do not know how to resolve conflicts and instead of being taught how to resolve disagreements they resort to violence
5493778 when a child does not have a mentor or someone to add positive input in his life he then tends to go by what he sees in society
5493779 children must be taught about respecting others viewpoints and other basic values to prevent them from turning to violence

5493816 we argue that humans possess an innate system for enumeration that doesnt rely on words
5493817 basic number and arithmetic skills are built on a specialized innate system
5493818 our findings are consistent with the idea that we have an innate system for representing quantity ideas and that the lack of number words in a language should not prevent us from completing simple number and computation tasks
5493819 perhaps the most striking result comes from the cross modal matching task where the child has to put out the number of counters corresponding to a sequence of auditory events
5493820 this cannot be done using visual memory but requires the child to generate a mental representation that is abstract enough to serve to represent both auditory and visual enumeration
5493821 in order to demonstrate their desired conclusion the authors would need to evaluate an age group across languages with and without number words where the participants in the language with number words can succeed in getting close to 100 percent accuracy on the tasks then the effects of the absence of number words can be evaluated in the population speaking the language that lacks number words
5493822 in our recent work we have demonstrated that piraha speakers achieve high accuracy on matching tasks despite having no count words whatsoever not even a word for one

5493841 most working families today do not have homes that have anywhere near 10 rooms john mccain has 10 houses many working people in america have to work two and three jobs to provide for their families and pay their car loans john mccain hops on a private jet is it any wonder why mccain champions a george bush agenda of cutting taxes for corporations and the wealthy helping oil companies turn record profits and leaving working families to fend for themselves mccains velvet world leaves him utterly unprepared to make the tough choices we need to restore the middle class
5493842 one of the most sweeping yet little noted changes that has occurred in american life over the past several decades and especially within the last couple of years has been the ever rightward drift of the nations highest courts on economic issues

5493936 the reason he spent so much of his life and ministry critiquiting the pagan philosophies of the world and exposing the aberrant theologies of the church was that augustine understood only too well that those things matter not only in the realm of eternity determining the spiritual destiny of masses of humanity but in the realm of the here and now determining the temporal destiny of whole civilizations

5493955 the release of this game represents a considerable success for adam and his team at dark rock
5493956 at newport we believe its essential to maintain close links with the computer games industry to enable our students to successfully find jobs when they graduate we already have graduates working for major games companies such as sega and blitz and this year sees the first woman graduate from the course

5493988 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5493989 the level of objectivity at nbc news has fallen so low that reporters are now giving voice to unsubstantiated partisan claims in order to undercut john mccain
5493990 mitchell did what has become a pattern for her of simply repeating obama campaign talking points
5493991 mccain was in a motorcade to the event and then held in a green room with no broadcast feed
5493992 mitchell is repeating uncritically a completely unsubstantiated obama campaign claim that john mccain somehow cheated
5493993 instead of trying to substantiate this blatant falsehood in any way andrea mitchell felt that she needed to repeat it on air to millions
5493994 cone of silence is a silly term i used from maxwell smart

5494042 political instability in pakistan is not in the interests of pakistan nor the regional or international community

5494060 he is no lesser a hero for us we will welcome him as if he has won us a gold medal because he is a diamond in himself
5494061 before the match started we had collected fire crackers to celebrate so what if he didnt win this time we will welcome him with these crackers on his arrival
5494062 the fellow who beat akhil bhai was just too defensive our boys fight with attack

5494064 we did not think it would seam or swing that much since the breeze was strong we expected it to swing throughout the day which it did there was a fair bit in the wicket to start off
5494065 the sri lankan bowlers bowled really well they got the first two batsmen out it was not like the batsmen played bad shots and got out credit goes to their fast bowlers they got wickets later on mendis applied the pressure you cant play catch up when you lose so many early wickets
5494066 its difficult to pick him he is a very unusual bowler even if you pick him by the time you realise what ball it is it gets really late to play a big shot the only option right now is to play more and more of him thats the only way of getting better
5494067 i thought we bowled pretty well and kept a lot of pressure on the indian batsmen
5494068 it wasnt an easy wicket even when we were batting but we managed to get through which is the most important
5494069 i would have still batted knowing the first 45 minutes is tough if they had gotten through that period and got 225 on the board it would have been a much tougher score to chase down than this with the new ball its always going to do a bit
5494070 im happy that i managed to finish the game off thats the important thing
5494071 once he saw what the others were jumping he got jittery
5494072 were going to try our hardest not to be violent
5494073 i didnt really know i was third overall till the last lap when i saw it on the board i had to work real hard in the first moto after i fell early in the second moto i got a better start and the bike was working good i think my improvement comes down to sitting on the couch for six months i was motivated to come back and show people what i can do the goal was to get to my previous fitness and get strong again the sand is tougher for me im glad we had a chance to get to ride in some this week in preparation for next week at southwick
5494074 i was in a pile up in the first corner i hit my teammate ivan tedesco there was a bunch of us i know i have to be on my game with how close the points are when i got up after the first turn i knew i had a lot of work ahead of me when i started passing guys my fitness stayed good so i was happy i really want to beat tim ferry i have fun racing him thats my motivation i thought the track was great it was really rough probably the roughest ive seen all year i knew i had second overall but i was surprised when i saw it
5494075 i wanted to celebrate in style so i ran the number one on my back in the first moto i was a little nervous but once i got out there i felt comfortable i want to come back to defend my title we got a lot of things were working on i just kept putting in consistent laps i found a really good line in the sand whoops and made up a lot of time i could feel the finish getting closer so i started to get excited it really just feels good this has been my toughest season all the struggles before and everything i went through to get back healthy it really makes this championship special to me this is one of the best tracks weve ridden all year i really want to thank kawasaki for all the hard work theyve put in
5494076 its good to see young riders come in and have the speed to run up front i could see ryan villopoto coming up behind me i just couldnt hold him off i was hoping to get second in a moto but im happy with third i knew he had the championship locked up so i wanted the best finish i could get the last three weeks off was really good for me im 100 percent as far as race condition goes
5494077 i just came down the first downhill and i was pushing hard i think i hit a wet spot the next thing i know i was rolling on the ground i was trying to steal the win from ryan dungey at his home track he did it to me so i wanted to return the favor i made a mistake i didnt know exactly where i needed to finish but i had an idea i just wanted to finish second because i knew i could catch them i didnt want to give up a spot i wanted to try before the checkered flag and i got it
5494078 it feels good washougal was first and i was pumped on that they are two different tracks ryan villopoto is fast here and he proved it today it feels good to be in the middle seat though it hasnt happened a lot i ended up sitting good on both starts which was nice this week was easier the second moto in the last race villopoto was on my tail the entire time today i could see where i was at and just ride to the checkers i was pumped on the track it was rough the roughest yet but they did a good job maintaining it two months ago i was just settling for second i had to believe in myself to get where i am now and compared to last year when i didnt win at all im thankful to be healthy and having success

5494102 there are bad storms and there are nice ones and this is a nice one
5494103 it cleans out all the trees it gives people a little work to do and it gets the tourists out of here for a few days
5494104 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5494105 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5494106 ive got a generator and ive got a concrete home that i built myself so i know it can withstand this
5494107 every hurricane that we have we have additional lessons learned and experience
5494108 this is a broad really diffuse storm all the florida keys and all the florida peninsula are going to feel the effects of this storm no matter where the center makes landfall

5494120 since the foreign ministers office responded to our invitation to join us and said that we have good intentions we now fully expect to reach gaza
5494121 your claim that the residents of the gaza strip are suffering from hunger is groundless
5494122 only 43 5 of basic commercial food import needs were met during the period between 3 and 30 december 2007
5494123 the stranglehold on gazas borders has made the work of the un and other humanitarian agencies virtually impossible only a trickle of medicine food fuel and other goods is being allowed in the israeli blockade of gaza has made people highly dependent on food aid and brought the health system and basic services such as water and sanitation near to collapse
5494124 for too long the middle east has been governed by zero sum logic one sides loss was seen as the others gain this thinking has brought much suffering to our region
5494125 despite how it may seem this blog is not a sentinel slam party we are not calling for the sentinel to cease its existence but rather to cease its existence as a shoddy paper the things that are said in this blog are said in hopes of sharing frustration calling out for change and calling out the orlando sentinel and its owners on its current product in hopes that they will take a little notice of the city that said all people posting here want very much to have a local paper and think it would a travesty for the city to be without one but we dont want just any scraps of newsprint to call itself our paper the authors of this blog want a paper that cares about the community enough to investigate cares about journalism enough to report real news and cares about the residents enough not to insult our intelligence with a tabloid esque newspaper
5494126 theres a lot of talk about canceling subscriptions which in my opinion will make things worse my dad had a couple of daily subscriptions when i was a kid plus the chicago sunday papers so i could no more live without a daily fix than i could live without breathing even if the sentinel is whittled down to eight pages total which it may be if too many people cancel this is when we need your support were struggling for our lives and our livelihoods no papers who would be the government watchdog who would compile the obits how would you keep up with the arts im hoping gas prices have hit their high and im hoping that newspapers have hit their low

5494129 we have announced a reduction in force to our newsroom staff in orlando
5494130 what lisa should have said is that we have no further reductions planned beyond that
5494131 we chose to do it the way we did unfortunately there was a mistake
5494132 they didnt take money it goes to heaths daughter thats extraordinary and wonderful and when youre part of that you think ah this is maybe why i went into the movies in the beginning i thought it would be full of wonderful people and weve got a movie full of wonderful people who did extraordinary things to help

5494139 at my old high school i could just throw the ball to kelly and not worry about it now i have to try and score too its taught me how to be a leader and how to step up and make big plays
5494140 from a work ethic stand point the amount of time she puts into ball handling and conditioning
5494141 i would easily put her in time off the floor with ashley houts georgia and maya moore connecticut you always preach it in practice but rarely do you have a kid thats working in the driveway on their own
5494142 everyone has to learn so that they can one day teach
5494143 our long term goal is not to have an adversarial relationship with russia but it cannot be business as usual
5494144 we have to take a look at all the elements of the relationship and this of course would include high level meetings
5494145 we dont want to hear that mikheil saakashvili is a saint
5494146 we hope it will be a balanced and responsible decision and that the us will not break all the glassware in our house
5494147 i think youll see a nato more united than you might expect
5494148 i think you can expect a strong message to russia
5494149 the foreign ministers will also probably send a message of solidarity and will agree on a package of measures
5494150 including the international mechanism to monitor respect of the engagements taken by both sides
5494151 we will do whatever is necessary and no one should have any illusion
5494152 the russian side is gravely violating the conditions provided for by the peace accord signed by the presidents of georgia france and the russian federation
5494153 and you who were already conquered in your greatest victories what will you be in the approaching defeat
5494154 you know youre never too old to burn your bridges because i believe i have offended everyone i think ive got a couple more ill burn that bridge when i come to it is my favourite phrase ive ever coined
5494155 random house made the decision to cancel its us publication of the novel the jewel of medina after much deliberation and with great reluctance
5494156 the decision was based on advice from scholars of islam among several creditable sources that publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community and could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
5494157 this is a work that absolutely stopped at nothing in order to desecrate something that all muslims hold sacred
5494158 firmly by our responsibility to support our authors and the free discussion of ideas even those that may be construed as offensive by some
5494159 however we must weigh that responsibility against others that it also bears and in this instance we decided not to go forward with this publication out of concerns for the author employees of random house booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the novel
5494160 womens empowerment never a popular theme among fundamentalists of any faith
5494161 i love the joyous ska rocksteady ness of ba ba boom and what i describe as the very post rare groove feel of the wonderfully named my sneaker collection weighs a ton
5494162 im not going to comment specifically on what russian units or equipment are in the area right now
5494163 but let me be clear if it rolled in after august 6 it needs to roll out that would be in keeping with the russians commitment on withdrawal
5494164 anything such as that or any other military equipment that was moved in would be in violation of this ceasefire and should be removed immediately
5494165 we will continue to closely monitor russian actions in georgia for confirmation of the withdrawal this is something that should be achieved without delay
5494166 uri and adjoining areas have no hurriyat presence then how does one explain this development
5494167 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century
5494168 now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
5494169 these are not credible allegations especially coming from the head of an organization like nato which has itself used not just disproportionate force but force against civilian targets and the civilian population especially in its conflict with yugoslavia in 1999
5494170 a valuable forum for dialogue to resolve complex political issues
5494171 are you aware that colds flu most sore throats and bronchitis are caused by viruses did you know that antibiotics do not help fight viruses its true plus taking antibiotics when you have a virus may do more harm than good taking antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment
5494172 a lot of the time people dont consider violence as a public health issue

5494186 ho ho nothing much nothing much a friend invited me out on his yacht would you like to see the pictures of me in my swim trunks looking terribly genki and european

5494189 well i liked parts of the movie but why did they have to keep making those dumb homophobic jokes all the time
5494190 but there was only one female character and she was just a sex object
5494191 thats miffys black friend hastily introduced in the late seventies
5494192 miffys black friend who might as well be called nakeesha or something else white people think of as a black name
5494193 in formal conversation or only in the same way that an english speaker would insert pure onomatopoeia into casual conversation
5494194 kon kon is used because in japan generally two knocks only are appropriate when knocking on doors

5494198 the whole apparatus of stirrups and attendants and gowns seem s more reminiscent of a sci fi alien abduction scene than the friendly attitude of a good doctor
5494199 then he just stood there in front of me and i kept on staring at him the only thing i could think of was turkey neck and gizzards and i felt very depressed

5494204 a graduate of the john kerry bible college barack obama is true to form
5494205 with a straight face obama chastised others for not abiding by the precepts of matthew 25 when he had a chance to do the same and failed for example instead of choosing to protect and care for the least of his brothers the unborn by supporting a bill that would protect those born alive after failed abortion attempts he voted against the bill who among us is more vulnerable and needy than an infant unborn or otherwise obama the christian said he would not yield when it comes to a womans right to have her baby slaughtered to obama americas greatest moral failure isnt that babies are murdered its that our wealthy and powerful country isnt giving more money to the poor never mind that americans give billions of dollars in charity each year uncoerced by the government
5494206 socialist types trying to appeal to christians often cite jesus earthly ministry of physically feeding the poor and healing the sick never mind that these acts were signs pointing to spiritual feeding and healing or that these social types conveniently leave out all that scary stuff about gods judgment against the unrepentant they can quote chapter and verse on helping the least of my brothers with more taxpayer supported government programs but ignore the reality of christs judgment on the world or the need to accept christ to avoid that judgment but i digress the point is this christian acts of charity are to be done on an individual level and the nature of that giving is voluntary in matthew 25 christ wasnt commending believers and condemning unbelievers based on what they rendered unto caesar he was referring to individual acts of kindness those who love god are willing do does obama really believe christ had government in view in matthew 25 that spending even more tax dollars on the needy fulfills gods requirement for christians to care for the poor in their congregations from what ive read and heard obama believes in a jumbled social gospel mess thats based on theological ignorance

5494209 he does not stand to gain in any manner even if he withdraws support it will not make a difference as we have the requisite numbers besides we have not gone back on any promises
5494210 if he wanted to go with the bjp he could have gone soon after the elections because the two put together have the numbers to form the government but since most of his people have been elected after defeating the bjp they will not support him

5494256 i started out as an assistant director working on taste of life after receiving about four months of training with staff from the bbc cambodia
5494257 film crews will need a producer a fixer good technicians and so on for their films so we want to train cambodians to do these jobs
5494258 if people can successfully film here it means there is stability and security in the country
5494259 if there are film crews it means that there are hotels restaurants roads and hospitals

5494276 our cremations in total volume with our funeral homes have doubled and thats primarily due to the cost of ground burial and entombment

5494314 our quarterly economic forecast highlights a significant worsening in uk economic prospects there is now a distinct possibility of technical recession
5494315 our view is that the threats to growth are more serious and more immediate than the risks of higher inflation the uk economy urgently needs an interest rate cut to counter threats of recession

5494397 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5494398 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5494399 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5494400 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5494401 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5494402 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5494403 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home
5494404 the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5494405 sometimes its difficult to know what a politician will actually do once in office because they say different things at different times to different people
5494406 this is a particular problem when a candidate has a short thin record on the issue as is the case of sen obama

5494412 dat ik zijn zoontje had durven uitlachen op hetzelfde moment dacht ik aan het feit dat hij eens moest weten waarvoor hij zoontje aan het opvoeden was voor helemaal niets
5494413 wel mijnheer verbene heeft het zo altijd over ene man in het leven van zijn dochter een man die zij had leren kennen in leuven een man met de naam grootveld ik dacht dat u om die reden maar eens met hem moest gaan spreken
5494414 wel ik ben al enkele jaren samen met deheer verberne eigenlijk sinds hij hier onverwacht is komen prediken nadat hij was overgeplaatst van antwerpen naar gent
5494415 ja hij kreeg een brief van zijn dochter over een situatie die uit de hand zou lopen
5494416 goedemiddag heer grootveld fijn dat u tijd voor mij vrij wilde maken
5494417 ik begreep van aya dat u weet waarom u hier bent
5494418 u zit hier omdat u meer weet over de situatie waarin madeleine verkeerd ik weet dat u madeleine al geruime tijd kent via de universiteit leuven ook weet ik dat u beiden bij de zogenaamde orde van de campus zit daar beter bekend als de westpointers allereerst wil ik uw dank betuigen van het feit dat u mijn madeleineke heeft losgeweekt van het verraderlijke web toch zit zij nu weer zwaar in de problemen mijnheer grootveld een probleem waar ook u bij betrokken bent naar ik van haar begrijp u bent namelijk niet zo maar hier vertelde madeleineke mij
5494419 ik begrijp uit uw woorden dat u haar elke dag nog spreekt
5494420 u heeft inderdaad gelijk dat ik in een probleem ben betrokken waar ik liever niet in had gezeten een probleem waarvan u ook de oorzaak wel kent neem ik aan ik ben inderdaad de uitverkoren persoon door de orde om haar te zoeken
5494421 je bedoelt om haar uit te leveren aan dat boevenpak
5494422 zo zou je het kunnen zien de orde is er namelijk achter gekomen wie er achter de moord op de grote leider marcus demilinis zit althans ze hebben een sterk vermoeden wie het is
5494423 weet dat madeleine niet van haar vriend hield maar van u u was haar grote liefde ten tijde van de studie alleen ze wilde niet meer aan de orde verbonden zijn ze wilde weg bij het gebeuren en begon het te haten zo erg dat ze uiteindelijk marcus liet omleggen nu zal ik u vertellen waar ze is niet meer in gent zoals u wel dacht ze is drie dagen geleden vertrokken naar middelburg om daar te schuilen ver weg van de orde ik weet dat u haar achterna zult gaan om haar te zoeken ik hoop dat u onderweg de juiste keuze maakt en haar weer zult helpen mijnheer grootveld
5494424 matysh dit was een deel van wat je te wachten staat haal madeleine terug en zuiver uw eigenste naam er zitten nog drie kogels in het pistool deze kunnen alle drie van u worden mits u madeleine spoedig vind ik ben zo vriendelijk geweest om u al vast in de juiste richting te wijzen

5494430 it is a quiet start to the week for the markets in terms of economic data and indeed for the week as a whole things could be relatively patchy which should mean little prospect of a re think in terms of the interest rate outlook in developed markets

5494435 power and money in the democratic party is being centralized around a key iconic figure obama is consolidating power within the party
5494436 i was the polling adviser for the democratic leadership council back then
5494437 clintons candidacy and that effort was very much focused on addressing the historical problems of the democratic party
5494438 clinton became very identified with the presidential wing of the party
5494439 but there was a lot of resentment from the daschle and gephardt people to the way they were treated by the clinton people i think the people who acted in clintons name didnt generate an awful lot of goodwill for them

5494450 the device did not operate in terms of transmitting a signal because it found that particular channel was occupied
5494451 there would be zero chance of causing any interference to the signals because in that situation there certainly would not be a transmission of the signal in the first place

5494487 we need to focus a lot more than we have before on the education opportunities for immigrant children this makes very clear that theyre a big part of our future
5494488 i wondered why that was true and found that those second generation hispanic mothers did have higher education attainment than the third generation

5494490 youre ignoring japan youre ignoring korea the statement that somehow the web has not been mobile until the iphone is absurd and back to the point about parochialism

5494492 everyone is looking for a more of an iphone blackberry like solution
5494493 you can trick yourself into believing the iphone is not such a big deal if you say there are only 7 million in the world

5494497 how can the space coast trust john mccain when he has failed us so many other times in the senate chairman mccain was the one man that could have stood up to prevent the space flight gap and save thousands of space coast jobs however as is the case with so many other issues mccain instead stood with president bush and to add insult to injury mccain fought against nasa funding calling it pork barrel spending
5494498 while residents of the space coast were looking for an open dialogue about space policy john mccain opted instead for a closed door meeting with hand picked people unfortunately it is not surprising that mccain would take yet another page from the bush rove playbook since he is afraid to defend his failed record on nasa issues
5494499 statements on space are a confusing and contradictory muddle ranging from freezing nasa spending to extending the shuttle program
5494500 mr chairman space flight you cant do it on the cheap and i just dont think that a billion dollar increase over five years thats 200 million a year is going to do it and i would love for you to explain on the reprogramming of the 11 billion over that five years how you can do that i think my other concern is i would not like to see repeated the period of time between 1975 and 1981 when we were down and not flying with humans when apollo soyuz last flew and the space shuttle was supposed to fly three years later it wasnt until 81 a total of six years that we were down and my concern in what youve outlined and what the president outlined in the speech over at nasa headquarters is that you phase out the space shuttle by 2010 and then if we dont fly this new vehicle until four five six years later that means that our only human access to space is that we have to rely on russian rockets and european rockets and i dont think thats good for the country and so rather than having a hiatus i would love to have you comment as to how we might have an overlap where we would keep the space shuttle flying until such time as the other vehicle is already tested and ready to fly
5494501 the second point i would ask about is the concern about the start stop stop start and the continuity of the work force we now as you know quite well in michoud in new orleans have this huge facility with thousands of employees and my real concern as i look at the presidents plan that well probably have as much as a five year gap after the shuttle has completed its work and the time that we start with this new cev vehicle that is now only in the very minute planning stages what do we do to keep the continuity of the work force im really concerned these folks if they lose the work theyre gone you have to restart re stop how do we address that continuity of service that is so necessary to get what you need to accomplish
5494502 it is a critical factor that we really need to work the details of that have got a few years out thats not to say were not going to start right now trying to sort through what those consequences are at least the next four years youre looking at production of the external tank et cetera that are necessary to fly shuttle there are a number of different options that will look at shuttle derived approaches for lift capability for the project constellation exploration vehicle thats not yet determined and were looking for creative ideas from the industry to do that im not convinced theres going to be a gap or a hiatus there because again part of what is in the dialogue with senator nelson a little bit earlier what were pursuing is an acquisition strategy of a spiral development of which the first spiral of the project constellation exploration vehicle unmanned will be launched as early as 08 and a little bit later this decade
5494503 specifically the senate voted to add 1 billion on top of the 10 billion the bill already provided to nasa i continue to support nasa and space research but at what cost to our nations children who will inherit the largest national debt this country has seen again i would like to express my disappointment that senate leadership has brought to the floor a bill that is 3 billion over the presidents request containing more than 600 earmarks in my recent travels around the nation i hear again and again from citizens who are fed up with porkbarrel spending and yet congress fails to listen it is a shame and i can only hope that the american people will join me and the president in expressing their displeasure with this bill i hope that the remaining six appropriations bills do not contain such rampant and reckless spending and that congress works to regain some fiscal discipline
5494504 mccain spoke at carnegie mellon university here this morning and laid out his plan for the future of the economy
5494505 means it would take longer and cost more to get the moon program rolling providing the freeze didnt lead to the project getting whacked which it could
5494506 the only power of government that could stop them was the power of veto and it was rarely used if that authority is entrusted to me i will use the veto as needed and as the founders intended i will veto every bill with earmarks until the congress stops sending bills with earmarks i will seek a constitutionally valid line item veto to end the practice once and for all
5494507 obama trumped john mccain on space saying he supports closing the five year gap between the shuttle programs end in 2010 and the start of the nasas constellation project in 2015 and with it new spacecraft to take astronauts back to the moon

5494511 orton won the competition without directing the offense to a touchdown or completing a pass of more than 17 yards his five preseason possessions resulted in two field goals and three punts
5494512 to come to a decision like that weve taken a lot of things into consideration last year how we finished the season otas training camp preseason games
5494513 in the end it comes down to a gut feeling that you have and i feel good about kyle leading our team
5494514 felt what she did was the best for her district
5494515 californians have been waiting for us to pass a budget now for over a month in a half
5494516 its outrageous that any member democrat or republican of this legislature would force the children and the elderly and the disabled people of california to continue to suffer without a budget because of the narrow interests of their own district
5494517 i think its in the zeitgeist theres a trend towards apocalyptic images in popular culture at the moment the world is a pretty anxiety ridden place although at the time of writing the story it felt like it was very much embedded in the south african situation specifically
5494518 a weird attraction part of me is drawn to the idea of everything being wiped away and starting again anew
5494519 its interesting for me that a lot of those classic science fiction scenarios seem to have been discovered anew by mainstream literary authors

5494522 the war set the stage for a more comprehensive middle east conflict
5494523 it set into motion a dynamic in the arab world where much of the arab street believes that hezbollah won that war and there is tremendous expectation on hezbollah to continue the struggle
5494524 we destroyed all of hezbollahs infrastructure much of its civilian headquarters we killed about a quarter of their fighters that is a prohibitive number of casualties for any modern fighting force and yet perception is everything in the middle east and the perception was in the arab world at least that israel was bested in that conflict
5494525 israel would then have to reply into lebanon possibly drawing in the syrians and ultimately the iranians

5494576 we argue that humans possess an innate system for enumeration that doesnt rely on words
5494577 basic number and arithmetic skills are built on a specialized innate system
5494578 our findings are consistent with the idea that we have an innate system for representing quantity ideas and that the lack of number words in a language should not prevent us from completing simple number and computation tasks
5494579 perhaps the most striking result comes from the cross modal matching task where the child has to put out the number of counters corresponding to a sequence of auditory events
5494580 this cannot be done using but requires the child to generate a mental representation that is abstract enough to serve to represent both auditory and visual enumeration
5494581 in order to demonstrate their desired conclusion the authors would need to evaluate an age group across languages with and without number words where the participants in the language with number words can succeed in getting close to 100 percent accuracy on the tasks then the effects of the absence of number words can be evaluated in the population speaking the language that lacks number words

5494587 producing this interview as a convergence media program allowing our viewers to explore the information in context really helps close the knowledge gap between experts like austin bay and general petraeus and our viewers who on average spend just over an hour and a half engaged in this thirty minute conversation
5494588 for me this is protecting and fighting for my district the future of central valley and i knew that there would be a price to be paid
5494589 i have been a moderate democrat i have voted with republicans and with democrats and every two years i have asked people in my district to vote for me and i ask republicans independents and decline to states to vote for me and so to be pigeon holed to only support democrats is frustrating
5494590 there are two things you do when youre in the majority party in this assembly one is vote on your leader and two is vote on the budget because the budget has been negotiated amongst democrats and represents the majoritys negotiated budget
5494591 and three we have spent millions of dollars ensuring that nicole comes back three times in a row to the assembly and to our caucus
5494592 despite his campaigns outreach efforts mccains attempt to bridge the gender gap has fallen flat
5494593 barack obama is spinning this issue to disguise his support for higher taxes and refusing to acknowledge that the legislation hes promoting has more to do with paychecks for trial lawyers than the struggles of working women
5494594 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
5494595 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
5494596 the modern art fair for us normal folks some pieces for as low as 9 99 with nothing in the house going for more than five bills become a collector
5494597 we feel we owe you all a small heads up and our apologies for lack of updates
5494598 were still here and working hard on getting alan wake for you to enjoy
5494599 i particularly hope he strengthens his economic message even senator obama can speak more clearly and specifically about the kitchen table bread and butter issues like high energy costs
5494600 its fine to tell people about hope and change but you have to have plenty of concrete pragmatic ideas that bring hope and change to life
5494601 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
5494602 democrats should take a deep breath and realize that there are a group of voters who wont make up their mind about a candidate until deep in the fall
5494603 and there are 18 states that are battlegrounds for a reason and theyll be decided by 2 to 4 points i dont care about national polls
5494604 the one area he still needs credibility in is experience and picking an evan bayh or a joe biden as vice president would help a lot with that
5494605 it wouldnt be bad if he came out early and said who his secretary of defense and secretary of state would be that would address and stabilize the concerns about his experience

5494610 underground filmmaker music video director and photographer kern action has built the latter half of his career on documenting a kind of hipster porn aesthetic and this latest book his tenth continues that trend with glossy full color images of women caught seemingly unawares in various stages of undress at their best the pictures here are simple and effective as much about the play of light atmosphere and composition as about any forced notions of sexuality at their worst they are simply cheesy one an obvious homage to the iconic 70s image of a female tennis payer scratching her butt comes off as less sexy than clumsy and stale as might be expected in a book that purports to be created on the fly theres an abundance of public nudity and crotch shots here perhaps one of kerns particular fetishes and most of the images are in soft focus as if taken with telephoto lens from behind bushes and across fields kern prefers his models natural and disheveled readers might welcome the lack of make up and artifice in his photographs assuming that the essential artifice of reconstructed voyeurism doesnt turn them off that is
5494611 we sent him to washington for the really big show
5494612 get me the details so i can alert cornyn and let him know what we are doing to help him
5494613 i strongly suggest we start doing patch throughs to perry and cornyn
5494614 let the honor of your student be as dear to you as your own
5494615 ive seen people jumping out of the windows and people breaking windows with golf clubs
5494616 i knew the people who used to live in that house they just left and no one has come since
5494617 i would like to see people living in there someone that is nice not feral
5494618 i think it is absolutely disgusting that there are people out there that do need housing and kids are just destroying the place
5494619 they the vandals would be aged from 12 to 16 i would reckon they mainly come of an afternoon
5494620 im looking for a place to live at the moment so thats why i think it is disgusting
5494621 housing nsw is aware that all properties that are vacant even for short periods of time are at greater risk of vandalism
5494622 housing nsw has spent 1000 repairing the home after the recent vandalism reportedly by children this will have no effect on getting the house on the market as soon as possible
5494623 both i and my 11 work colleagues from macquarie generation enjoyed an extremely positive experience
5494624 we were hoping to get a few people to sign a petition opposing the sell off of our power industry
5494625 we were absolutely overwhelmed by the staggering response we received by the maitland community which has given our morale a much needed boost we collected more than 900 signatures at our little table with many people volunteering to sign without being asked
5494626 we are hoping to present 100 000 signatures to mr iemma
5494627 i reckon we could get this number from maitland alone
5494628 our chiller units have been installed and that was the last of the system that had to go in
5494629 the last thing were waiting on now is an electricity upgrade
5494630 hes more than welcome to come back to feel his governments investment and keep his cool
5494631 it might be a good opportunity for him to get out of the hot box in sydney
5494632 the present system is not working and we must make it work
5494633 to do this we must get the message out to people maitland is a no go place if you want to muck around
5494634 we do know that assaults certainly decreased in newcastle when a lockout was introduced there
5494635 i have support from maitland city council for a voluntary midnight lockout because of the anti social behaviour other people have to put up with over weekends
5494636 we have seen what happened in newcastle and now it is happening here
5494637 it is also the coldest time of the year it will get worse in warmer weather
5494638 a lockout will mean anyone found wandering the streets after midnight should be on their way home or they are up to no good
5494639 we will continue to liaise with hotels and work out with them a strategy that is best suited to maitland
5494640 but police and licensees can only do so much and it really comes down to people acting in a responsible manner
5494641 if you lock people out at midnight what time do you kick them out
5494642 a lockout may stop people venue changing but do you shut all venues at once sending everyone out on to the streets at the same time
5494643 during construction of the flyover the traffic is limited to 60kph through this area
5494644 when the roadworks are completed i am advised the rta intends to close the right hand turn from the avalon estate into the rest of thornton effectively landlocking the estate
5494645 once the traffic speed limit is increased back up to 90kph when the road works are completed we will have even more problems getting out of the estate in cars but more importantly getting our children safely to the bus stop
5494646 i have suggested at the very least a pedestrian traffic light or overpass be built across the highway this would enable people to walk their children across the highway in order to catch buses to school
5494647 the interruptions to traffic would be minimal as on many days the traffic is banked up to the maitland tafe campus already during the peak time so a designated pedestrian crossing during peak times would not create any additional traffic
5494648 a pedestrian crossing will perhaps cost motorists a couple of minutes
5494649 however what is the alternative how many children will have to be killed to justify a little more time for motorists to get to work in the morning
5494650 first and foremost the rta will be looking at the intersection the residents fear that when the weakleys drive overpass is finished theres going to be traffic coming through at higher speeds
5494651 the rta will determine whether that intersection is adequate or whether it needs upgrading
5494652 my personal view is that we should seriously consider opening the mall but its got to be for the right reasons not a token gesture
5494653 the issue of opening the mall is complex and needs to be looked at in conjunction with a range of other issues
5494654 but the mall is not withering and dying we have a range of new stores and eateries that have been building for a few years now
5494655 the cbd central business district presents a unique opportunity to tie together the cultural and community centre of the city we have the art gallery the town hall the council chambers and three major government departments that employ a significant portion of our workforce
5494656 the nsw rental market is already under immense pressure however the added impact of people defaulting on mortgages and moving from homeowner to renter will only inflame an already critical situation
5494657 the downward trend of these figures is set to continue if the state government insists on sticking its head in the sand on the issue of rental vacancies
5494658 the nsw governments staunch refusal to acknowledge this growing crisis is going to lead to thousands of people suffering housing stress
5494659 unless matters such as land tax and stamp duty are addressed immediately the consequences could be dire
5494660 it is envisaged that customers will ultimately benefit from cost effective and innovative internet telephony service
5494661 a rational nature that was assumed to be elevated above and distinct from that of mere animals
5494662 to picture the world and its phenomena objectively and mechanistically without reference to human subjectivity and meaning
5494663 what seemed increasingly to be a soulless and materialistic age dominated by large machines and larger social and economic mechanisms
5494664 reminding us that the ancients knew things about humankind that modernity has failed to repeal even if it has managed to forget them
5494665 bangsa bangsa yang saling ketakutan intai mengintai seperti hewan buas di malam hari

5494669 it is the second biggest economy in the world and in 50 years it will be the biggest
5494670 starting with diefenbaker trudeau and all of us we established very good relations relatively speaking with china
5494671 and suddenly you break the bridge it would have been easy just to be there
5494672 he had to swallow himself whole and he went there the chinese are like that ok fine you dont like us were not buying french food
5494673 as a canadian i deplore the fact weve lost our position in the world
5494674 ask any businessman who goes to china and theyll tell you that
5494675 we do business with saudi arabia and theyre not a big democracy
5494676 at the end of the day i would say the only way the consumer jumps in is if its subsidized
5494677 wed have to see a price point of somewhere around 200 to really show that theyre rim going after the apple market the iphone market or at least be more in the same ballpark
5494678 ouch and here i was still hoping that it would come in at 299 like the 16 gig iphone 3g silly me
5494679 it really comes down to what you need more in a phone while the bold certainly has improved media and other consumer features it really is a business device at the end of the day
5494680 the iphone 3g is a consumer device that happens to play nice with a lot of corporations and we honestly think you wont find many people dropping their blackberrys for an iphone theyll carry both as long as they can afford it
5494681 so some enterprise user who is very internet centric would certainly want to take advantage of the bold on the other hand somebody who may use it more for email applications for the most part the appeal isnt there
5494682 we believe investors should see rims growth outperforming peers in 08
5494683 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5494684 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5494685 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5494686 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5494687 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5494688 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5494689 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5494690 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5494691 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5494692 im moving different places so i go to different schools
5494693 now we have just a little space my mom says that when we move to our own place ill have more room
5494694 theres a lot of red tape a lot of sitting around you got to take your whole family to the appointments
5494695 the kids they watch out for each other but they get stressed out

5494708 i had gone out of town for a couple of days and am unaware whether haywood has left the country i spoke to him last on friday august 15 he never indicated or mentioned that he had intentions to leave the country i personally feel that he must have gone away to get a break and relax from the trauma he has gone through in the past couple of weeks
5494709 we could not impound his passport since his involvement in the ahmedabad blasts was not confirmed
5494710 we plan to sell minority stake at spv special purpose vehicle levels in our projects in bangalore pune and gurgaon with us being the majority shareholder in all the projects we expect this to happen in 2008 after our rights issue
5494711 we are not looking to sell stake with any assured return on their investment as it will be more of a structured debt
5494712 we will decide about the pricing in our extraordinary general meeting in the third or fourth week of september and that will soon be followed by the offering
5494713 i will turn in my resignation to the national assembly speaker today and leave the presidency
5494714 i hope the nation and the people of pakistan will forgive my mistakes as i believe that whatever i have done in the past was in good faith for the betterment of the people and for the country
5494715 she took a hammer and hit down over and over
5494716 i jumped in and was holding her and she was pinching me and scratching me

5494731 this parliament is unprecedented in terms of the amount of time we have had minority government so maybe people are starting to think its run its course
5494732 he needs a pretty good justification to force an election because he is the guy who wants to hold regular elections
5494733 this is kind of giving him a bit of justification to even start thinking about it
5494734 the tories are competitive where they need to be competitive the liberals are competitive where they need to be competitive if they do decide to throw down the gauntlet its going to be a very interesting fight
5494735 we cannot really love anybody with whom we never laugh
5494736 the most wasted of all days is the one without laughter
5494737 if you dont learn to laugh at trouble you wont have anything to laugh at when youre old
5494738 you grow up the day you have your first real laugh at yourself
5494739 you can turn painful situations around through laughter if you can humor in anything even poverty you can survive it
5494740 in no case do we anticipate that the office will close before june of 2009

5494744 i was jk though when i told you that maura and liz were part of birthday boy theyre not boys and theyre certainly not filmmakers so they wouldnt be part of such an upstanding group of young men
5494745 i went to school with some of those guys dan morgan racki and will went to high school together in massachusetts craig is also from massachusetts though he met dan in college blah blah blah
5494746 those boys moved to los angeles and decided to continue the film collective they established back on the east coast theyve done some pretty great things including this short film called the bicycle thief

5494775 we hebben alles geprobeerd in andere kwesties is aan bedrijven wel eens verlenging gegeven we hebben gesmeekt en alles gedaan maar het was nee
5494776 we blijven overtuigd dat onze strategie de juiste is inclusief de snelle integratie van abn amro
5494777 we willen het vertrouwen van aandeelhouders herstellen een belangrijke stap zetten in het verbeteren van de communicatie
5494778 deze informatieve bijeenkomst was beter dan verwacht maar we zijn er nog niet de bestuurders draaien om de echt lastige vragen heen we willen de verantwoordingsvraag stellen
5494779 het beeld bestaat dat ik aan de touwtjes trek dat is niet zo er is geen enkele ja knikker in ons bestuur het zijn allemaal onafhankelijke geesten ik leg niets op ik ben een facilitator niet een initiator

5494782 its not ethanol thats driving up the cost of food
5494783 transportation costs related to high energy costs high oil costs are doing it now
5494784 it has contributed to food price increases theres no doubt about that the question is how much
5494785 creel acudir como presidente del senado para expresar la disposici n de todas las bancadas de actuar responsablemente en la reforma de leyes secundarias relacionadas con el tema
5494786 preocupa much simo el robo de autos porque pensamos que puede haber una especie de migraci n de los que salen del segmento del narcotr fico y se pueden estar dedicando a otras actividades menores como esta a otro tipo de actividad criminal
5494787 nos preocupa nos preocupa mucho y es muy probable que en los estados donde la frecuencia de robo est aumentando la tarifas o cuotas correspondientes a robos si tengan que tener un incremento
5494788 no ha sido posible llegar a un acuerdo con ellos cemex y el pr ximo paso que deberemos seguir es proceder a la expropiaci n

5494791 no vemos ning n conflicto por lo que hace con el sindicato petrolero o el sindicato con la empresa petr leos mexicanos mucho menos
5494792 ellos han interpuesto una demanda de amparo ante el poder judicial de la federaci n y nosotros hemos presentado nuestro informe justificado y la audiencia constitucional ha pasado para el 8 de septiembre de este a o

5494800 commodore bainimarama had the opportunity through his attendance at the forum to explain this decision in person to pacific leaders
5494801 fiji will still be despite his absence a major feature of leaders discussions in niue
5494802 my assessment is that leaders feel that the events in fiji are really casting a stain on the
5494803 the leaders want to be seen and have the forum be seen to continue to be leading international opinion and action on the issue
5494804 the pacific forum needs to understand that we in fiji will decide what is in our national interest in the short and the long term
5494805 we continue to see significant differences between specific segments within the overall memphis market
5494806 while sales remain at lower levels the declines have moderated and we anticipate the recently enacted 7 500 tax credit will help entice hesitant first time buyers to the market where prices and mortgage rates remain attractive
5494807 public comments serve a broader purpose than just trying to alter the administrations opinion
5494808 this parliament is unprecedented in terms of the amount of time we have had minority government so maybe people are starting to think its run its course
5494809 he needs a pretty good justification to force an election because he is the guy who wants to hold regular elections

5494816 and i hate to say that people are lying but heres a situation where folks are lying
5494817 even if it was as a consequence of an induced abortion
5494818 so for people to suggest that i and the illinois medical society so illinois doctors were somehow in favor of withholding life saving support from an infant born alive is ridiculous it defies commonsense and it defies imagination and for people to keep on pushing this is offensive
5494819 was not the bill that was presented at the state level
5494820 the act of killing a just born child was considered so heinous that the federal bill the born alive infant protection act was supported by pro abortion senator barbara boxer d calif and unopposed by naral the national abortion and reproductive rights action league
5494821 senator obamas position in the illinois senate was to oppose any legislation that would protect such innocent life everyone else was clear that the bill addressed infanticide not abortion

5494845 russia is a state that is unfortunately using the one tool that it has always used when it wishes to deliver a message that is its military power
5494846 i think the french will undoubtedly be seeking from the russians an explanation for why the russian president either wont or cant keep his word
5494847 were reinforcing the point that they are safely within the transatlantic structures
5494848 thats just to remind people that russia is a far cry in terms of its geostrategic center from where the soviet union was
5494849 i think everybody recognizes that this is not the first time that weve seen this problem
5494850 weve had russian strategic aviation challenging even along borders with the united states which i might note is a very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
5494851 the hope had been that russia was going to build its foundation and relationships with europe and the united states on the basis of russian economic political cultural and other kinds of assets

5494873 youre going to see more and more search engines become part of other applications so we think that this application will be particularly well suited for when youre looking for people or companies or entities of any nature
5494874 the reason why people wanted to develop semantic web search engines is because its a more real way of finding stuff
5494875 keeping in mind that the content is growing faster search engines need to be more effective at reflecting the thinking of real people
5494876 some people think that the behaviour of how people express their information needs has been established by google so even though they dont express it in natural language they do use just a couple of words

5494917 it was a very happy home with very little pain to deal with
5494918 it kind of gave me an unrealistic view of everything
5494919 ive looked back at some of these songs recently and thought to myself are you serious
5494920 i just love how true and raw their lyrics are
5494921 i get one line into one of their songs and i have to stop and write my own
5494922 their lyrics are that much more powerful because of the way they sing them
5494923 most nights id end up with an unfinished song but when the day would come when all the pieces would align and id know this is a song for people to hear there is no better release in the world those are some of the only times that i can go out at night or sit on the couch next to my loved ones and feel at peace like job well done i can rest at least for a second
5494924 i dont prefer being sad but its a real spot for me if you met me im not this dark sulking person though im not bubbly by any means either i guess it comes down to the fact that im not afraid of being sad

5494951 we are not afraid of anybody on the field but we are afraid of ourselves we are sometimes scared to make mistakes
5494952 i was speaking to a couple of players yesterday theres a lot of uncertainty and there always seems to be these big decisions to be made
5494953 it is an important time for cricket everyone has identified that players and administrators
5494954 but as was the case throughout my career you just take the advice of the experts in the security field and thats what ca and the players association are continuing to do and the players would trust that opinion i have no doubt about that
5494955 the important issue now is for us to work with the icc we are not in the business of going to players and asking their answers prior to us making a decision
5494956 i work very closely with paul marsh the australian cricketers association chief executive and individual players from time to time but we are not deliberately interfering with the players preparation at the moment until we have got something to tell them
5494957 our view is quite simply we need now to see where the icc choose to go with this im sure they will come back to us in the next few days as always we are working with all of our parties and that decision will play itself out in due course
5494958 the icc are the ones who are in control of both the detail and the possible alternative venue so im sure we all understand that its their position now
5494959 you know everybody has a personal story and everyone deals with it in different ways
5494960 the lessons learned through life are there and for good and bad you have to take them as they are and move forward
5494961 ive found triathlon is a passion and something ive wanted to put my heart and soul and every bit of energy into today is one of those days
5494962 then triathlon caught my eye and i got involved through swimming
5494963 i picked up each leg and enjoyed the cross training and the variety
5494964 being there experiencing the atmosphere i thought this is something i might want to aspire to instead of swimming
5494965 i dont have any regrets about not going to athens

5494969 he wasnt here at the sale yesterday but a few people who did speak to him said he was happy
5494970 i think he was happy just to reduce some of his stock and its always the best time of year to do it
5494971 when youve got the quality of stock he has i suppose it the amount of money was almost expected

5495002 this multi billion pound windfall for the energy firms has to be used to protect the most vulnerable people from the effects of fuel poverty
5495003 niebuhrs view was that rationality belongs to the cool observer but because of the stupidity of the average man he follows not reason but faith and this naive faith requires necessary illusion and emotionally potent oversimplifications which are provided by the myth maker to keep the ordinary person on course its not the case as the naive might think that indoctrination is inconsistent with democracy rather as this whole line of thinkers observes it is the essence of democracy

5495061 the recent conflict will have dramatic repercussions for russia and the international community as a whole for quite some time to come
5495062 it is the biggest geopolitical turning point since the 1991 soviet collapse it is a new stage in international relations the end of any illusion about the peaceful nature of development in east west relations
5495063 whatever happens now in the caucasus relations between russia and the west and russias west leaning neighbours must surely from this moment on be re evaluated by all
5495064 russias reaction was a predetermined policy in search of an appropriate application
5495065 the situation in south ossetia proved a perfect storm for moscow
5495066 russia had said for many years that it was ready to use force outside its borders
5495067 but the fact of actually doing it changes the strategic situation
5495068 at the critical moment it appeared the united states could not actually do anything
5495069 it is a signal that those who decide to bank exclusively on the united states might want to think about this
5495070 a new world order if i can say it should emerge
5495071 frankly speaking the western alliance does not have strong leverage to counter
5495072 i dont see that russia is winning the psychological information war but from a point of view of political and economic achievements i believe russia has the stronger hand now
5495073 were mad as hell and we wont take it anymore

5495097 senior u s officials had expressed concerned over the weekend about the new reported test saying iran could use the rocket to deliver warheads
5495098 the iranian development and testing of rockets is troubling and raises further questions about their intentions
5495099 never has any media outlet called me to check the athletes ages
5495100 we are a sports department how would we have the ability to do that
5495101 we already explained this very clearly theres no need to discuss this thing again
5495102 the fig international gymnastics federation and ioc international olympic committee are the proper bodies to handle this
5495103 when you talk about a 15 team league you have to wonder what a schedule would look like
5495104 our challenge is to put together 14 team schedule like we used last year and see what a 15 team schedule would look like

5495112 spectrum is very valuable and we want to make sure its being used as efficiently as possible
5495113 the idea of trying to utilize the white spaces from a consumer perspective would be a good win for everyone
5495114 when you look at low power fm or ultrawide band rules the technology has great promise but the commission adopted rules that constrained it to the detriment of consumers
5495115 so of course there are concerns that that the rules could be too limiting
5495116 since this is a beta release applications developed with it may not quite be compatible with devices running the final android 1 0
5495117 will give developers a chance to build polished applications once hardware is available
5495118 due to significant api changes in the upstream open source project and due to the timeline of getting certain bluetooth profile implementations certified a comprehensive bluetooth api will not be possible or present in android 1 0
5495119 due to the security risks inherent in accepting arbitrary data from outside the device the data messaging facility of the gtalkservice will not be present in android 1 0
5495120 we know that these changes will affect many developers who have worked with the prior early looks at the sdk and we are very sorry for the resulting inconvenience
5495121 we look forward to the possibility of restoring some or all of this functionality in a later version of the android platform

5495125 all of these are explored in depth on deepcapture com where 75 000 in prizes await those who help expose this
5495126 it is a sign of the hack reporters that they try to spin this issue which is about a serious as a heart attack problem in our capital markets as overstock

5495128 my name is lavan rai i am a member of svs when i read your story i felt pain and happiness at the same time you have achieved your independence after a great struggle like you cultivate coffee there we cultivate tea here we grow other things however tea is our primary produce which sustains us economically i believe and hope that someday some year we will meet
5495129 like you all we too battled against the government for many years for our rights and many of our brothers gave their lives
5495130 july 3 2008 dear friend a lot of remembrance to all the friends of guaemala i am very happy to know about your place and your organization it seems your primary produce is coffee and bananas similarly our primary produce is tea leaves besides that we also cultivate ginger tumeric caridum oranges and round chilies we sell these produce in our local markets only tea is being sold in the international market in this way dlr prerna darjeeling ladenla road prerna and tpi tea promoters india have contributed a great deal in selling the tea in the international market they have contributed a lot of their time and efforts to our organization secondly fair trade has also helped a lot to our organization it has provided a great encouragement to the people here to work with more dedication and zeal a lot of work has been done by the money that came from fair trade for example the weighing shed for green tea leaves repair of roads svs office providing a computer building small bridges community hall etc all this work became possible by selling our green tea therefore we will continue this cultivation in the future with all sincerity i hope that we will continue to communicate with each other through letters and know about our organizations your friend binita rai
5495131 my regards to all the residents of guatemala i was very saddened to read about the painful experiences you have been through but now better days seem to have come the fruit of labor is sweet we too are struggling against a lot of problems here but our problems are nothing compared to what you have been through we humans are never satisfied how long does it take for the plant in the given picture to bear fruit do coffee plants also get attacked by pests how much does one plant yield in kilograms to drink coffee at home is it hand prepared or do you buy a coffee powder i have several questions like these all of which cannot be put down here therefore i will consider myself fortunate if i can continue writing to you i bid farewell by wishing you the very best thanks lhendup lepcha svs aabotay darjeeling
5495132 july 6 2008 dear sister even at this tender age you work so hard when i saw you working in the picture i felt like meeting you and sharing our joys and sorrows unfortunately we cannot meet but i am like your elder brother therefore i pray to god for your better future and best wishes to you and your future brother puran tamang

5495146 the gap in revenue per employee between google and sap and salesforce com for instance indicates that google would more likely be more interested in what ebay does or in monetizing youtube than in zoho or salesforce coms barely profitable business companies invest in what generates the best return on investment
5495147 googles margins are a once in a lifetime occurrence and google will move in that high growth direction thats why microsoft is so desperate about search it has a higher growth rate we are more worried about microsoft than google microsoft will address the internet but pulling down office margins is a challenge for them no company peacefully accepts a lowering of margins
5495148 our intention is to help erode microsofts profit margin coming in from below
5495149 if salesforce is a proxy it would be difficult for google to justify the investment more costs are associated with support than in r amp d even with on demand software the moment you have paying customers the expectations are different and google is finding that out with recent gmail problems
5495150 one of the privileges we enjoy as a private company is to not disclose revenue profit numbers which lets us do the kind of analysis on competitors they cant do on us
5495151 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5495152 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5495153 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5495154 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority
5495155 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies

5495159 faced with the embarrassing prospect of holding a fundraiser with one of jack abramoffs closest associates the mccain campaign scrambled today to scratch ralph reed from tonights program but voters deserve to know the answers to the real questions raised by reeds involvement
5495160 will senator mccain keep the money reed has raised for him and is reed is a member of the mccain victory 2008 team if the mccain campaign wont return the money reed has raised for them then voters should rightly ask why it matters that reed didnt show up at tonights event the real question isnt why reed isnt showing up but why a so called reformer would invite him at all

5495182 the california hispanic chambers of commerce is pleased to partner with nhbic to add this new service to help our members build their businesses through technology
5495183 the business resources on nhbics web site levels the playing field by giving hispanic firms access to online information not available before because of cost or language differences
5495184 the number of hispanic owned businesses in the u s is estimated at 2 8 million in 2007 and expected to reach 4 3 million by 2012
5495185 but 88 are small businesses where the owner is self employed with no paid employees if they have access to the business information they need including resources in spanish it increases their chances of growing and succeeding
5495186 all of nhbics components are geared toward building a more vibrant business community within the u s hispanic population which now totals 45 5 million people
5495187 our partnership not only promotes the growth and success of hispanic business in california it also strengthens the contributions hispanics entrepreneurs make to our countrys economy

5495209 he got a higher level of information than any other player has gotten he was really pleasantly surprised
5495210 we thought the meeting went well and marian expressed the same thing
5495211 i have a lot of respect for how they handled that
5495212 i dont control what they do i just represent marian
5495213 he really has no decisions to make the experience playing for the minnesota wild has been great we have no bones to pick about anything i really feel that marian has been treated well and has enjoyed his career there to date
5495214 leading 32 nm high k metal gate technology that no other company or consortium can match
5495215 sometimes you can be pleasantly surprised when something quite unsuitable looking turns out to be very comfortable i was not surprised it was indeed quite uncomfortable
5495216 well see if they can turn their attention to governance and get a handle on their problems
5495217 they have been using the musharraf thing as an excuse for non governance
5495218 this is really the moment of truth for pakistan if this fails it is unclear what will happen
5495219 it will take the new government a full year to work things out on counterterrorism a year to make the mistakes they have to make it is a huge experiment
5495220 the resignation of president pervez musharraf is a step toward moving pakistan onto a more stable political footing
5495221 pakistan is a critical theater in countering the threat of al qaeda and violent islamic extremism and i look forward to the government increasing its future cooperation
5495222 were confident that we will maintain a good relationship with the government of pakistan
5495223 had a good meeting with the prime minister a couple of weeks ago in washington the pakistanis realize that the threat of terrorism the threat of extremism is a threat to them as well as the rest of the world
5495224 he hasnt effectively been leading pakistan for the last six months
5495225 youre truly not going to see any great changes in pakistan with musharrafs resignation with the exception you will start to see greater political infighting among the coalition partners
5495226 you could count on him to make tough decisions even though you could never count on him to completely follow through
5495227 it will probably be much harder to get decisive action as we did with musharraf the good news is that the democracy process is moving forward and it may be possible to create a more durable political framework
5495228 anything such as that or any other military equipment that was moved in would be in violation of this cease fire and should be removed immediately
5495229 the only forces that are permitted to remain under the cease fire agreement are the forces that were in there in the august fifth timeframe
5495230 there continues to be a shortage of bedding food hygiene kits kitchen sets tents
5495231 and so there is a real need and were trying to fill that need and alleviate the suffering the defense department as the lead for humanitarian operations is looking at other options for sustaining the humanitarian relief operation
5495232 the united states is committed to helping georgia rebuild not only its infrastructure but also help them rebuild their security forces as well

5495241 sometimes its difficult to know what a politician will actually do once in office because they say different things at different times to different people
5495242 this is a particular problem when a candidate has a short thin record on the issues as is the case of sen obama

5495367 you know long waits for health care and some services not even available
5495368 whoever the next president is health care should be at the top of his agenda bring everyone to the table and make it happen
5495369 absolutely shes credible and the reason i feel shes very credible is because people within the fbi have corroborated a lot of her story
5495370 the problems i have reported have serious consequences to our national security and have already been confirmed by the inspector generals report and the inquiry of senators grassley and leahy translation units are the frontline in gathering translating and disseminating intelligence a warning in advance of the next terrorist attack may and probably will come in the form of a message or document in a foreign language that will have to be translated if an attack then occurs which could have been prevented by acting on information in such a message who will tell family members of the new terrorist attack victims that nothing more could have been done there will be no excuse that we did not know because we do know
5495371 its ludicrous to classify information thats been in the public domain for two years ive got questions about whether this has anything to do with genuine national security if it does then the action might actually aid our enemies by alerting them to publicly available information that the u s government now considers sensitive it doesnt enhance national security for the justice department and the fbi to go out of its way to identify and classify information thats on line in newspapers and on the airwaves
5495372 the majority of the allegations raised by edmonds related to the actions of a co worker the allegations raised serious concerns that if true could potentially have extremely damaging consequences for the fbi these allegations warranted a thorough and careful review by the fbi our investigation concluded that the fbi did not and still has not adequately investigated these allegations our review also found that many although not all of edmonds allegations about the co worker had some basis in fact this evidence does not prove and we are not suggesting that there is sufficient evidence to conclude that espionage or any improper disclosures of fbi information occurred however we believe the fbi should have taken edmonds allegations more seriously and investigated them more thoroughly as discussed in this report the fbis investigation of the information regarding the co worker was significantly flawed had the fbi investigated the claims thoroughly it would have found that many of edmonds allegations regarding the co worker were supported by documentary evidence or other witnesses instead the fbi seems to have discounted edmonds allegations believing she was a disruptive influence and not credible and eventually terminated her services even now the fbi has not carefully investigated the allegations about the co worker to determine if the co worker compromised any fbi information in light of the need for fbi vigilance about security issues as demonstrated by the hanssen case we believe the fbi should have investigated these serious allegations more thoroughly
5495373 this report confirms that the fbi failed to treat this case as seriously as the situation demanded it is unacceptable and it deeply concerns us that in the wake of the robert hanssen spy case and in the months following september 11th the fbi failed to vigorously investigate these grave allegations this report does not determine whether the underlying claims would have ultimately been proven accurate but the fbis flawed response gives me little confidence that the bureau or its leaders have learned from decades of repeated mistakes
5495374 time and again we hear from the fbi that whistleblowers who raise legitimate complaints will not be retaliated against its time for more than just lip service the inspector generals report did not address the truthfulness of the allegations but the ig did determine that if the fbi had actually looked into the allegations they might have found that where theres smoke theres fire once again the fbi has shown that it has a long way to go in its treatment of whistleblowers
5495375 a review of the fbis actions in connection with allegations raised by contract linguist sibel edmonds
5495376 two government whistleblowers on monday called on federal workers to come forward if they have information that could help investigations of the sept 11 terrorist attacks the request was made by sibel edmonds a former fbi translator who alleges that the government knew more details about the 9 11 plot than it has admitted and daniel ellsberg a former marine who leaked the pentagon papers about the vietnam war to the media in 1971
5495377 we dont want to be in a situation where we are in some kind of frozen relationship
5495378 but until russia pulls its forces out of georgia and respects international norms of the 21st century we just cant go on with business as usual
5495379 if these decisions are in fact taken on behalf of the georgian aggressor we will not be able to maintain the quality and the schedule of our relationship with nato
5495380 we have a serious temptation to bring all our potential cooperation with nato under question
5495381 hes going to make a decision and we want him to make that decision with all the information thats out there and not base it on any misconceptions or myths

5495425 a thorough and definitive investigation by the commission would have addressed all of sibel edmonds concerns and spoken to all of the whistleblowers it would have subpoenaed for the information it required and examined the plethora of information that other citizens and groups responsible provided and finally without compromising our national security it would have reported all of its findings with its redactions blacked out and submitted to the american people in essence the commission could have produced a final product where the resulting conclusions and recommendations could be trusted instead at the end of the day what we got were some statements that truly insulted the intelligence of the american people violated our loved ones memories and might end up hurting us one day soon one such statement is that 9 11 was a failure of imagination a failure of whose imagination what exactly does that mean when you have a cia director with his hair on fire a system blinking red 52 faa warnings an august 6th 2001 pdb entitled bin laden determined to strike in the united states leads on several 9 11 hijackers including alhazmi almihdhar and marwan al shehi warnings from many foreign governments a phoenix memo warning of islamic extremists taking flying lessons the arrest of would be terrorist zacarias moussauoui facts imparted to one agent agent frasca at the rfu at the fbi 9 11 was truly a failure alright
5495426 patterns of suspicious activity in this country consistent with preparations for hijackings or other types of attacks including recent surveillance of federal buildings in new york
5495427 i think there is very compelling evidence that at least some of the terrorists were assisted not just in financing although that was part of it by a sovereign foreign government and that we have been derelict in our duty to track that down make the further case or find the evidence that would indicate that that is not true and we can look for other reasons why the terrorists were able to function so effectively in the united states
5495428 among other things the report says that leaders of the f a a received 52 intelligence reports from their security branch that mentioned mr bin laden or al qaeda from april to sept 10 2001 that represented half of all the intelligence summaries in that time five of the intelligence reports specifically mentioned al qaedas training or capability to conduct hijackings the report said two mentioned suicide operations although not connected to aviation the report said
5495429 in the two years before the sept 11 attacks the north american aerospace defense command conducted exercises simulating what the white house says was unimaginable at the time hijacked airliners used as weapons to crash into targets and cause mass casualties

5495520 last evening here another nice young man asked me if i knew you and then he asked me something strange like had i heard you were sick or something
5495521 how dare you meet with my ex lover behind my back
5495522 he said he had some things to tell me about you and he wanted to know how you were doing and
5495523 why would he leave without trying to see me what did you say to him that sent him away
5495524 i was afraid he was going to take you away from me that he wanted you back
5495525 so i and i did this to protect you too because he implied he had a private detective after you and then i remembered that p
5495526 i told him you got it from derwood and that i had it too and thats why we were together because no one else would have us diseased like that
5495527 you leave him alone i think you need to leave
5495528 so what excuse are you going to make up for him
5495529 i wanted to tell him something that would make him want to leave us alone
5495530 fuck do you think you can fit in time for
5495531 i heard from about how he embarrassed you at barn dance and your little circular friends
5495532 no paul made sure he left before he had a chance to talk to me
5495533 you told me how marciel was you said he was whacked
5495534 who cares what marciel thinks what are you afraid of
5495535 you dont really care that what he said bothers me do you
5495536 if anything i think youre overreacting again to him actually taking the risks you said you wanted him to take youre being selfish and self centered all you care about is what other people might think about you
5495537 what is this mood youre in youve always been there for me before
5495538 do you think theres a connection between ivins and what was known at the time of the quantico letter there was a letter sent in september of 2001 identifying an arab american scientist at fort detrick as a bioterrorist the letter also threatened a bioterror attack and also death to israel were you ever satisfied that you were able to run down that letter and the author of that letter
5495539 im not aware of any connection to my knowledge theres no evidence linking the two
5495540 were you ever satisfied that you were able to run down that letter and the author of that letter
5495541 fbi spokesman chris murray confirmed tuesday that assaad has been cleared of suspicion murray also said the fbi is not tracking the source of the anonymous letter despite its curious timing coming a matter of days before the existence of anthrax laced mail became known
5495542 it is surely not implausible to suggest that whoever sent the letter had foreknowledge of or some connection to the anthrax attacks and was trying to set up dr assaad as the scapegoat the courant
5495543 which has intrigued federal agents and amateur sleuths on the internet for years
5495544 federal investigators have always maintained that the letter while a startling coincidence has no bearing on their hunt for the anthrax killer
5495545 had i known that the enemy was going to use airplanes to kill on that fateful morning i would have done everything in my power to protect the american people
5495546 thirty six percent of respondents overall said it is very likely or somewhat likely that federal officials either participated in the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon or took no action to stop them because they wanted the united states to go to war in the middle east

5495550 we talked about it for a long time last night we looked at every statistic that we kept from pass completions yards per catch yards after catch interceptions percentage of drives scoring good practices and bad practices we even consulted with some of the players
5495551 really when you look at all the data jordan steffy has earned the spot he was ahead in almost every category
5495552 we rotated the quarterbacks with all the teams for the last nine practices so everybody had an equal shot with every team
5495553 i think theres a credibility thing here if you dont reward kids for practicing well then i dont know what you can base your decision on what made it hard is that chris played well in the games but based on not only fall practice but i even went back to spring practices steffy was far and away ahead in all the statistics
5495554 sree our love is not of the next day stephen me and she sat there and discussed things

5495580 right now its a lot of speculation on what the crowd is going to be and how many different people are going to be coming around
5495581 but based on the information that we have from other towns that hosted a convention and the lack of response i just dont see it being a huge success for us and for some of these other businesses
5495582 were planning on keeping one part of our store open pretty much 24 hours
5495583 it doesnt matter theyre all customers once they walk in the door

5495590 after about a month of training he was already our no 1 person on the team and he hasnt looked back since

5495594 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5495595 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5495596 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5495597 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5495598 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5495599 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5495600 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5495601 i believe you are the senile one warren asked the exact same questions worded exactly the same to both candidates
5495602 ahhh uhhh ahhh ohhh ahhhs and hardly ever finding a word to use is he ever a boring talker probably the worst i have ever listened to
5495603 there was a time in history when harvard was considered a great college and anyone who graduated from there was highly respected and considered to be very intelligent know what changed all that i will give you one guess
5495604 my dad was very excited when i decided to come to clemson
5495605 i felt like it was going to be tough especially at the quarterback position to have your son playing for you
5495606 i didnt want the pressure of trying to be unbiased because im not unbiased i love the kid i see the positives in him i didnt want to put the pressure on our staff that way and i didnt want my wife whos our water girl to tell me who should start at quarterback
5495607 and its hard to do if youre right there in that same town
5495608 hes always been the best dad in the world to me
5495609 when you know and trust the people youre sons going to spend time with it does make it easier
5495610 i just want to do whatever i can do to this team
5495611 this team has been great to me and i just want to return the favor in some form or fashion
5495612 a crisis of confidence is brewing among the peoples of the world it is inevitable that full investigations be conducted by those with the authority and resources of governmental bodies
5495613 this is a primer on sibel edmonds her story will be of interest to anyone concerned about us national security and sovereignty terrorism 9 11 truth and abuse of power by public officials all claims of fact in this article can be sourced in the sibel edmonds us government timeline and the media coverage timeline at the bottom of the article her allegations listed in this article and the documents articles linked in the timelines are not exhaustive
5495614 darpa the white house congress army navy air force nato faa fbi us postal service secret service the naval air systems command irs and the nuclear weapons program of the department of energy
5495615 intentionally and repeatedly thwarted his attempts to launch a more comprehensive investigation to identify and neutralize terrorists
5495616 was merely gathering intelligence so they would know who to arrest when a terrorist attack occurred
5495617 the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states ended its report stating that
5495618 the 9 11 commission thats all a fallacy the 9 11 commission is probably the worst representation of the 9 11 families or for that matter the american public because it is a sham it really is we had tons of questions that we asked them to ask they wouldnt do it and the continuing coverup is just beyond belief
5495619 were asking for a new investigation into the events of september 11th and this time a truly bipartisan global with families invested from the beginning middle and though out the end
5495620 a thorough and definitive investigation by the commission would have addressed all of sibel edmonds concerns and spoken to all of the whistleblowers it would have subpoenaed for the information it required and examined the plethora of information that other citizens and groups responsible provided and finally without compromising our national security it would have reported all of its findings with its redactions blacked out and submitted to the american people in essence the commission could have produced a final product where the resulting conclusions and recommendations could be trusted instead at the end of the day what we got were some statements that truly insulted the intelligence of the american people violated our loved ones memories and might end up hurting us one day soon one such statement is that 9 11 was a failure of imagination a failure of whose imagination what exactly does that mean when you have a cia director with his hair on fire a system blinking red 52 faa warnings an august 6th 2001 pdb entitled bin laden determined to strike in the united states leads on several 9 11 hijackers including alhazmi almihdhar and marwan al shehi warnings from many foreign governments a phoenix memo warning of islamic extremists taking flying lessons the arrest of would be terrorist zacarias moussauoui facts imparted to one agent agent frasca at the rfu at the fbi 9 11 was truly a failure alright
5495621 it is clear that zelikow should never have been permitted to be a member of the commission since it is the mandate of the commission to identify the source of failures we can now see that trail would lead directly to the staff director himself
5495622 i dont have ideas exactly on how 9 11 happened but i know it didnt go as according to what the commission put down on paper and one of the reasons why we still continued to fight with for the commission even as we knew it was a farce is we wanted their words their lies down on paper we wanted to make them go through at least this exercise and even if it came down to the annals of history that the truth will come out that was part of our purpose our purposes were layered well be a pain in the butt thats fine well get their lies down on paper well have more americans wake up to the fact that their government is not looking out for their best interests in fact they may be counter to our best interests but none of this would have come to this point if in fact the commission didnt exist at all
5495623 with regard to the 9 11 attacks it has been said that the intelligence agencies have to be right 100 of the time and the terrorists only have to get lucky once this explanation for the devastating attacks of september 11th simple on its face is wrong in its value because the 9 11 terrorists were not just lucky once they were lucky over and over again allow me to illustrate
5495624 is it luck that aberrant stock trades were not monitored is it luck when 15 visas are awarded based on incomplete forms is it luck when airline security screenings allow hijackers to board planes with box cutters and pepper spray is it luck when emergency faa and norad protocols are not followed is it luck when a national emergency is not reported to top government officials on a timely basis to me luck is something that happens once when you have this repeated pattern of broken protocols broken laws broken communication one cannot still call it luck if at some point we dont look to hold the individuals accountable for not doing their jobs properly then how can we ever expect for terrorists not to get lucky again
5495625 one particular aspect of the report that is quite troubling to me and my organization is the discussion relating to the evacuation orders of the north tower on pages 322 323 of the report and the corresponding endnote numbers 209 it is alleged that many of the firefighters in the north tower heard the message to evacuate but chose to remain in the building prior to its collapse to the contrary this issue of firefighter deaths is directly tied to the lack of radio communication capability this has been well documented in the post 9 11 mckinsey report the ny times and numerous other publications and firefighter comments yet this theory that firefighters chose to die has also been advanced by some public officials undoubtedly hoping to deflect criticism for the inadequacy of the fdny radios and for the absence of a functioning incident command structure in nyc on 9 11 which undoubtedly could have saved so many firefighters lives including my own beautiful son christian
5495626 it is a national scandal the warren commission blew it
5495627 for almost three years now norad officials and faa officials have been able to hide their critical failures that left this country defenseless during two of the worst hours in our history

5495692 the immediate result was many times more than we had expected and we even had to reduce the number of postcards going out each week because we had more calls than we could handle weve always heard that a 1 to 2 percent response is considered very good for a mailing but we are getting at least triple that amount to give you some idea the first weeks mailing went out to our oldest customer account most of whom hadnt done business with us for over a year the first week after the post cards went out we got a 3 percent response on those accounts and six weeks later we are still getting calls from those accounts i also know that it takes time for the response to build and just this past week the sixth or seventh week since we started mailing the postcards we increased from the twenty three calls in per hour average we saw at the beginning of this month to forty five calls per hour in at the end of the month
5495693 thats almost 900 calls in per week more than just four weeks ago

5495733 visst r det konstigt trots kunskap om att det f rekommer verv ld fr n ordningsvakter tar polisen f r givet att i valet mellan tre nerslagna m nniskor och sju utan en skr ma r det de slagna offren som r de skyldiga
5495734 vad r v rst att bli kr nkt och misshandlad att felaktigt d mas i domstol eller den m nga g nger hatiska attityd jag f tt som knivhugg i ryggen och slag rakt i ansiktet detta av samh llets etablissemang som samtidigt gl mmer att det kan vara deras son eller dotter som r kar ut f r n got liknande n sta helg jag t nker inte l ta mig bli klappad p huvudet

5495736 sammantaget anser jag mig ha tillr ckligt underlag f r att kunna konstatera att det inte i obetydlig utstr ckning f rekommer obefogat v ld verv ld och ojuste beteende fr n ordningsvakters sida i samband med ingripanden mot krogg ster
5495737 det finns tillr ckligt underlag f r att h vda att det tycks f rekomma att vissa ordningsvakter i inte obetydlig omfattning talar helt eller delvis osanning n r de h rs i m l r rande krogv ld
5495738 det st r emellertid klart att de krogg ster som uts tts f r l gner fr n vakter samtidigt uts tts f r avsev rda risker i fr ga om r ttss kerheten i de bed mningar som domstolen har att g ra

5495741 att uppr ttelse nu finns tycker jag inte bara r bra utan ven n dv ndigt det m ste finnas forum och medel f r civila att f hj lp men som ordningsvakt r jag ocks utsatt det finns en anledning till att jag b r skyddsv st det r l tt att k nna sig ensam n r det flockas folk runtomkring mig och kollegan

5495767 man k nner sig maktl s de skriver att jag v grat l mna urinprov fast jag tydligt minns att inget ens bett mig om det de ljuger ihop en historia till sin f rdel

5495778 the blood of the blacks runs like water we take their goods and we chase them from our area and our cattle will be in their land the power of sudanese president omer hassan al bashir belongs to the arabs and we will kill you until the end you blacks we have killed your god

5495780 im thinking longevity and a stable career also something exciting to enjoy doing the rest of my life
5495781 it is critical that we gain more agents and other resources on the northern border we are vulnerable
5495782 we have had three shootings in the last year and that is disturbing however we understand and predicted that when we increase resources it puts the onus on the criminals to change tactics move or become more violent and i think thats what were seeing
5495783 its going to be tough being away from family but well worth it in the end
5495784 its definitely something thats a challenge for me but theres so much reward and personal growth
5495785 normally people walk down the sidewalk they dont walk down a bunch of cables grabbing onto poles

5495789 it will be nice to hear the clock chiming again
5495790 so to get it all brought up to date we replaced everything all of the controls the movements the bell ringer the whole nine yards including the hands
5495791 it is nice you dont want to lose those kind of landmarks thats for sure
5495792 its going to be great the bells have always been nice to hear and im thrilled to hear them again

5495796 those who study transsexuality tend to be territorial because they themselves have made so little progress there is no literature that illuminates the underlying mechanisms other than psychological mumbo jumbo and then someone comes striding in and spends two weeks solving the riddle it must be infuriating
5495797 why we often pay too much when we pay nothing
5495798 the world has now seen that even in our time there are political freaks who kill people to achieve their selfish goals and who compensate for their lack of intelligence an a most terrible way by destroying an entire people we will make sure that this crime is not left unpunished

5495805 there were no inappropriate actions that night on our part
5495806 nobody ever believed that she was dangerous but that she was mentally off
5495807 that day there was no doubt she had a piece of pipe and was swinging it at my wife and at me
5495808 my brother and i working together to help her and hopefully that will prevent any future problems
5495809 i hope that she will have access to the help that she needs hopefully the system will be more aware

5495818 good enough i actually even tried to convince myself that i was in love with os to avoid getting serious about the next failboat of a relationship i got into it didnt work because while i love him as a friend i was never in love with him
5495819 we had this enormous list and the job of survey was to try to validate or verify some of what we were hearing in a scientific way
5495820 sometimes the most obvious things are the things we have in common that we dont examine enough that we dont go back to galvanize ourselves to a common purpose
5495821 everything youre saying are the kinds of questions were wrestling with internally
5495822 and were not in a position to release conclusions to those but clearly there are contradictions
5495823 we work very closely with the military particularly along the border region and we would hope and expect that that would continue
5495824 resolving the whither musharraf question may well allow the government in pakistan to now focus on issues of even greater urgency and immediacy like what is happening in the tribal areas
5495825 the new pakistani government may or may not prove to be as reliable of an ally in the has been only time will tell
5495826 the war against extremism is bigger than any one person
5495827 whats important here is that we work with pakistan to do what we can to root out these extremists and prevent them from in afghanistan and carrying out attacks and from attacking targets within pakistan
5495828 make sure that that actually happens and that it matters

5495831 they had details of explosives and poisons along with information about london landmarks and a computer folder on royal residences we would be foolish to rule out the fact that they may have been planning an attack

5495837 we find it appalling that dan lungren is proposing to give billions in tax payer dollars to oil companies when they are already raking in 150 billion in profits
5495838 this big oil energy plan shows just whose side dan lungren is on with 5 3 billion in california we could make real progress toward ending our dependence on oil and creating new energy jobs
5495839 theres a remote possibility they left the canyon without us knowing but theres a strong possibility they are still there
5495840 it means that the third ddg 1000 ship is very likely to go forward and yet theres also the potential of building more ddg 51s

5495843 it was a good day of testing today after a great day of racing yesterday we have tested many different bridgestone tires both front and rear and we have collected a lot of information which will help us for the rest of the season then we worked on some new electronics and mapping but we need to continue with this tomorrow because we havent finished the whole program tomorrow we also have some general set up work to do to try some things that we werent able to check at the weekend due to losing one day to rain we hope that we will have another good day tomorrow finish all of our planned work and then we will leave here in good shape for the final push
5495844 today we concentrated on front tires with michelin who provided us with some different compounds and rubber to try we found some improvement with regards to the wear of the tire which was one of the biggest problems during the weekend but there is still a lot of work to do tomorrow we will shift focus to the rear tire and we hope we can make the most of the day so that we can go to misano in better shape and with more confidence

5495850 photoshopped imagery still had the capacity to surprise in a way thats difficult to imagine today
5495851 if its only one day and then its cool afterwards its not a problem
5495852 but usually these heat waves last for some days and it becomes a health problem
5495853 what im personally very concerned about is the middle east and northern india its a heavily populated area and its already very hot there today but it will become much hotter there so they will experience temperatures that will reach up to 125 degrees fahrenheit
5495854 there its not very easy for people to turn on the air conditioning or to pick up and move just because they dont have as many resources
5495855 my preliminary research on india suggests that the impacts on mortality could be quite dramatic
5495856 i think its becoming clearer and clearer that the costs of climate change wont be spread evenly around the globe unfortunately theyre going to be concentrated in countries least able to deal with them just due to low income levels
5495857 changes in temperature are not going to accrue overnight so there will be a lot of time to adapt
5495858 one of the curiosities on the show was that the oldest person in town who was the chauffeur for the first person who got the disease he didnt get sick which is unusual because usually if youre that old he was i think close to 90 you get sick
5495859 as other people started getting sick they asked him if he could donate some of his blood so they could recover antibodies that might help his wife and other people from the town who had gotten sick
5495860 since i saw the show i thought this is such a great idea why dont we just do it in real life
5495861 we had thought about this before but considered it impossible
5495862 we actually had to find the cells floating around in the blood as if they were sentinels looking for a new infection
5495863 suggests that its possible to make a strong immune response in humans to these types of bird flu viruses
5495864 if you take the cells that make these antibodies and you can treat them in a way to allow them to grow in culture dishes for a long period of time you can then isolate those antibodies and use those antibodies to treat somebody with a severe infection

5495880 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5495881 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5495882 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5495883 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority
5495884 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies

5495900 my obstetrician came and did a quick exam and he said this babys coming
5495901 by 2 38 in the morning she was with us and we heard a little cry a little kitten like sound
5495902 were not really going to know the full extent of any complications she could have until she develops her motor skills
5495903 so well be watching her more closely and things like the first time she lifts her head and the first time she sits up will be even more important to us than they normally would

5495915 i believe in this instance this was a human error caused by an operator
5495916 i have received some information that has caused me concern
5495917 there are other cases that have caused me to believe there have been other instances that an ambulance has showed up at the wrong address than it should have been
5495918 a leader that god has blessed us with at this time
5495919 now you want to win and saying it doesnt make it so
5495920 it would be nice to think that after eight years of economic disaster after eight years of bungled foreign policy of being engaged in a war that should never have been authorized and should never have been waged that cost us a trillion dollars and thousands of lives that people would say lets toss the bums out toss the bums out were starting from scratch were starting over this is not working
5495921 so i understand why a lot of folks are saying this should just happen why are we having to run all these television commercials why do we have to raise all this money just read the papers these are the knuckleheads who have been in charge throw em out but american politics arent that simple
5495922 the fact of the matter is at a certain point when government has not been serving the people for this long people get cynical they tune out and they start saying to themselves a plague on both your houses they are willing to consume negative information more frequently than positive information for good reason theyve seen how promises havent been kept

5495954 wallace collins has previously received 4 000 in donations from this secretive organization that took money from injured workers without their knowledge
5495955 collins has used this money for his own political purposes and should return that money at once
5495956 all candidates and those who had received funds from the working oklahomans alliance
5495957 well if were going to ask wallace collins to give back that money then we should ask all of them
5495958 because everyone who got that money should give it back
5495959 i doubt very seriously if any of these candidates or elected officials knew where that money came from
5495960 in campaigns you dont look gift horses in the mouth
5495961 i havent seen any proof that theyve done anything wrong or illegal
5495962 and i would certainly want to see proof of wrongdoing if thats what happened if mr warren can prove theyve done something illegal then id certainly like to know but just because he doesnt agree with them that doesnt mean theyve done anything illegal
5495963 they are registered with the state ethics commission so i dont know how that makes them secretive
5495964 was an attempt to divert attention away from the gops own problems
5495965 it seems strange ironic maybe that a group that has their own ethical problems such as disgraced former speaker lance cargill who is said to be under an ethics investigation for shaking down lobbyists would point the finger at someone else roger warren should worry about the beam in his own eye before he worries about the splinter in mine
5495966 was an attempt to divert attention away from the gops own problems
5495967 it seems strange ironic maybe that a group that has their own ethical problems such as disgraced former speaker lance cargill who is said to be under an ethics investigation for shaking down lobbyists would point the finger at someone else roger warren should worry about the beam in his own eye before he worries about the splinter in mine

5495971 gaza is completely shut down this will only add to an already dire situation
5495972 as far as im concerned gaza residents will walk without gas for their cars because they have a murderous terrorist regime that doesnt let people in southern israel live in peace
5495973 this explains why his tax plan gives hundreds of thousands in tax breaks for people earning 2 5 million because theyre only middle class
5495974 everyone making 2 5 million or more raise your hands
5495975 i think if youre just talking about income how about five million
5495976 the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
5495977 but i have to say its not an example of putting country first when you say president george bushs economic policies have shown great progress
5495978 mr mccain let me explain to you the economic disaster is happening right now maybe you havent noticed
5495979 this guy obviously does not pump his own gas he obviously does not do his own shopping he obviously does not pay his own bills
5495980 but american politics is never that easy weve got to work hard weve got to earn this election
5495981 we wanted to send a note of appreciation and gratitude to all of you for your messages of support solidarity and sincere empathy as we struggled through the making of our new album declaration a process we detailed publicly back in the beginning of june

5495993 there were only five biosafety level 4 labs places equipped to study highly lethal agents such as ebola that have no human vaccine or treatment a government accountability office report stated last fall fifteen are in operation or under construction now according to the report there are hundreds more biosafety level 3 labs which handle agents such as bacillus anthracis which does have a human vaccine

5496002 before i knew it we were taking the chairs back to the garden from their garage so that i could take the photo
5496003 my interest in this subject has already rubbed off on my two young children who often point out interesting places that mum should photograph as they pass various houses in the car
5496004 i guess this is the kind of thing that happens anywhere that people would rather sit on a couch than on a street bench
5496005 i find it very frustrating i tend to get calls at the worst time i have a one year old daughter and it never fails that the phone will ring when i put her down for a nap or for bed also my vote is private so who do you think you are calling with a survey to find out who i am voting for stop calling me

5496008 however after months of suggesting that the only answer to bring down gas prices is more drilling house republicans today showed their true colors by blocking the drill act a bill which would have decisively and responsibly increased domestic oil production
5496009 in addition to promoting responsible drilling this bill tells the oil companies to drill on the leases they have or let somebody else do it but dont just sit on them while americans are paying 4 a gallon
5496010 i see no reason to give even more handouts of public land to companies enjoying record profits and billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies let them start on the land they already have which will bring oil to the market more quickly
5496011 its about changing the ideas of the western mind a lot of people think arabs especially the bin ladens especially the sons of osama are all terrorists this is not the truth

5496036 sometimes the greatest rewards come from doing the things that scare you the most
5496037 many people die with their music still in them too often its because they are always getting ready to live and before they know it time runs out

5496039 that was the law before the initiative and its nothing new i dont know why wed relax any law
5496040 during the dnc police should be spending their time ensuring the security and safety of those in this city

5496055 we knew we could vastly improve the customer experience by deploying an online booking application to enhance our existing web site ibm came in and really pulled the project together in an amazingly short period of time five months compressing a development cycle that was slated to take 12 months
5496056 when customers book a tour the application is simultaneously booking reservations for hotels buses and so on
5496057 we needed our online system to extend the complexities built into our core business systems out to the web without making the process too complicated for our customers the websphere commerce solution did this without having to completely rewrite our back end systems
5496058 this project is a great example of how ibm is helping clients adapt to constantly changing conditions such as rising fuel costs and new terms of engagement between airlines and travel agencies
5496059 using ibm software and soa companies like vantage can make it easier and less expensive for consumers to book vacations while reducing the time and money it takes to manage a complex business and web site like this

5496070 lead a sustained serious and forceful effort at regional diplomacy to support the legitimate governments in the region against iranian efforts to destabilize them to reassure our friends and allies that the united states supports them in their resistance to iranian efforts at hegemony and to make clear to the government of iran that the united states will protect americas vital national security interests in the middle east
5496071 i dont believe that what i see in iran today is a current grave and urgent danger if a military strike is carried out against iran at this time it would make me unable to continue my work
5496072 a military strike in my opinion would be worse than anything possible it would turn the region into a fireball
5496073 if you do a military strike it will mean that iran if it is not already making nuclear weapons will launch a crash course to build nuclear weapons with the blessing of all iranians even those in the west
5496074 so as much as i hate being in a position where it sounds as though im defending hillary when you hear her bring up rfk and bring up how in the past party nominations have taken a lot longer certainly and then people freak out over her using rfk it kind of sounds like what she was getting at wasnt all that bad
5496075 well i think it sort of her problem is that there is sort of a dark narrative about the clintons right
5496076 there is these stories that follow them about not just being real aggressive towards being aggressive towards being political opponents in the political sense but being real aggressive toward political opponents and different operatives over the years so when she invokes the assassination of senator kennedy it just kinda spotlights this feeling that a lot of people have about her kinda that what wont she do to get elected and thats thats why it just sounded bad
5496077 because of the past history and people wonder is she bring that up just to plant the seed
5496078 yeah i mean its beginning to sound like a weird movie script doesnt it shes kind of like the water skier after he goes down and just not letting go of the rope
5496079 yeah thats right so its probably a two or three day story and itll end up going away but i also think that it it does highlight what a lot of people think about the clintons but obviously not going to that extent but what wont these people do to win this thing

5496097 roskam needs to keep his promises to our soldiers he voted with president george bush and john mccain and voted against soldiers and veterans our troops deserve better treatment they deserve the healthcare and education that they were promised when they signed up
5496098 roskam and his fellow republicans say they support ours troops and then vote against them we need well trained soldiers to protect our nation if we send soldiers in to battle we need to keep our bargains with them after the battle
5496099 its something peter can look at when hes at his desk a reminder of the fun times of the campaign

5496246 so who are using these services a high ranking amazon executive told me there are 60 000 different customers across the various amazon web services and most of them are not the startups that are normally associated with on demand computing rather the biggest customers in both number and amount of computing resources consumed are divisions of banks pharmaceuticals companies and other large corporations who try aws once for a temporary project and then get hooked

5496249 everything i have designed was unnecessary and i am ashamed
5496250 i think ive just continued to get better in the preseason in the games and in practice so this will be another step to take
5496251 to come to a decision like that weve taken a lot of things into consideration last year how orton finished the season training camp preseason games
5496252 in the end it comes down to a gut feeling that you have
5496253 completions turnovers to just the feeling we have on who can manage the game the best for us all of things like that
5496254 and the good thing about evaluating both rex and kyle weve had a long time to do it its been quite a few years weve had a chance to see both guys play
5496255 people make such a big deal about that my rookie year and everything but i think everybody on this team has gotten better since they were a rookie and not just me
5496256 that stuffs in the past and im just focused on playing good football now
5496257 my accuracy has improved my command of the offense has improved and just being able to play at a high level
5496258 both guys were in the same situation which is a good part about it
5496259 both guys played both preseason games with the same line i think we did about what we could to let them compete fairly for the position
5496260 i wasnt even sure what the contract situation was to be honest
5496261 no competitor will agree with a decision when it doesnt go their way
5496262 rex is a team player hes been in this situation before and hell do whatever he needs to do to help our football team win
5496263 we dont name any guys starters for lifetime or anything like that but we feel real good about kyle just like we feel good about olin kreutz being our center and lance briggs being our linebacker
5496264 no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other
5496265 i dont understand why they dislike me so much to inflict this sort of pain
5496266 i dont know why he would say it obviously he is emotional about this

5496295 it may be typical of the pro obama dungeons amp dragons crowd to disparage a fellow countrymans memory of war from the comfort of moms basement but most americans have the humility and gratitude to respect and learn from the memories of men who suffered on behalf of others

5496301 dont worry well be home soon be a good boy
5496302 of all the wonderful and vast number of metrics and dimensions this is the best he could come up with
5496303 creativity arises out of the tension between spontaneity and limitations the latter like the river banks forcing the spontaneity into the various forms which are essential to the work of art or poem
5496304 if you excite them they will implement your testing platform tags
5496305 seriously though i am constantly surprised at how vendors all of em promise the moon in the sales process and dont even take time to do the basics for their clients
5496306 pay us for training or read our help center and fix things yourself
5496307 all data in aggregate is not useful it is only when you segment that you can find something of value
5496308 life has been tough for marketers especially making decisions using data hits on a website dont mean anything anymore
5496309 organic and paid is one of those basics given the atleast temporary importance of search as an acquisition vehicle
5496310 privilege is another of the devices used by the political parties to score points off one another
5496311 in the final analysis a breach of privilege is what the majority says it is the law to be applied is vague in the extreme adjudication for breach of privilege is really in the nature of a political trial for which the penalties are not defined by law but at the whim of politicians
5496312 i cant speculate on what mr glenn took from that conversation but i did not believe i in any way indicated anything other than payment of the tauranga electoral petition fees
5496313 the position is that i have not rendered a fee note to the solicitor for the work done
5496314 and that solicitor has not rendered a bill to winston until my instructing solicitor renders a bill to winston there is no debt owed by winston
5496315 is enormous elasticity on the part of new zealand first im also amazed at how hundreds of thousands of dollars can be run up and run down between two people a lawyer and a barrister and a senior politician and with no records kept i think its fair to say i tend to be a bit more careful with money than that

5496334 members of congress nuns war heroes and other suspicious characters with names like robert johnson and gary smith have become trapped in the kafkaesque clutches of this list with little hope of escape
5496335 congress needs to fix it the terrorist screening center needs to fix it or the next president needs to fix it but it has to be done soon
5496336 americas new million record watch list is a perfect symbol for whats wrong with this administrations approach to security its unfair out of control a waste of resources treats the rights of the innocent as an afterthought and is a very real impediment in the lives of millions of travelers in this country
5496337 putting a million names on a watch list is a guarantee that the list will do more harm than good by interfering with the travel of innocent people and wasting huge amounts of our limited security resources on bureaucratic wheel spinning
5496338 i doubt this thing would even be effective at catching a real terrorist
5496339 thanks avinash that was really great youve opened our eyes but
5496340 we have been banging out heads on this one for six years
5496341 i proposed testing surveys competitive intelligence analysts but i was shot down
5496342 my manager simply does not get it analytics web me anything
5496343 it is not my opinion that dancing monkeys or grey text on black background dont work here is data from our latest test
5496344 excellent idea why dont we split traffic and send 50 of the home page traffic to your idea and get customer feedback on a no calls to action only video home page
5496345 heres how much money we make now heres how much we will be making when we do my idea
5496346 in three months the sites performance by every measure improved dramatically conversion went up cpc and cpas went up bounce rate went down and what not in short we made the website owner a hero in the company
5496347 cmon lets just test whether this must have because our competitor has it gadget really does help
5496348 heres the click data please pay attention to it no then ok i will try again
5496349 whats one question you wish you could get answered about our website or whats one thing you could learn from our website visitors
5496350 data but if you start there they will have very little appreciation for why it is important to listen to you whats your hook not the purple shirt and pretty jeans you are wearing today its outcomes and impact
5496351 respect for the individual and the acknowledgement the i am factor
5496352 the key to talking web analytics is to not let anyone know youre talking web analytics
5496353 its complex its time consuming its statistics and its worth it
5496354 web analytics is like angelina jolie its sexy it kicks butt and is a goodwill ambassador
5496355 avinash we are not that simple we have three to nine tools i am using one my marketers are using others to measure success we have conflicting numbers and we are at each others throats whats up with that
5496356 you are making me lose faith in humanity dont give me a problem give me a solution
5496357 ok ok john but what about cookie deletion and privacy blockers thats
5496358 hey look this banner campaign was fantastic just look at these results
5496359 which of the following helped you in your decision to buy from us
5496360 stanek proved that the exact same clause obama said wasnt in the bill was actually placed in the bill by the very committee obama chaired yet he still voted against it
5496361 the rabbits simple lines and uncluttered face make it look very similar to its golf predecessor
5496362 forward leaning stance is emphasized by the narrowing side window line and the hatchback rear window
5496363 notably the word rabbit does not appear anywhere on the car instead a small chrome bunny cast mid hop decorates the hatch of volkswagens entry level compact
5496364 although larger and heavier than before it retains the characteristic boxy but very functional hatchback architecture
5496365 the rabbits acceleration time to 60 mph is a somewhat laggard nine seconds
5496366 gas mileage with the optional automatic transmission is 21 mpg in the city and 29 mpg on the highway
5496367 the word sprint can justifiably be used to describe the rabbits straight line performance
5496368 thanks to the engines respectable amount of torque acceleration is brisk at lower speeds with either gearbox
5496369 the rabbits five cylinder engine is unique in its class as competitors use four cylinder motors
5496370 shares its 2 5 liter inline five cylinder engine with the jetta
5496371 thanks to improved airflow and valve train management output in both cars increases to 170 horsepower and 177 pounds feet of torque up from 150 hp and 170 pounds feet last year
5496372 torque pours forth from small motions of your right foot
5496373 manual gearbox is tight and guides between gears with little effort
5496374 enjoyable tone thats rare in the world of turbocharged cars the engine also provides plenty of torque at low rpm to make squirts through urban traffic quite easy
5496375 six speed sequential shifting automated manual called dsg the dsg transmission can be shifted via paddles on the steering wheel or placed in fully automatic mode
5496376 for a gti with the regular six speed manual expect a 0 60 mph time of about 6 7 seconds
5496377 snaps off shifts as soon as you flick the wheel mounted paddles
5496378 selecting the sport setting results in it downshifting often with a clunk when its really not needed
5496379 21 mpg in the city and 29 mpg on the highway
5496380 fuel economy for the 2008 rabbit is a bit lower than average for this class of car
5496381 models sold in california emissions states earn a cleaner pzev tailpipe emission rating
5496382 the rabbit rewards high corner entry speed with a chassis able not only to help you survive the experience but also to facilitate tire squealing fun
5496383 a stiff body structure and multilink rear suspension combine to help deliver comfortably compliant ride and handling
5496384 lament the loss of some steering feel due to the adoption of electric assisted power steering
5496385 falls a bit short of cars like the civic si and cooper s in terms of handling and driver enjoyment
5496386 there is some discernable body roll but big body motions are kept commendably in check the steering is precise but feedback is muted the brakes shrugged off repeated full threshold braking zones as if they were made from dry ice no smell no smoke and not a hint of fade very impressive
5496387 the r32 is fairly forgiving when pushed hard tending toward understeer that diminishes as speed is scrubbed off
5496388 sends the power to all four wheels via volkswagens 4motion all wheel drive system
5496389 the r32s sport seats borrowed from the gti grip well without forcing you to climb into them
5496390 nearly 2 inches of legroom and more than an inch of headroom over the previous model
5496391 a roomy rear seat offers decent room for a pair of adults
5496392 the main advantage to the four door gti is its more accessible rear seat though the front seats slide forward quite easily to improve entry and exit
5496393 when flipped down opens up a massive 43 cubic feet of cargo space
5496394 taller cupholders to fully secure many of todays larger drinks
5496395 a cleanly styled interior takes advantage of volkswagens long touted cabin building competence fit and finish is impressive for a 15 000 vehicle and of particular note are the audi quality gauges and controls other materials such as the laminated visor and hard plastic door inserts appear less than top drawer
5496396 the insurance institute for highway safety gives the rabbit a top score of good
5496397 dual front airbags front side impact airbags and side curtain airbags
5496398 active front seat head restraints help to properly position passengers during an impact
5496399 tilt telescopic steering wheel maintains the proper distance between the driver and the steering wheels airbag
5496400 stability control with electronic differential lock is optional as are rear seat side impact airbags on four doors
5496401 a passenger seat that folds flat and 60 40 split folding rear seats enhance versatility
5496402 comes as a two door or four door five passenger hatchback in a single trim level called the s
5496403 15 inch wheels air conditioning heated outside mirrors power windows and locks remote keyless entry cruise control and a 60 40 split folding rear seat
5496404 a telescopic steering wheel side impact and side curtain airbags and four wheel disc brakes with abs ebd and brake assist
5496405 upgraded cloth upholstery eight way manually adjustable front seats heated front seats heated windshield washer nozzles rear passenger ventilation and a rear center armrest with pass through
5496406 xenon hid headlights 17 inch alloy wheels heated outside mirrors full power accessories air conditioning cruise control sport front seats a 60 40 split rear seat and a 10 speaker six cd mp3 audio system with satellite radio an auxiliary jack and steering wheel mounted audio controls

5496415 a quick note your micro conversions dont have to lead up to the macro conversion though in this case they kind of do
5496416 whats the point of micro conversions not leading up to the macro conversion
5496417 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
5496418 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
5496419 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5496420 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5496421 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5496422 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5496423 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5496424 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks
5496425 the heavy rains caused a shift within a natural gas main caused a slight leak
5496426 we did clear out the baggage area of terminal 1 for about 30 minutes i guess that would be from 3 to 3 30
5496427 it opened up at 3 30 when passengers came back down doing the process of getting their bags probably about five flights had passengers waiting for a few minutes to get down to their bags
5496428 when i was the ruler of the world this is why people did this
5496429 why did comments about log in issues started to go up on tuesday and then back down on friday
5496430 web 2 0 for stealing is called borrowing borrow away
5496431 oh i see this guy makes frequent stops on the southside in a drug infested neighborhood he must be at a higher risk than someone who never leaves the dominion give him higher rates
5496432 as a result of this trend up or down what was the impact on the company and its customers
5496433 and that both from executive and also operational dashboards i as a manager must see the numbers as i posses more knowledge about the business strategy potential reasoning behind metric fluctuation actual action opportunities etc
5496434 what are our options for adding text to the dashboards you offer
5496435 because we need to be able to add context interpretation to the data
5496436 this one of the core reasons why most dashboards are crappy i e they are data pukes that provide little in terms of context and even less in terms of actionable value
5496437 our previous system for managing email only allowed one employee to log in at any one time
5496438 she was tryin to get him to come with her but he just let her go so he could go back and get his brothers and sisters
5496439 she can work through it were a close knit family as long as she stays around us we cant do anything but show her love
5496440 shes a nice strong person and she cares so much about my brother deon she is crazy about him
5496441 i think thats all everyone is waiting on at least something of him is left behind
5496442 we dont use any burial vaults we dont use any conventional caskets such as copper bronze or hardwood baskets
5496443 everything is biodegradable so it will go back to nature
5496444 do we need to expend that kind of energy on a box we are going to use for one or two days and then bury forever
5496445 are putting out privately that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5496446 i volunteer at the church when im not at my ranch
5496447 pastor rick asked me to escort senator mccain to the green room when he arrived
5496448 he just sat right down and put his fingers in his ears and started hummin real loud
5496449 it was just him a chair and a glass of water next to him on a table he smiled and i left
5496450 some of the obama people grabbed me in the hall and asked the same things you did
5496451 when i mentioned the water glass they got real excited
5496452 they asked if it was the kind of glass you could put over your ear and hold against a wall you know if you wanted to listen to something outside i said yeah i guess he could but he had his fingers in his ears and was hummin real loud when i left
5496453 one of them just started yelling call andrea call andrea say you arent gonna use my name are you
5496454 in 2006 the most recent year for which statistics are available 4 810 motorcyclists and their passengers were killed in crashes across america
5496455 i would be particularly interested to hear your views on the merits of requiring vertically integrated energy companies to report the accounts of their supply and generation businesses separately
5496456 this has never happened before airlines and travel agents work closely together and have done for years
5496457 put in place proper systems to inform passengers that their flights have been cancelled
5496458 whether to accept bookings via intermediaries is a commercial decision for ryanair
5496459 some seats were obviously missing parts some were obviously very old
5496460 we installed two of the better looking seats thinking that they were okay only to find that they were not working
5496461 one was missing the top part of the harness that would secure the child in a crash the other had a seatbelt that wouldnt tighten enough to secure our child it took us quite some time to find working seats to install
5496462 the seats were also filthy with huge black marks on some and dirt or crumbs on others
5496463 in california there are clear laws regarding child safety seat rental these old non working seats were not only unsafe they were also against the law
5496464 i dont have any knowledge about car seats beyond what a well informed parent would have after purchasing their own seats and using them daily in my opinion it is something that advantage employees should have recognized
5496465 if you see a company putting people at risk take action to make it better
5496466 this smell can make you feel sick give you a headache make you feel nauseous or cause other health effects
5496467 its a mess when you create its a mess when you get rid of it and its off gassing when youre using it
5496468 we have not been given that authority by the congress
5496469 we want consumers to have an enhanced peace of mind
5496470 it is very clear to our members that rescissions are not necessarily the way to go we want to make sure people are covered you also have to have mechanisms in place to prevent fraud
5496471 the goal is to try to put a stop to this practice because it is hurting a lot of people
5496472 it is not only a financial burden on the people when their coverage is pulled they cant get treatment
5496473 were not breaking out the percentage between the two states
5496474 these are legal issues so we do not have any comment
5496475 i cried when they told me i had cancer i cried when they told me i needed a hysterectomy i sobbed when i got the letter from health net
5496476 i was counting on them to carry me through the hardest thing i would ever go through they let me down
5496477 none of them shows any kind of serious problems or concerns
5496478 we would try to clarify that with the member before the policy is rescinded
5496479 you have to show that you can provide all those services at all times its a huge endeavor
5496480 because they couldnt afford to keep all the services up and running
5496481 there really isnt much difference except the american college of surgeons is much stricter
5496482 if one was to look at the old testament as the movie scism portrays there would be a need to reform that too but christianity never did
5496483 muslims are also commanded by god in the quran itself to take the quran critically and not to accept it blindly
5496484 and if it were from any other than allah they would have found in it many a discrepancy
5496485 the koran is to be taken literally while the bible is viewed more like a set of guidelines
5496486 i am sure that god who began the good work within you will keep right on helping you grow in his grace until his task within you is finally finished on that day when jesus christ returns
5496487 these things i plan wont happen right away slowly steadily surely the time approaches when the vision will be fulfilled if it seems slow do not despair for these things will surely come to pass just be patient they will not be overdue a single day
5496488 im sorry casey i didnt mean for you to get hurt
5496489 momma ruth says no to anything that makes her have to get up shes that lazy
5496490 we are continually looking at ways to improve our website on behalf of our customers and regularly ask for feedback and comments on how they feel it could be improved for their benefit
5496491 of course we expected the cgp to be popular because as green building grows many consumers are looking for a builder with real credentials in todays market
5496492 as we see demand for green buildings continue to grow we are seeing the market respond as people skill up and get the appropriate training
5496493 a recent federation of master builders report showed that the value of the refurbishment market will be 4bn a year and countless studies have shown that to meet carbon emission targets there needs to be a focus on retrofitting older buildings
5496494 so there is a strong case for developing these skills even in the current climate for new build
5496495 were seeing a lot of demand from employers but while you get a lot of people interested in those jobs it is a fairly limited pool of people who have the required experience and qualifications
5496496 we have already started the planning for an integrated product and we aim to have this available as soon as possible
5496497 from a product perspective this acquisition will propel the company forward
5496498 happy is the man who doesnt give in and do wrong when he is tempted for afterwards he will get as his reward the crown of life that god has promised those who love him
5496499 when the holy spirit controls our lives he will produce this kind of fruit in us love joy peace patience kindness goodness faithfulness gentleness and self control
5496500 in the last few days i have enjoyed sitting by a lovely lake with friends and hiking along a small river flowing out of the mountains of south carolina words i heard from robert h schuller years ago came to mind that water is gods tranquilizer the lord is my shepherd i shall not want he makes me lie down in green pastures he leads me beside still waters he restores my soul
5496501 like cold water to a thirsty soul so is good news from a far country
5496502 their delight is in the law of the the lord and on his law they meditate day and night they are like trees planted by streams of water
5496503 does god sometimes hide from us why dont i feel him
5496504 where can i go from your spirit where can i flee from your presence
5496505 how can i daily even hourly moment to moment experience god in my life
5496506 the holiest most ordinary and most necessary practice of the spiritual life is that of the presence of god it is to take delight in and become accustomed to his divine company speaking humbly and conversing lovingly with him all the time at every moment without rule or measure especially in times of temptation suffering dryness weariness even infidelity and sin
5496507 whatever you do in word or deed do everything in the name of the lord jesus giving thanks to god the father through him
5496508 as the deer pants for streams of water so my soul longs for you o god
5496509 there is no way of life in the world more agreeable and delightful than continual conversation with god only those who practice and experience it can understand this
5496510 this is all i could line up for my hiatus from 24
5496511 there was a writers strike coming i was in a hurry
5496512 ive been living in my body a lot longer than my daughter has in hers
5496513 we will be closing in 10 minutes please shop accordingly
5496514 i cant say its going to be a slam dunk for the government if this reaches court but i will say the information in those affidavits is impressive
5496515 mural on indian red ground 1950 which is considered to be one of his finest
5496516 a work by abstract expressionist willem de kooning was traded for rare illustrated pages of the shahnameh an iranian epic poem
5496517 frank boye has sued sothebys alleging breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty regarding two paintings by paul fisher and wrongly delivered by the defendant to the wrong person on 2006 after receipt of due notice of ownership they seek 1 million
5496518 are counting on the legal system to protect their shoddy work
5496519 im not saying the first thing you do when you find a vulnerability is to post it on your blog
5496520 but getting injunctions against people is like saying to them if you didnt find it this problem wouldnt exist
5496521 leadership is the ability of a single individual through his or her actions to motivate others to higher levels of achievement
5496522 the gap in revenue per employee between google and sap and salesforce com for instance indicates that google would more likely be more interested in what ebay does or in monetizing youtube than in zoho or salesforce coms barely profitable business companies invest in what generates the best return on investment
5496523 googles margins are a once in a lifetime occurrence and google will move in that high growth why microsoft is so desperate about search it has a higher growth rate we are more worried about microsoft than google microsoft will address the internet but pulling down office margins is a challenge for them no company peacefully accepts a lowering of margins
5496524 our intention is to help erode microsofts profit margin coming in from below
5496525 if salesforce is a proxy it would be difficult for google to justify the investment more costs are associated with support than in r amp d even with on demand software the moment you have paying customers the expectations are different and google is finding that out with recent gmail problems
5496526 one of the privileges we enjoy as a private company is to not disclose revenue profit numbers which lets us do the kind of analysis on competitors they cant do on us
5496527 did you see the muscles on that window cleaner he must really work out
5496528 the governments most recent report on microgeneration predicted 90 per cent compound annual growth rate for the ground source heat pump market
5496529 even if they are wrong by a factor of three it is still a massively expanding market
5496530 were focused on heat pumps as they are mature technology that are already used prolifically in scandinavia
5496531 the only issue is the upfront capital costs but they still offer returns on investment within five to seven years even for retrofitted systems which is far quicker than other microgeneration systems such as solar panels
5496532 the type of service it is you need national coverage and a local presence
5496533 were getting inquiries in from yorkshire for example and we can respond to them far quicker with a local presence
5496534 durante tres largos a os hemos estado diciendo que war est llegando y el equipo ha estado trabajando mucho para cumplir esa promesa
5496535 this attempt to overturn the tenant protection act speaks to the absolute necessity of having this law on the books obviously some landlords feel they need to protect a pattern of behavior designed for only one purpose to get people out of their homes this bill was the product of 14 months of thoughtful collaboration with tenants advocates and landlords and we are confident it will stand up to any lega challenge instead of forcing us to waste taxpayer money in court landlords should use their resources to ensure full compliance with the law
5496536 it is my intent to take the information derived from all those investigations along with an examination of best practices of other swat teams in the united states to determine what we can do to enhance our internal practices
5496537 i believe police are here to serve and protect citizens of this community if there is a perceived high risk threat to apprehend a person police move that mission to secure and apprehend under no circumstances do police move to a search and destroy mission
5496538 theres really is no justification for shooting you cant shoot at a shadow and shoot at what you think is a target and not be sure especially when that home is occupied by children
5496539 if these steps are taken and there can be some accountability it seems to be a positive step
5496540 that kind of policy cannot be tolerated in our community
5496541 if you had just been across the street and said anthony put up your hands he would have and surrendered
5496542 i dont want to retry the case i just want to make sure it doesnt happen again
5496543 uma solu o do jeito mais civilizado e respeitoso poss vel
5496544 she is one of those people who you look at and get a big smile on your face
5496545 if youre in a bad mood she will put you in a good mood bless her heart for being here it wouldnt be the same if we didnt have mary
5496546 this is something she looks forward to she cant talk much but still all the kids get to know her here they all take care of her this is what she lives for through the whole year
5496547 mary has been amazing with the little and big kids
5496548 mary loves the fair she never leaves they are just amazing people ron is my right hand guy
5496549 we just cannot thank them enough for everything they have done for us
5496550 when someone in our group does really well she is really supportive and gives you hugs if you dont do well she says youll do better next year
5496551 there is a point in every time when they go from they need 4 h to 4 h needs them and it is real neat to see that change
5496552 not just rabbit people but everybody 4 h is a lot of work but the benefits you get out of it are just unreal just to see children grow up to young adults
5496553 for the presidency this is going to be a national security election and national security is a nonpartisan issue
5496554 new york becomes a purple state and not a blue state
5496555 ive talked with the representative once on the telephone he wished me well the relationship as far as i am concerned is very good
5496556 its just one of those things where obviously i thought i was the better person for the job and he should have thought he was the better person for the job thats what america is all about you think you have something to offer and you think you have something to share and you go for it
5496557 i knew more what to expect this time around than i did the last time i worked hard the first time and i worked just as hard this time
5496558 but when you are doing something for the very first time you dont really know what to expect the first time i didnt realize how much hard work was involved and how much travel and how much time
5496559 this time i did realize that and i am learning every day
5496560 im going to work as hard as i can i have an opponent in the fall i take nothing for granted
5496561 i worked hard during the primary and im going to continue to work hard so i guess its full speed ahead
5496562 i dont think its a factor one way or the other im me you are not voting for anyone else except for kent stevens when you are voting for me
5496563 we live in america everybody in the commonwealth of kentucky and in the united states of america should have affordable health care
5496564 that whole way of thinking to do something like that on the last day of adjournment is unconscionable the liberal democratic leadership of the house walked away from its responsibility to the american people
5496565 pavarotti captivated millions with his performances at the met and elsewhere and his golden voice will resonate in this opera house for as long as it stands
5496566 if you know me youve heard this rant before there is one fact that bothers me to death the dearth of female artists in the country music hall of fame
5496567 i think sometimes that we love the myths of music so much that we forget that there were a lot of people having the same ideas at the same time that dont necessarily get credit for the eureka moments of music history
5496568 my rants have usually been about how the country music hall of fame has so few women in it
5496569 but if you just stay focused on that it becomes kind of bitter and not that interesting after a while and a sour grapes sounding topic
5496570 i couldve scripted the whole thing myself and done an entire show of my favorites
5496571 but while the people that im obsessed about are interesting to me i thought it might also be cool to open up the idea to some other women so it wouldnt be just my own little private obsession
5496572 they asked me if i had an idea that would work with the space and some kind of thematic idea seemed like it would be a good starting place
5496573 for a show that saluted women artists that may be obscure now but who made influential music
5496574 she and i have had this conversation every so often about women country artists
5496575 i put the idea to her and megans suggestion was buffy sainte marie
5496576 right away i was glad that id opened the evening up and have people bring their own ideas
5496577 we also have a girl joining us named theresa anderson who is swedish but has been living in new orleans
5496578 her own music is not a retro soul thing at all but she is really into the whole new orleans soul scene that stretches back into the 50s and 60s
5496579 she never really got above the regional hit level and kind of missed the gravy train of national success
5496580 but she grew up in the pacific northwest in a folk music loving family
5496581 if wed made the cut off no grammy winners lucinda would be out of bounds
5496582 but i thought it might be interesting to have someone contemporary in the mix
5496583 ive tended to play the hank williams covers and the tunes of hers that have remained a part of the country music repertoire but there are recordings floating around out there of her doing gospel shows and for this ive picked a couple tunes from that part of her musical life
5496584 ranking basado en un sistema de puntos seg n las competiciones jugadas por los equipos
5496585 i had a lump on my back the size of a watermelon
5496586 its not derogatory or in your face i was doing everything out of desperation trying to feel somewhat secure and somewhat confident somewhat content and somewhat preoccupied i think its quite appropriate
5496587 the record is not supposed to be nasty or even insulting
5496588 although there are moments of that i just wanted to make a record and this was the only thing i could conjure up
5496589 its about a woman who was drowned by her true love
5496590 this man drowns his bride and goes on this journey of self loathing but it turns out he has no conscience and hes just a murderer the woman dies but theres a rebirth of all these incarnations of the woman
5496591 theyll come in saying teacher you didnt tell me what is summer of the whore

5496594 you need to be twice as aware of whats going on you need to have your head constantly on the swivel because you never know a lot of times vehicles claim they dont see us we need to make sure we maintain our speed limit

5496601 although they were slower to get normal results over time they basically became normal just like those individuals who had sort of milder infections
5496602 you know i can cut the grass paint the house clean the pool
5496603 the assumption in the past was that either you know how to look or you dont
5496604 this is not true you can train people to look educators as well as artists know that
5496605 quite often when students miss a diagnosis they tell us they didnt look
5496606 we trained students to become literate in talking to patients but we didnt have a way to make them be visually literate
5496607 you can look at a face and observe certain aspects of it like lines on a face the colour of it the colour of the eyelids the colour of the lips these are all things once you are trained to look for it you do better at it
5496608 not only how to look at body and face but to look at patterns the work of jackson pollock has no face and no body so what is important is pattern recognition
5496609 they have to be able to look at the human being they have to be able to pick up cues that are not necessarily communicated verbally so much is not communicated verbally
5496610 the common factor here which is the human is so subjective the science that we practise is so subjective that you have to train the physician to be good at both the human brings the science and the art together
5496611 never ever forget to say i love you to your partner

5496613 is it ethical for health care professionals to support the administration of drugs that are of unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed
5496614 in this way supervised injection sites undercut the ethics of medical practice and set a debilitating example for all physicians and nurses both present and future in canada who might begin to question whether its ok to let someone overdose in their care
5496615 imagine for a moment a doctor that has a patient with a serious but treatable case of cancer
5496616 there is a better alternative for injection drug users and that is treatment even if they fail treatment the first time we can help them to get up and try again
5496617 this is an issue that is not on the table
5496618 the public doesnt know who on earth john mccain is

5496628 the nyt newsroom was buzzing late monday afternoon after obama beat reporter jeff zeleny learned how the dem hopeful has now finalized his choice for a running mate obama has set out an elaborate roll out to

5496635 senator mccains proposal is bold its aggressive its an all of the above approach
5496636 senator obama has taken a very minimalist or none of the above or very few of the above approaches
5496637 pawlenty has called for a civil and respectful campaign and yet virtually every time i turn on the television set i see ads that are on the part of mccain that are grossly misleading
5496638 i personally believe that if barack obama gets elected he will slam the door shut on these options
5496639 if senator mccain is elected he will open the door to these options and allow our energy supply to be increased and take some of the pressure off our energy crisis in the country
5496640 midwesterners like authenticity and not someone who is phony or too glitzy senator mccain is authentic and if you look at how his issues line up with mainstream voters they line up more closely than barack obamas do all of those things are going to serve him well in the midwest
5496641 shes running out of gas a bit and just needs a couple of days to spark up a bit and refresh
5496642 i knew my chances of progressing wouldnt be too bad because the field wasnt jumping super
5496643 they were pretty close calls but she was getting tired and lacked a little bit of spark tonight
5496644 they were faults that she wouldnt normally have its been a tough few days and its just catching up with her a bit
5496645 obviously it didnt start off too great being the reserve but i knew i had a good horse then she got the opportunity to go and things have improved from there

5496649 and as you know the mccain campaign is running that commercial where theyre comparing barack obama to various hollywood celebrities and as you know if theres one thing the republicans will not stand for its electing some hollywood celebrity to public office except for ronald reagan fred thompson arnold schwarzenegger clint eastwood you know except for those
5496650 john mccain does not want dick cheney to attend the republican convention because he says hes too unpopular yeah and when asked to comment cheney said i hope the senator reconsiders then he turned into a bat and flew away
5496651 according to the huffington post its being reported that barack obama may name indiana senator evan bayh as his vice presidential running mate heres what we know about evan bayh he was going to run for president then he dropped out after getting less than 2 of the vote less that 2 he was actually losing to low fat milk
5496652 barack obama still continuing to dominate media coverage the new york times just did a big piece they say that barack obama has been successful in politics because hes a black man who doesnt make white people feel threatened yeah yeah which explains obamas secret service code name al roker

5496660 u s population 300 million 13 000 restaurants china population 1 3 billion and 800 restaurants easily were talking 10 000 to 5 000 restaurants as it continues to develop so the opportunity is endless
5496661 mistakes we made in the past you dont open just one store
5496662 you get three or four or five deals done build them consecutively train the crew consecutively so you save on the money so when a truck goes out from the distribution center its not carrying one store its carrying the products for three to five
5496663 drive through was a brand new concept anywhere in china
5496664 we have a lot of traffic and im walking around they pick up the food and then they went and parked their car they brought their bag of food and they went inside
5496665 and i watched this happened several times and i think we might have a problem here on how the chinese use the drive thru
5496666 its off the beaten path of beijing so its a suburb coming out
5496667 its a little grittier but its like an oasis to me im guessing we might be a little premature here from the mcdonalds side but with only upside potential
5496668 we were telling each other lets go out and make history lets go out and get this sweep
5496669 i felt like we were the best three in the world
5496670 i came to the birds nest to lay a golden egg and thats what i did brown trafton said
5496671 the usa hasnt really had a great showing so far and we wanted to uplift the track team with the sweep taylor said
5496672 i feel like a famous singer or actress the whole stage is only for me its so cool she said
5496673 if that works for her and obviously it is she should keep doing it said stuczynski whose best jump 15 9 was 4 3 4 inches short of the u s record she set at the olympic trials

5496680 you hit five guys and you hit our leaders youre going to pay for it
5496681 we not only lost the game but our catcher lefebvre said
5496682 if you come in and have a collision at home you never hit someone in the chest it was an illegal slide and the umpire should have ejected laporta thats where the game got out of control
5496683 it was a close game at that point i wasnt trying to take him out that was the nature of the play if the guy hadnt blocked home it would have been fine if they cant accept that thats not my problem
5496684 pc guys say ps3 guys have aim assist and the controls nerfed for them and ps3 guys say pc guys have a mouse and keyboard its all easier for them even if its not true
5496685 not somebody who i exchange ideas from on a regular basis
5496686 you never really know what to expect coming in but i think things have gone pretty well
5496687 im learning the defense and im enjoying playing with my teammates and i like the coaches a lot i cant complain about anything
5496688 youre never promised anything you just go out there and do your work and see what happens thats what im doing im trying to work and thats the same thing hes doing
5496689 im really glad i got the opportunity to play all three positions in cincinnati that was a very valuable experience because as far as going into a game and having a feel for all three spots
5496690 im just looking forward to the season and hopefully i can help us win
5496691 i mean theres a little saying the more you can do the better so you cant limit yourself to anything you have to keep an open mind and learn as much as possible as quick as possible and then just be ready wherever they need you
5496692 he was a player we liked a guy who had been productive with his other team
5496693 and he was our kind of guy and so we thought he fit well
5496694 where he ends up is a little bit on him so far hes done a good job and hes a guy were very happy with
5496695 it was a little learning process early in camp but the last 10 days or so ive felt really really comfortable there on the left side
5496696 i feel like im kind of picking up where i left off
5496697 hes played both of them for us and we think hes played at a high level we thought it was natural the way the draft fell and being able to get a tackle in the draft that we felt was worthy of starting we felt that moving gross gave us the best chance at the tackle positions
5496698 when youre going down the interstate for almost 20 years you see the same people working the same hours at the same place we just figured wed give it a shot

5496769 disturbing facts and figures that illustrate the consequences of having no access to sanitation
5496770 but it is worth noting that very many people are still not familiar with the statistics or even aware that there is a global sanitation crisis
5496771 these people use a fancy toilet which is connected to an effective sewer system and they are probably unaware that this toilet and its flushing system are critical to a healthy life
5496772 the year is not over yet but i would like to take a look at what the iys has achieved so far
5496773 if we are to reach the target we now need to provide at least 173 million people per year with access to improved sanitation
5496774 when i visited ethiopia earlier this year i learned that 1 3 million latrines had been built within 18 months in the countrys southern nations province
5496775 unsgab will continue to call a spade a spade or perhaps i should say a toilet a toilet and ladies and gentlemen i hope i can inspire you to do the same
5496776 is the iys 2008 making enough impact on the ground will our activities lead to sustainable improvements
5496777 in other words how many more people are gaining access to improved sanitation facilities how many have already paid a visit to the toilet how many now experience improved sanitation as a basic facility

5496783 wat een interessante folder ik hier heb over emotioneel lichaamswerk dat lijkt me wel spannend
5496784 dat is je reinste flauwekul opgezet door liefdeloze op geld beluste types ik raad je aan die folder onmiddellijk bij het oud papier te gooien
5496785 nu we het toch over emotioneel lichaamswerk hebben wat doen we met onze voor inschrijving bij het sint pieters en bloklands gasthuis zeker het duurt nog wel een jaar of vijftig dus zo rond ons 110e voordat we daar gezellig gaan wonen maar het is goed er al even bij stil te staan nu de directeur van dat verzorgingshuis een ruimingsmethode heeft bedacht tegen de vergrijzing
5496786 tja heel nederland valt nu over die man heen maar op zich is het niet zo gek wat hij doet
5496787 alleen is het absurd om dat aan een bepaalde leeftijd te koppelen dan is er namelijk sprake van leeftijdsdiscriminatie en dat kan niet
5496788 je kunt ook mensen van nog geen veertig jaar oud hebben die na een herseninfarct en reanimatie als kasplantje aan een infuus voort moeten
5496789 aan de andere kant zijn er 85 plussers die na een reanimatie nog vele jaren vrolijk voortleven met wijntje en trijntje
5496790 op zich is het wel goed aan mensen te vragen of ze een reanimatie willen
5496791 maar dat moet zodanig gebeuren dat timide ouderen niet het gevoel krijgen dat ze te veel zijn of de maatschappij te veel geld kosten daar zijn dus uitgebreide invoelende gesprekken voor nodig in plaats van een kil wel niet formulier en die gesprekken moeten minstens iedere twee jaar worden herhaald want niets veranderlijker dan een mens
5496792 in the first place we should insist that if the immigrant who comes here in good faith becomes an american and assimilates himself to us he shall be treated on an exact equality with everyone else for it is an outrage to discriminate against any such man because of creed or birthplace or origin but this is predicated upon the persons becoming in every facet an american and nothing but an american there can be no divided allegiance here any man who says he is an american but something else also isnt an american at all we have room for but one flag the american flag we have room for but one language here and that is the english language and we have room for but one sole loyalty and that is a loyalty to the american people
5496793 let us say to the immigrant not that we hope he will learn english but that he has got to
5496794 by the use of the hyphen and along the lines of national origin is certain to a breed of spirit of bitterness and prejudice and dislike between great bodies of our citizens if some citizens band together as german americans or irish americans then after a while others are certain to band together as english americans or scandinavian americans and every such banding together every attempt to make for political purposes a german american alliance or a scandinavian american alliance means down at the bottom an effort against the interest of straight out american citizenship an effort to bring into our nation the bitter old world rivalries and jealousies and hatreds

5496805 i actually am i am still a virgin and i havent done everything with a boy except for french kiss i wanna try other things but i do not know i just havent had the opportunity to yet and im afraid i wouldnt know what to do but i think about it late at night when im lying in bed i wonder what it is like to be touched and kissed between my legs it always makes me wet my pjs
5496806 ohmigosh this is the first time ive admitted it but yes i do i dont use toys or everything just my fingers since its the summer it gets really hawt at night so i like to sleep naked that leads to me touching myself at first i could only get one finger in cause i am so tight but i kept working at it now when i get really wet from rubbing my clitoris i can fit two fingers in i wonder how it will feel with a guys thingie in there
5496807 when we launched our free sms service to the world we set the clock ticking
5496808 as the service grew in popularity so too would the price because mobile operators in most of the world charge users to send updates
5496809 when you send one message to twitter and we send it to ten followers you arent charged ten because weve been footing the bill
5496810 its sic poor customer relations whether its sic free or not
5496811 if twitter plan to make a profit somehow they need customers and this aint how you build a loyal fanbase
5496812 we took a risk hoping to bring more nations onboard and more mobile operators around to our way of thinking but weve arrived at a point where the responsible thing to do is slow our costs and take a different approach
5496813 international billing is a significant project and not something we are comfortable focusing on before we have a dependable offering
5496814 its not right to charge for spotty service and we know there are bugs

5496819 a soon as i got off the plane my internal clock started ticking i only have a matter of time it was in the back of my mind the whole time you try to soak as much as you can knowing it will never be enough
5496820 i tried to get myself emotionally ready but when i walked in and saw my children i broke down and cried i thought it would be something i could handle and i think im handling it well people have some compassion for me but i dont think they understand
5496821 it would be different if amy was up here but were basically on opposite sides of the continent
5496822 im ok it just breaks my heart that hes missing something so important were kind of racking our brains trying to figure out what to do about it
5496823 when youre single you have lot of time to focus on other things now i just want to get home and help her out as much as i can my son isnt worried about if i made a block lift weights or got to a meeting on time hes just worried about me holding him

5496825 i got about an hours sleep every night last week
5496826 i ran from one crib to another i was like a nascar pit crew changing 1 000 diapers
5496827 but i wouldnt trade it for anything i love it i just look at everything as a real blessing my dad said he can see im in awe of this experience i really am not me but my wife and everything shes gone through i get choked up thinking about it

5496855 we found that shorter slimmer females with long slender legs a curvy figure and larger breasts are more attractive
5496856 it is widely believed that human beings are attracted to one another as a result of their prospect as a mate who will yield higher quality offspring for the chooser
5496857 larger breasts are quite conspicuous and this is what males are attending to rather than symmetry
5496858 because bodily asymmetries are too subtle to be seen with the naked eye evolution has instead engineered more conspicuous signals and displays such as broad shoulders curvy waist lines or smooth dance moves to indicate mate quality

5496912 we are delighted beyond words that an operator of excaliburs quality is opening a 100 pokerpro poker room on the strip it is commentary on how far pokertek and automated poker have come in such a short time

5496914 weve opened a successful 20 plus table room in montreal a beautiful 12 table room in michigan a high end 12 table room in atlantic city and now 12 tables in the gaming hub of the world las vegas with more than 230 pokerpro tables currently installed worldwide we are ready for the nevada market

5496916 were going to have a great daily tournament schedule tremendous player promotions and more than that well be laying down games that manual rooms just cant for example our pot limit omaha games will be getting out 30 hands per hour that is unheard of for a game as popular as plo and only pokerpro can offer that kind of speed
5496917 i am so excited that automated poker is finally going to exist in vegas
5496918 pokerpro is an amazing way to play the game the speed and accuracy beats any manual table you will find me in the excaliburs poker room from time to time and i challenge all poker players to try this

5496921 while online search solutions largely focus on returning relevant listings or links to sites that have the best probability of providing the information the user is looking for there are certain challenges to replicating this framework in resource constrained mobile environments
5496922 mobile data sessions are of relatively smaller durations and the user experience can be enhanced by providing accurate and relevant answers instead of links for users
5496923 interestingly more than 70 percent of new users text a query to chacha more than one time and 22 5 percent of users text more than twenty five times per month
5496924 this is a clear indication of the stickiness of chachas service which is both entertaining and productive
5496925 nmts product portfolio focuses on developing new parameters and types of monitoring and is at the cutting edge of the patient monitoring market

5496927 while this system is pending fda approval it has potential applications in many different kinds of emergency response
5496928 the use of complete non contact monitoring is a perfect example of innovation and in many ways is the future of patient monitoring especially in remote settings

5496987 we pointed out that we the community asked for safe pedestrian crossing not a full traffic light which we know will probably lead to cut through traffic from the 2
5496988 even many of the meadow proponents were upset they wanted an instant access ped only crosswalk midblock dot dept of trans amp garcettis office placed it at earl to provide safe access to silver lake blvd as thats a nasty double blind curve i know enough about traffic engineering to know that you cant do instant access for peds because the result is traffic grinds to a halt with constant stop cycles and then youve got jams and even more upset people its worth remembering that it was a big struggle even to get a signalized crossing here as the previous dot mgr totally nixed it and garcetti got it fast tracked as it was clear it was important to give the meadow path project safe access so it happens and it became yet another silver lake drama fest

5496998 the war against extremism is bigger than any one person

5497000 what would you like to say about abortion and euthanasia in washington state
5497001 what would you like to say about abortion and euthanasia in washington state
5497002 now we believe in the separation of church and state but we do not believe in the separation of faith and politics because faith is just a worldview and everybody has some kind of worldview and its important to know what they are
5497003 related to that our americas responsibility in the world religious persecution
5497004 i think the first thing we have to do is to bear witness and speak out and not pretend that its not taking place
5497005 so having an administration thats speaking out joining in international forums where we can point out human rights abuses and the absence of religious freedom that i think is absolutely critical over time what we are doing is setting up new norms and creating a universal principle that peoples faith and peoples beliefs have to be protected and as you said its not just christians weve got to make sure one thing that i think is very important for us to do on all these issues is to lead by example thats why i think its so important for us to have religious tolerance here in the united states thats why its so important for us when we are criticizing other countries about rule of law to make sure that were abiding by rule of law and habeas corpus and were not engaging in torture because that gives us a more or less standard to talk about these other issues
5497006 religious persecution what do you think the us should do to end religious persecution for instance in china in iraq and in many of our allies im not just talking about persecution of christianity particularly with the persecution around the world that persecutes millions of people
5497007 the president of the united states has the greatest asset in the bully pulpit
5497008 our judeo christian principles dictate that we do what we can to help people who are pressed throughout the world and i would like to tell you that i still think that even in the worse places in the world today and in the darkest corners little countries like belarus they still harbor this hope and dream some day to be like us and have freedom and democracy we have our flaws and we have our failings and we talk about them all the time and we should but we remain my friends the most unusual experiment in history and im privileged to spend every day of my life in it i know what it is like to be without it

5497039 the victorian institute of teaching has developed a code of conduct and i believe this sort of behaviour doesnt meet these norms
5497040 but i do have sympathy for him because im sure he is a very good teacher and i think it was more naive behaviour in an increasingly technological world
5497041 i know that there are tools on facebook that can limit others looking in but teachers still need to consider what they are posting because they are role models for children every day and after hours
5497042 the community has expectations of what is appropriate and people need to be respectful of those standards

5497066 this group wants to have a debate thats not what these career days are for
5497067 if we open it up to them others seeing it as a forum for discussion will want to set up tables too
5497068 but most of the horror stories they told were from far off in other parts of the country not in bridgewater
5497069 because im not hearing complaints from people here in town im not sure we need to do anything about this

5497112 he mccain was in a panel the other day with rick warren some of you may have seen it and rick warren asked him how do you define rich
5497113 i guess if youre making 3 million dollars a year youre middle class
5497114 i think if youre just talking about income how about 5 million dollars
5497115 im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
5497116 as was immediately predicted by john mccain after he made the remark barack obama is already distorting his comment about the definition of rich in america remember when barack obama said he was tired of distortion name calling and sound bite solutions to complicated problems neither do we
5497117 asked about defining who is rich in the context of raising taxes
5497118 firmly believes in not raising any americans taxes its not the job of government to define who is rich

5497139 respondents answered yes or no to was there ever a time that you would have gotten better medical care if you had belonged to a different ethnic group
5497140 however we were not able to ask why they felt discriminated against
5497141 the longer someone delays cancer screening the worse the outcome
5497142 perception of discrimination may be driving the differences we see in outcomes among minorities
5497143 this has serious public health implications as we know that higher levels of screening lead to lower levels of mortality
5497144 clinicians need to be aware that they may be sending signals even unintentionally that lead minorities to believe they are being discriminated against
5497145 these market leading projects we have in california are something that can be extrapolated around the world

5497148 i have a piece of tissue that looks like a spinal disc a sand bag tough as nails on the outside and like sand on the inside
5497149 in a month the torn tissue will be completely regrown and healed
5497150 i wish i could have had a procedure like this
5497151 this will lead to human treatments but they cant move as fast as we can
5497152 after a few weeks of lab growth it will turn into something that resembles a tendon but it has to be the mechanical equivalent and we dont know that were there
5497153 stem cells are very promising but what they do for horses may not work so well for humans because humans are the hardest animal to rebuild
5497154 often that injury is a complete tear the ligament is snapped in two and the ends ball up and even if you untangle them and pull them together they wont heal
5497155 so they take part of the patella tendon which is short and tough and stretch it and staple it to the bones so not only is your acl not working too well and you have to stretch it out but your knee hurts like crazy
5497156 if we can learn to grow a tendon that works right or figure out how to make the acl heal back together we can save a lot of people a lot of pain
5497157 the body knows how to heal itself were speeding up and concentrating the process
5497158 ninety three percent got better with a single injection and stayed better for two years
5497159 i will guess that five years from now insurance companies wont authorize surgery until the patient has tried and failed at prp
5497160 we dont always know how stem cells when injected into some tissues work their magic
5497161 veterinarians dont go back and study the horses tendons to figure out what the stem cells did to promote healing
5497162 there are all kinds of ways stem cells could work if we could understand how they are actually promoting better function of the tissue we might be able to further improve their therapeutic effects
5497163 youre putting in cells that want to grow that has to be under control
5497164 theres a nagging feeling that theres a cancer stem cell that when its agitated by exposure to carcinogens or radiation or something it goes nuts and that we cant identify it from the other stem cells
5497165 how do you find this bad boy and pull him out
5497166 and theres a nagging worry its the same cell we only know these cells by what theyve done and by the time theyve become cancer its too late
5497167 we simply are not going to sacrifice the integrity of the certification process for expediency
5497168 we need the federal oversight to create consistent standards and to hold the manufacturers to a certain level of quality but we also have to be able to get the equipment when we need it
5497169 right now that equipment is not coming and were left making contingency plans
5497170 the problem is that the pace of innovation is outstripping the pace of regulation
5497171 federal certification is intended to help election officials manage voting technology but right now its getting in the way instead
5497172 the e a c to its credit has decided to dig their collective heels in and insist that the software and hardware be rigorously tested by professional testing labs

5497184 dwindling population is spread so thinly across a territory so vast that it no longer even makes demographic sense as a country

5497189 in relazione alle notizie giunte dagli stati uniti essendo in contatto con il ministro delle politiche agricole alimentari e forestali luca zaia posso affermare che il ministro stesso in stretta collaborazione con gli uffici governativi e lambasciata italiana in usa si sta adoperando per comprendere e risolvere la questione
5497190 sono gi al lavoro per il nobile di montepulciano e cercher di chiarire e risolvere la situazione in tempi brevi in queste ore sto cercando di contattare gli americani per trovare una situazione immediata e tempestiva a questo nuovo caso dopo quello del brunello vorrei subito chiarire per che non un caso di sicurezza alimentare da fonti statunitensi abbiamo saputo che si tratta di un caso che riguarda una zona circoscritta ribadiamo che la qualit del montepulciano ottima ma se qualcuno ha sbagliato pagher senza che questo per metta a repentaglio il lavoro di quei produttori onesti che rispettano le regole
5497191 c per forza un modo diverso di fare le cose un modo etico e morale che dipende soprattutto dai proprietari delle aziende che pur di vendere si affidano al mago zurl di turno pompato dalla stampa dalle stelle e dai bicchieri ed essere onesti non deve mai pi essere sinonimo di essere bischeri ma una medaglia da appuntarsi sul petto ed andarne fieri ogni giorno della propria vita
5497192 heres to the crazy ones the misfits the rebels the troublemakers the round pegs in the square holes the ones who see things differently theyre not fond of rules and they have no respect for the status quo you can praise them disagree with them quote them disbelieve them glorify or vilify them about the only thing you cant do is ignore them because they change things they invent they imagine they heal they explore they create they inspire they push the human race forward maybe they have to be crazy how else can you stare at an empty canvas and see a work of art or sit in silence and hear a song thats never been written or gaze at a red planet and see a laboratory on wheels we make tools for these kinds of people while some see them as the crazy ones we see genius because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do
5497193 by the end of the day if the weather cooperates we can probably get all of our tourists out of there
5497194 it was definitely frightening and there was a lot of whoa what are we going to do next and whats the morning going to bring
5497195 i woke up to people yelling weve got to get out of here
5497196 we booked it up a cliff in 10 seconds and we just saw this massive rush of water rage down the creek side
5497197 thats all it took just a few days of very heavy thunderstorms
5497198 looking at hindsight obviously we would do things differently today
5497199 were we perfect absolutely not weve had missteps and those are the lessons learned it was over the last few years that we were able to incorporate all of the lessons learned that we have throughout this investigation
5497200 his only response was that he wanted to hang out there which was not a very compelling reason
5497201 they had stiff alibis or they were not in a position to take the material for purposes of this kind
5497202 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5497203 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5497204 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5497205 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5497206 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5497207 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5497208 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home
5497209 the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5497210 sometimes its difficult to know what a politician will actually do once in office because they say different things at different times to different people
5497211 this is a particular problem when a candidate has a short thin record on the issue as is the case of sen obama
5497212 i dont think your opinion qualifies as fact good luck proving it we all know your not going to do anything about it

5497230 there were only five biosafety level 4 labs places equipped to study highly lethal agents such as ebola that have no human vaccine or treatment a government accountability office report stated last fall fifteen are in operation or under construction now according to the report there are hundreds more biosafety level 3 labs which handle agents such as bacillus anthracis which does have a human vaccine

5497241 they certainly dont want to see their dollars flowing off their fields scientists and farmers need to continue working together to minimise the transfer of nutrients from land to sea
5497242 we believe it would be unrealistic to return to pre industrial levels of nutrient input to oceans but an appropriate management goal would be to reduce nutrient inputs to levels that occurred in the middle of the past century
5497243 whether or not these observed changes in oxygen can be attributed to global warming alone is still unresolved

5497249 new york is complaining youre too pro environment and they say youre ignoring the costs of environmental protection they want you to cover the internal revenue service
5497250 there is abundant evidence that the trillions of pounds of hazardous pollutants that have been poured into the environment are in all likelihood responsible for much of the sickness suffering and too often death of americas children
5497251 the effect on childrens health is like a world trade center in slow motion
5497252 no disease has ever been documented that stems from legal applications of pesticides
5497253 jennys persistence and determination are probably what allowed her to come through it all
5497254 remains dangerous for thousands of years and no nation on earth has developed an acceptable solution for safely disposing of it
5497255 efficiency programs and renewables such as wind and solar can provide more carbon abatement per dollar while avoiding the downsides of nuclear power
5497256 the supposed nuclear revival is a carefully manufactured illusion that seeks to become a self fulfilling prophecy
5497257 new nuclear power plants are not a solution for americas energy needs
5497258 serious questions of safety security waste and proliferation surround the issue of nuclear power until these questions are resolved satisfactorily environmental defense cannot support an expansion of nuclear generating capacity
5497259 and while it can be argued that the actual risks of nuclear power are far lower than the perceived risks and that coal fired power plants have killed a far greater number of people than nuclear energy most communities do not want nuclear plants nearby

5497262 developing countries be obliged to join their industrialized counterparts in cutting greenhouse gas emissions under a new international framework to combat global warming to come into force in 2013
5497263 the united states and russia have joined with us this year and now all g8 countries agree on the goal of a 50 percent reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 moreover g8 leaders have also accepted our longstanding argument that the post 2012 global climate change framework must include all major emitters
5497264 developing countries are not obliged to cut co2 emissions under the current framework
5497265 except for small island countries and the worlds least developed nations japan will propose that developing countries be categorized based on certain indicators such as per capita gross domestic product and their percentage of global co2 emissions based on indicators showing the economic development levels of developing countries japan will demand those nations also be obliged to cut emissions the japanese proposal aims to try to persuade emerging economies such as brazil china and india to accept obligatory greenhouse gas emissions cuts
5497266 hey i can tell youre busy why dont you call me later when you have time

5497271 rhea its time you told us what is going on
5497272 of course this makes sense now excuse me because i was in the middle of a fantastic matlock rerun
5497273 by the end of the day if the weather cooperates we can probably get all of our tourists out of there
5497274 it was definitely frightening and there was a lot of whoa what are we going to do next and whats the morning going to bring
5497275 i woke up to people yelling weve got to get out of here
5497276 we booked it up a cliff in 10 seconds and we just saw this massive rush of water rage down the creek side
5497277 thats all it took just a few days of very heavy thunderstorms
5497278 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
5497279 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
5497280 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
5497281 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
5497282 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
5497283 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
5497284 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
5497285 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
5497286 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
5497287 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
5497288 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
5497289 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
5497290 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
5497291 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
5497292 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
5497293 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
5497294 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
5497295 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
5497296 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
5497297 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
5497298 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
5497299 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
5497300 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
5497301 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
5497302 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
5497303 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
5497304 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
5497305 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
5497306 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
5497307 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
5497308 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
5497309 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
5497310 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
5497311 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone
5497312 various medical authorities swarm in and out of here predicting i have between two days and two months to live
5497313 you know marcel proust french writer total loser never had a real job unrequited love affairs gay spent 20 years writing a book almost no one reads but hes also probably the greatest writer since shakespeare anyway he uh he gets down to the end of his life and he looks back and decides that all those years he suffered those were the best years of his life cause they made him who he was all those years he was happy you know total waste didnt learn a thing so if you sleep until youre 18 ah think of the suffering youre gonna miss i mean high school high school those are your prime suffering years you dont get better suffering than that
5497314 in order to defeat your evil villain you only need remember this every problem can be solved with sufficient explosives
5497315 we officially passed final cert on our first try friday august 15th
5497316 we remain dedicated to finding and prosecuting the person responsible for nilanthans murder irrespective of whether the incident is racially motivated or otherwise however should that prove to be the case it only serves to further highlight the tragedy of this young mans murder
5497317 we have now spoken to several witnesses and built up a good description of the suspect given that the suspect returned approximately 30 minutes after the exchange of words at the traffic lights it is highly likely he lives locally the taxi driver has not come forward yet and it is vitally important we hear from him
5497318 words cant express how i feel right now he was energetic always giving a helping hand whenever it was needed every day every second we will be thinking of him
5497319 the investigators have made a significant stride and hopefully this dreadful case is coming to its conclusion
5497320 a number of individuals were detained and questioned as a result of a proactive operation
5497321 consequently some have been charged with drug related offences unconnected to the mullanys murder the two females arrested and charged last week are still in custody at her majestys prison
5497322 we are not in a position to disclose any details regarding their arrests and charges except to say they are linked to the other three persons presently in police custody
5497323 we were informed this morning of the news from antigua and we are pleased at how the investigation is progressing
5497324 we are not going to make any further comment at this time and we would ask that the media continues to respect our privacy
5497325 earlier today we informed the families of ben and catherine mullany of the latest developments in antigua the force is continuing its support of the ongoing investigation and trained family liaison officers are continuing to support the families and keep them fully updated on events both in the uk and antigua
5497326 the whole country was in shock from this terrible crime
5497327 these charges will bring some degree of relief to the families of the victims the community and everyone who values life
5497328 one who is not taking part in the battle nor has the sheer intention to die is in the branch of hypocrisy
5497329 what i want to do is cause trouble for the kuffar non believers with hit and runs everywhere cause fear and panic in their countries make them nervous so they make mistakes
5497330 the material in their possession promoted extreme ideology most notoriously of osama bin laden of al qaida as well as groups in various countries that adopted it
5497331 these men were not simply in possession of material which expressed extremist views they were also in possession of material that was operationally useful to anyone wishing to carry out an act of violence or terrorism
5497332 these people have uploaded games and made them available to tens of thousands of people
5497333 what they are trying to do is deter people from illegally filesharing their games this is not a massive revenue generating exercise
5497334 these sorts of problems occur everywhere and we are going to take action over this but i must point out that the number of robberies on tourists has gone down
5497335 there will be a lot of people taking advantage of the late august bank holiday so we expect the roads to the main holiday centres ports and airports will be busy
5497336 we are doing everything we can to help drivers with their journeys we have removed as many roadworks as possible and we also provide a number of information services that will help drivers
5497337 at the moment it seems that there might be fewer people driving long distances over this bank holiday weekend but it will still be busier than your typical weekend
5497338 this will be a particularly busy weekend for us with more than 140 000 people using the eurostar but we are reasonably confident that services will run as usual
5497339 if you carry a knife you are now more likely to get caught more likely to be prosecuted and more likely to go to prison if found guilty
5497340 no one wants to see the devastation i saw my friend and the family go through
5497341 you dont expect situations that are happening whereby people go to school in the morning and then you never see them again because of incidents that have happened we have got to help we have got a voice that kids listen to so it is important we get involved in something like this
5497342 i will never forget the day that the headmaster brought the school to a halt and said that stephen had been killed the night before it was a crazy atmosphere in school very sombre and chilling something like that really does hit home one day he is enjoying life talking about doing an art a level and the next day he is gone
5497343 in the past maybe there wasnt a strong enough deterrent for carrying knives if you go to prison now it will be a step in the right direction people need to know it is not always the person intending to hurt someone who gets injured people carrying the knives also get hurt
5497344 communities and youth centres also need to play a bigger part boredom can set in a lot of times there is a lot of peer pressure and then something happens that everyone regrets
5497345 im delighted the fa and the england team are supporting our campaign warning youngsters about the severe consequences of knife crime
5497346 you can only solve this by working together the england players are role models for this generation and i hope their messages have a positive impact
5497347 you have shown that you are a very dangerous individual indeed i consider that you pose a very significant risk to the public and you are a dangerous offender
5497348 forensic analysis by computer experts established that the defendant had 241 000 indecent photographs of children being one of the largest seizures of indecent photographs in the uk
5497349 this website while appearing to operate on the margins of legality was clearly a front for the sinister sexual abuse of children and an image trading ground for paedophiles
5497350 everyone in task force helmand is affected by the death of a soldier and the thoughts and sympathies of us all are with the family at this most difficult time
5497351 this was a tragic incident a family member can never be replaced and it is always painful when civilians particularly women and children are involved
5497352 while it is unclear exactly what caused their death an investigation is under way what is clear is that taliban fighters were in the area and showed a total disregard for the presence of civilians near them
5497353 the taliban use tactics in which they cause civilian life to be at risk they have no regard for the afghan people and support for the taliban in helmand is reducing
5497354 it cost me 20 to build the prototype and in the developing world it would be a lot less
5497355 when i write a song it takes on a life of its own

5497359 commodore bainimarama had the opportunity through his attendance at the forum to explain this decision in person to pacific leaders
5497360 fiji will still be despite his absence a major feature of leaders discussions in niue
5497361 my assessment is that leaders feel that the events in fiji are really casting a stain on the
5497362 the leaders want to be seen and have the forum be seen to continue to be leading international opinion and action on the issue
5497363 the pacific forum needs to understand that we in fiji will decide what is in our national interest in the short and the long term
5497364 one of the basic inalienable civil rights guaranteed to an individual

5497367 a single returned piece of mail is not a reliable basis for challenging the right to vote
5497368 mail may be returned for many reasons including errors in the database from which the mailing is derived errors in the mailing labels failure to include an apartment number or poor matching criteria
5497369 voter suppression and intimidation is driven by a desire to maintain the status quo
5497370 these acts are carried out in an effort to deprive certain americans especially those most marginalized of a voice in our democracy election day is the great equalizer it is the one day where if all was right in our democracy it would not matter if a person is rich poor black white educated or not we all would have the same amount of power

5497414 if some ministers spoke less of resolution 1701 that brought nothing but peace and quiet to the north we wouldnt be seen as weak

5497417 if some ministers spoke less of resolution 1701 that brought nothing but peace and quiet to the north we wouldnt be seen as weak

5497619 commitment to tackle terrorism to promote dialogue with india especially over kashmir and to root out corruption
5497620 the announcement by president musharraf that he is standing down as president brings to a close a critical period in pakistans history and its relations with the uk and other countries
5497621 pakistan is a vital friend of the uk and it is essential for britains security never mind the personal ties that bind nearly one million british people to pakistan that it has a strong and democratic government with a clear mandate and programme for thorough going reform of its social political and economic structures
5497622 in this context the musharraf years yielded significant dividends notably in the economic field but also until last autumn in areas like media freedom
5497623 it is important to highlight president musharrafs commitment to tackle terrorism to promote dialogue with india especially over kashmir and to root out corruption
5497624 but reform depends above all on legitimacy and that is why the uk has been at pains to stress the importance for pakistan of strong institutions rather than strong individuals and why we believe a strong democracy is key
5497625 the responsibilities on political leaders in pakistan are now significant they need to come together to ensure that the recently elected government carries forward an economic and security agenda consistent with the long term interests of the pakistani people
5497626 the uk will remain strongly committed to its partnership with the pakistani people notably through our aid programme
5497627 we will also continue to deepen our security cooperation with the new government
5497628 and we will be clear about the essential nature of a new partnership between pakistan and afghanistan
5497629 i look forward to the early election of a new president in pakistan to take forward the important shared work that binds our two countries together
5497630 during president musharrafs time in office we have seen a deepening of uk pakistan relations
5497631 in afghanistan whether it is forced or not forced it is a crime because the islamic rules say that it is
5497632 i think it is good there are many diseases that can be created in todays world such as hiv through illegal sexual relations

5497636 what exactly is it that mr lanny davis of the law firm orrick herrington amp sutcliffe sees as such a threat from the election of anchorage mayor mark begich to ted stevens seat in the u s senate why are evan bayh and lindsey graham so eager to promote lanny davis books wonkette thinks lanny davis is off his meds but i think wonkette fails to understand the nature of the bipartisan permanent government that seeks to maintain control of both parties no matter who wins individual elections they are the people that agreed to embark of george and dicks excellent adventure in mesopotamia and that ever since have sought to cover up for that mistake and protect their interests
5497637 do you begin to see why progressives threw a fit when we saw evan bayhs name on the short list for barack obamas running mate

5497653 keep silent and cover up short comings of people so that you remain secured and safe
5497654 one who covers up short comings of a muslim allah would reward him by covering him up in this world and in the hereafter

5497665 we have assumed that for the first 72 hours we should rely on no one but ourselves because thats how long it takes for help to come

5497671 what really impressed me with this property and the rme team was the amount of information that was available to me before i actually clicked on a property i had all my due diligence done for me right there on the website
5497672 we know what its like to follow a real estate agent around with our children in the back seat of the car making multiple offers and being refused multiple times we dont have the time to do that so its wonderful to leverage other peoples time and expertise
5497673 we always knew we should be doing something in real estate for the long term but didnt have a clue as to how to get started after being involved in nouveau riche and attending the training seminars we decided to take the plunge and buy that first property it was kind of scary to click on the button but we knew we had to start somewhere it went very well rme made the whole process go very smoothly
5497674 when you can take advantage of someone else going out and providing the deals the way they do its awesome

5497690 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5497691 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5497692 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5497693 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5497715 this is a gesture to abu mazen abbas and the palestinian people for the upcoming month of ramadan
5497716 strengthen the peace process and moderate palestinians and to demonstrate clearly that the path of moderation and the path of negotiations is the path that can deliver results
5497717 when israel releases prisoners only to groups that exert force it sends out the message that it gives in to pressure and that the use of violence and kidnapping are effective ways of acting against israel
5497718 instead of adopting a resolute stance against terrorism the kadima labor government continues to release hundreds of prisoners in return for nothing likud will
5497719 crushes the publics faith that murderers and terrorists will receive their due punishment and will harm israeli citizens security and the efforts to release gilad schalit

5497726 its very easy to cause a lot of trouble using three guys and a laptop
5497727 the question that remains is was it planned or was it something that happened by coincidence or was it a bit of both
5497728 what makes this different is that the targets are no longer strictly military communications infrastructure and were now talking about destroying civilian internet sites
5497729 people are frustrated and apprehensive and are saying what can we do to make it right
5497730 it is up to us the four nations people we need to work together to come up with a long term solutions against the gangs the drugs and the violence but our community has to take charge
5497731 these communities have to recognize that they have a problem with some of these young people that are out there with their gang ties and this lifestyle with drugs and the violence and they can go home to grandma and grandma will accept them and love them unconditionally kamins said
5497732 well the grandmas and other community leaders have to stop and say wait a minute
5497733 the hardened criminals and the entrenched gang members are committing these crimes and they are committing violence and they are hurting the community terribly
5497734 we have to balance that on the other hand with the fact that we have a lot of people involved in gangs who may be rehabilitated
5497735 they are our people they are our children they are our community members our relatives and it may look simple and easy from someone on the outside but to us it isnt that simple

5497753 the truth is that gordon browns old fashioned leftist idea that only the state can guarantee fairness has led to a decade of top down state control policies that have made the country less fair browns labour means an unfair britain
5497754 this autumn we are going to step up the pressure to make sure that gordon browns obsession with his own short term survival does not do long term damage to britain that would not be fair

5497759 ended with own pal jimmy olsen asking her to marry him just before she was arrested by government officials
5497760 i am directing this year so thats a totally new beast to tackle
5497761 so im looking at the show in a very different way also theres something so wonderful about the family that weve built so coming back just doesnt feel like i am coming back to work on smallville it really feels like i am coming home in a lot of ways its really nice to come back and enjoy that kind of fall into the warm embrace of the family thats being built there
5497762 what i mean is that as an actor its my job to make everything interesting and exciting and new and if i am not doing my job well then i am stealing
5497763 so coming back i think its important to keep it fresh and its important to be excited because i think thats part of why i get paid
5497764 i dont have the script and i have no idea what its going to look like other then its not going to have a lot of chloe in it
5497765 i followed around a couple of directors and was there every day sitting in the chair just asking questions and writing things down
5497766 now that its been confirmed again i come in and i have my directing homework and i go over it with james marshall marizee almas whos our first assistant director and glen winter whos a director of photography im trying to learn as much as i can its amazing making a tv show is incredible the things that go into it and the amount of work oh my god its amazing
5497767 and i love film so much and i love the whole process of making film this is just sort of the next step of understanding it on a deeper level i always want to be telling stories in whatever fashion i can and directing is really just understanding learning a different element of that storytelling process
5497768 i dont know shes really diving head first into the isis and shes really taking on the job of being the mentor and the kind of place of solace for all the meteor infected so i think that thats really going to see her be focused and shes pretty angry at lex luthor so shes going to stay as far away from him and his cohorts as possible
5497769 its time for him to grow up a little bit and not rely on chloe so much so that chloe can go off and forge her own path
5497770 shes been his shadow for a really long time and while she has been doing things of great importance i think its really exciting to see her start to see her kind of forge her own way and figure out what shes passionate about separate and aside from clark you really start to see her do that at the isis foundation and shes really narrowing down her scope of what she wants to focus on which is really to try and help that part of the population in the world and i think thats really cool
5497771 i think chloe is really taking on the whole mother teresa kind of thing thats been looming around since she started her superpower of healing a couple of season ago
5497772 shes got such a huge heart and she is recognizing that there are more people that need her other than clark kent which is another reason i think she sort of starting to cut the apron strings and let clark venture into his own sort of thing cause she is really seeing how many people need her help and bette is just the first of i think many
5497773 aka doomsday and as always clark kent chloe has her hands full when it comes to the men in her life
5497774 i know i have such a stable to choose from now its really so horrible
5497775 obviously my relationship with clark is still going strong and were kind of always trying to find our footing and figure out if were in love or just friends or whats going on then shes got jimmy whos just this beautiful amazing supportive stable realistic man who i think she really seeks to find solace in and kind of use this as a way to ground herself in some sort of sense of stability so she goes to him a lot when things feel kind of crazy but now she has this new hero paramedic davis guy whos pursuing her pretty actively is incredibly attractive and very kind and interesting and also a little dark so shes really got three to choose from and you know there is always the green arrow and hes just fun to play with
5497776 im learning more and more about the comics as we go cause i dont know a lot about the superman comics so just finding out a couple of weeks ago that doomsday actually kills superman in the comics and being a part of the struggle between the dark and the light side again i think is really exciting so im really looking forward to it and sam witwer is a wonderful actor and hes so charming so im having a lot of fun playing with him
5497777 my part as this character has not been anything secure
5497778 so weve really been able to work in quite an equal partnership the writers myself and the fans in shaping who this character is going to be and shaping the direction she is going to go so i really like the fact that everything is new and that were really molding a brand new character together
5497779 what an amazing honor to have a character written after you
5497780 i think that its so cool so i am thrilled at that opportunity and that possibility and i hope to see it come to fruition i mean who gets to show their kids like this is me this is a character i built and thats awesome
5497781 were like a train we just keep going forging ahead and we miss them dearly and we love them and we talk about them and think about them all the time but you know we are making a show so we cant slow down
5497782 well see that bald head again hes not gone for good
5497783 john glover said to me once that a good part is a good part no matter what the venue and i go where the good parts are
5497784 ive always had so much respect for him and his career and his choices as an actor i think hes just amazing so i would like to stay doing that and really listen to him and follow in his footsteps in that respect
5497785 women are at the top of the list with what keeps me alive and young and i dont hang around with old people everybody that i know is at least 10 or 20 years younger than i am my wife annie is 24 years younger than i am
5497786 my oldest daughter once said dad how come you dont hang around with women your own age and i said listen women my age are usually a lot older than me
5497787 part of the secret to staying young is dont hang around with people your own age because youll get old with them hang out with the young people and youll stay young
5497788 i discovered that life begins at 60 the reason is by the time you get to be 60 you just dont care what happens youve done it all and you suddenly feel free about everything

5497791 sound marriages can be hard to recover after great time and distance have separated a husband and wife we are different people when we reunite
5497792 but my marriages collapse was attributable to my own selfishness and immaturity more than it was to vietnam and i cannot escape blame by pointing a finger at the war the blame was entirely mine

5497847 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5497848 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5497849 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5497850 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority

5497861 i can tell you after talking to marian it made him feel really good the way they shared everything with him about the team and the future i thought it was a smart move on their behalf it was a very beneficial thing they did
5497862 i dont know anything about that ive had no conversations with any team is russia about gaborik
5497863 marian has a year left on his contract with the wild and hes working hard and feeling good he says hes coming to camp in the best shape hes ever been in

5497878 to estimate to fly our helicopter for one hour is between 35 hundred and five thousand dollars that includes the salaries for the crew all the crew thats involved with taking the helicopter outside maintaining it flying it and also the fuel costs and the maintenance costs
5497879 unfortunately there wont be any repercussions unless its court ordered and then if it is court ordered it would be a case of whether this person has the resources to even pay for an operation like this
5497880 although this morning turned out to not be one of those cases where someone had drowned or needed to be rescued were there and were able to respond
5497881 regardless of what the situation may be prior to the incident if theres someone who is in distress its our job to go out and save that person if we can find them

5497901 we have made the necessary calls to make sure we have whatever resources that are required based on the damage done

5497903 despite continuing global economic uncertainty the outlook for the group remains favourable supported by good order intake
5497904 a serra de cantel es realmente para quem sabe ver e estudar uma maravilha
5497905 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5497906 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5497907 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5497908 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5497909 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5497910 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5497911 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5497912 if you dont succeed try again dont give up so easily
5497913 we have seen at first hand how people who were our neighbours in west yorkshire became involved in violent extremism resulting in terrible loss of life on 7 july 2005 we need to do more to stop people from taking those first steps into the world of violent extremism
5497914 if you carry a knife you are now more likely to get caught more likely to be prosecuted and more likely to go to prison if found guilty the tragic deaths of conor black in manchester and nilanthan murddi in croydon show why the action programme is so important
5497915 no one wants to see the devastation i saw my friend and the family go through it is something that as footballers and people and as a team we can get involved in
5497916 i will never forget the day the headmaster brought the school to a halt and said stephen was killed the night before something like that really does hit home one day he is enjoying life talking about doing an art a level and the next day he is gone
5497917 we need to change the way young people think about knives we need families and communities working together and we need influential role models
5497918 the coach was coming down a steep hill towards the bridge and from what i can see that coach has not managed to go round the bend has careered through a wall and down into a garden
5497919 i heard this massive crash and rumble crunching metal it sounded like a thunderstorm but then we heard shouts and screams
5497920 when i got to the scene there was a coach overturned there were many walking wounded being seen to by ambulance staff and half a dozen with head wounds
5497921 the coach had ploughed through a garden and two cars parked on a driveway one of them was bouncing down the road the other must have flown along with the coach
5497922 its an extremely dangerous road it is an old road and because buses and coaches are so wide now the road cannot cope with them there has been talk of a bypass for the village for the past 25 years and nothing has been done about it
5497923 its mayhem absolute mayhem we had a torrential downpour just before it happened
5497924 i was in the pub when someone came in screaming for blankets and sheets we went to help but the area had been cordoned off by police i was told his brakes must have failed
5497925 i heard what i thought sounded like thunder and the next thing i knew my front door was being banged on
5497926 there were 12 or 15 young people standing there crying and with blood running down them they said there had been an accident they couldnt really speak english
5497927 i rang 999 and went outside i was astonished to see a double decker coach it had dropped through my neighbours garden it must have fallen about 15 feet and had rolled over all these people were crying i ran out with some towels and blankets it was chaos were all very upset
5497928 someone who has preached peace and opposed the men of violence
5497929 one who is not taking part in the battle nor has the sheer intention to die is in the branch of hypocrisy
5497930 i dont want to be a person like it has been mentioned about i dont want to be deprived of the huge amounts or lessons allah has prepared for the believers in the hereafter
5497931 they are a decent family and having spoke to them i know they are shocked and bewildered at how one of their family members a 15 year old child at the time could have been mixed up in something like this it is an obvious tragedy for the family and i know they are finding this very hard to come to terms with
5497932 muslim parents need to learn the lessons of this case and be more alert vigilant and aware of what their children are doing as well as giving them a sound understanding of islam
5497933 cell one to stake out a target cell two to buy the equipment cell three to carry out the attack
5497934 national and international links to people convicted or about to stand trial on terrorism charges
5497935 let there be no doubt these are dangerous individuals these men were not simply in possession of material which expressed extremist views they were also in possession of material that was operationally useful to anyone wishing to carry out an act of violence or terrorism
5497936 sought to incite others for terrorist purposes promoting ideology and training programmes
5497937 a minicab pulled up and there was a guy in the back who was really drunk who started shouting you fucking paki
5497938 our friends were there and said look mate we dont want any problems just go away because youre being racist then the same guy came back and walked towards nilanthan and threw a punch he must have had a blade in his hand because he ended up with a slashed throat
5497939 it was a little blade but blood just went everywhere i took my shirt off to help and it was soaked right through
5497940 words cant express how i feel right now my brother is gone but every day every second we will be thinking of him he was energetic always giving a helping hand whenever it was needed my father cannot accept his only son is dead he keeps repeating the words hes gone over and over again
5497941 rip nilz ill never forget your cheeky attitude always cracking jokes with everyone my heart goes out to your family may god keep them strong and help them through this tough time hopefully justice will be served to the animal that took you away
5497942 i am very concerned about community reactions because of the different races involved it is very shocking
5497943 people used to genuinely fear that they would lose their jobs if they were outed and many did
5497944 if you were found out it was absolutely the end
5497945 the trick is to present the business case to corporate employers
5497946 it simply doesnt make good business sense to have a reputation for being a workplace that is not open to gay and lesbian employers graduates who were out and proud at university are simply not willing to hide away once they get into the workforce theyll simply take their skills to another company
5497947 i think whats really interesting about our corporate approach in the past three years is the sheer variety of companies we have attracted
5497948 many of them are not the usual suspects you would have signing up and i think what we did with mi5 is an example of that these are very counter intuitive organisations even though the ban on recruiting gay spies was lifted more than a decade ago the message had trouble sinking in
5497949 but mi5 is so focused on recruiting the very best talent that they realised it was critically important to hire staff from all walks of life
5497950 i think once id fully come out i knew i couldnt go back in
5497951 ive been at kpmg for more than 23 years now and it is a completely different place to what it used to be
5497952 if there is a war of talent going on then why on earth would you want to put people off who are gay or black or female it simply doesnt make business sense and i think clients want to see a diverse workforce
5497953 groups like stonewall were originally set up to change the law and they did we have thing like the equalities bill and civil partnerships but changing a law doesnt change a persons behaviour and that is what they are trying to do with the corporate sector
5497954 what we have is legal equality in theory but that does not necessarily eliminate the discrimination that continues to exist
5497955 those companies that have positive employment practices do it precisely because it signifies modernity
5497956 its cutting edge and glamorous theres still lots to do but when i look back we have come miles and miles

5497960 i was just shaking and and then also immediately i had to go into
5497961 immediately made those appointments and immediately called around for someone to start teaching me how to live macrobiotically
5497962 absolutely 100 percent clear and clean it did not spread they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer
5497963 i was just shaking and and then also immediately i had to go into
5497964 immediately made those appointments and immediately called around for someone to start teaching me how to live macrobiotically
5497965 it is very pleasing and slightly surreal to be able to announce record half year results when the financial markets are in turmoil
5497966 frustrated vendors have been placing their property in the market to let as they have been unable to agree sales due to a lack of demand
5497967 rental expectations fell slightly with some surveyors expecting oversupply to push rents down in the next quarter
5497968 demand for family homes remains stronger than for flats many would be buyers have been forced to rent as the route to mortgage finance has been blocked a total of 43 more chartered surveyors reported a rise than a fall in demand for houses compared to 34 of chartered surveyors who reported a rise in demand for flats
5497969 landlords are in it for the long term rather than to make a quick buck some 13 of landlords own 74 of buy to let properties these are large scale professional investors who provide considerable stability to the market
5497970 on the one hand you have the professional landlord and portfolio property investor who is thriving buying properties at a discount and able to tolerate falling yields in the short to medium term on the other hand you have amateur landlords who are struggling to make ends meet as rents fall and mortgage repayments rise

5497979 im being more aggressive im seeing the ball a lot longer
5497980 working with lenny in the cage we are doing different types of t drills he flips me some thick softballs
5497981 we have been doing a lot of different things and i think thats where it all comes from i like to give lenny his credit he deserves it it has been a tough year for him he has gotten me in a better hitting position i owe him that
5497982 its not up to you whether you play or not
5497983 if they want to label me a utility player thats fine but in my heart im an everyday player if you find any utility player happy with being a utility player something is wrong with that player
5497984 if thats how people on the outside want to label me thats fine because the people that are doing the labeling dont know me
5497985 when i say none of them know me its because none of them know whats inside my heart and the desire that i have
5497986 its hard because life goes on for us it goes on for everybody but i just dont want to forget i just like to remind myself and take a second and think about him
5497987 he came over to oakland and immediately we hit it off
5497988 they actually named him trevor but i think joe convinced jami to give the dog to us
5497989 other than family hes the closest person to me thats ever passed away and it was the most shocking
5497990 it still doesnt seem right he was just getting his life started he had his boy and his wife was pregnant at the time its still very hard and i think about him all the time i obviously feel for his wife and kids im still close to the family id like to at least somewhat be a part of his kids life
5497991 whether a game goes good and i go eight scoreless or a game goes bad and i give up five runs in five innings i just dont want to take things for granted
5497992 so at the end of the game whether it was good or bad when i take off my spikes i want to remember him
5497993 i dont want to take for granted what ive accomplished the friends that i have the family that i have
5497994 i want to remind myself that baseball means a lot and we go out there every day and try to win with all our hearts but when its all said and done its all about our families and our friends and thats the stuff thats important
5497995 we are prepared to do our part to help facilitate our local community
5497996 there are people in need that may not have a means of getting the water necessary to be properly prepared we have several delivery teams standing by and we will continue to deliver for as long as we safely are able to do so the other option for purchasing the waterbob will be to come by our corporate offices until at least midnight tonight the product will continue to be available through tomorrow weather permitting
5497997 what differentiates this is you have over 300 cameras in one central system thats available to anyone anywhere thats authorized
5497998 its being used to try to provide additional security proactively
5497999 conceptually it is part of the evidentiary process that would allow us to establish what crime occurred who did it and what action is appropriate
5498000 any functions that youd have in the office youd have in the car
5498001 it has not been developed as an open architecture because of the security requirements
5498002 increasingly video surveillance is becoming pervasive its being connected to central locations
5498003 before allocating funds or embarking on any major new initiative
5498004 video surveillance systems in the u s show little to no positive impact on crime
5498005 the surveillance cameras are virtually worthless as a crime fighting device

5498021 a triumph fluid original clever glitteringly vivid funny all the conventional pieties and forms of indian immigrant identity and trauma are so wittily preempted and yet theres a sure grasp at the serious core of the novel of the deep reverberations of politics and history i couldnt bear it when it ended
5498022 this is an outstanding piece of writing rich vivid fluent and well paced with a wonderful cast of well developed engaging characters and a constantly surprising story line

5498062 there is a trick or two to writing a 300 page book and typesetting it in two days one is to have two people work on the book and the other is to require only one word per page and that is what miekal and and i did on june 29th and 30th in west lima wisconsin we wrote a book of 300 collaborative pwoermds certainly the longest book of pwoermds ever and to my knowledge the only collaborative pwoermds ever made the pwoermd is a queer little literary beast one that combines the art of neologism with the practice of poetry the goal of the pwoermd is to provide the experience of a poem over the course of a single poem as a poetic form it is doomed to fail frequently but its size makes the attainment of perfection at least possible the way miekal and i created texistence worked one of us wrote fragments of two words on facing pages of a page layout on a computer and the other added letters in any way to those words and then wrote two partial words of his own occasionally i wrote a starter word of only two letters which miekal had to work hard to make into something and occasionally i wrote him a starter word so seemingly complete that he wasnt sure what he could add it was great fun we worked on this for hours at a time i usually was working on another writing project simultaneously and miekal would turn the computer towards me when it was my turn and i would turn it back to him when it was his turn

5498070 the way to find out about happiness is to keep your mind on those moments when you feel most happy when you are really happy

5498078 i am simply tired of these ridiculous names black women are giving their children
5498079 they put in apostrophes where none are needed they think a q is a must there was a time when shaniqua and tawanda were names you dreaded now if youre a black girl you hope you get a name as sensible as one of those
5498080 its so hard to keep coming up with something unique
5498081 hopefully we can see a lot more black children with sensible names like jake and connor

5498100 like miami tampa tried to use its adult business zoning laws to shut down a webcam filled house in this case occupied by women
5498101 but the appeals court ruling in the websites favor found that voyeurdorms customers werent gathering at the tampa home or anywhere else in tampa
5498102 why the miami herald ran the story now makes no sense
5498103 after all weve just filed for a summary judgment which we are expected to win and then the case will be settled in cocodorms favor

5498109 there is absolutely no flow right now in the buffalo river it is stagnant pools of water so theres really no water being generated here
5498110 not just this hurricane coming through were going to need weeks of rain were going to need a winter full of snow to recharge that ground water and like i said even more rain after that
5498111 everyone has to do their part to conserve water and use it wisely until we can break this drought cycle
5498112 they do have very differing points on many issues some i agree with barack obama on some i agree on john mccain
5498113 we didnt have any thing to indicate that the airport was in danger there was no threats to the airfield the plane went away but at the same time you want to be cautious you dont know what his motives were
5498114 has made certain statements that are inconsistent with printed copies of e mails that have been recovered
5498115 its been a couple of bad days of press for barack obama bio he might want to change the subject dramatically by announcing as early as tomorrow maybe his vice presidential pick that dominates the news cycle that gets his bad performance off the front pages and gets the media focused on something else
5498116 you have taken your very first step towards learning how you can change your life just by saying yes
5498117 because he has acknowledged he lied i feel free to report
5498118 he said the n amp o was the paper that arrived on his doorstep every day the one read by friends of him and his wife elizabeth
5498119 he said hed never called before to complain or state his case given elizabeths health she has cancer he said it was especially important to him that the story not run in the n amp o

5498143 its hard to think of anything more foreign to the principles of the democratic party or the whole american experience than abortion
5498144 far from liberating women abortion has become a lucrative industry exploiting young women beyond anything ever imagined
5498145 these are questions that rest uneasily on the conscience of todays democratic party
5498146 we can choose to extend once again the mantle of protection to all members of the human family including the unborn
5498147 a conviction in the minds of people that their liberties are gifts of god
5498148 we need to take a hard look at the spending practices of the state and thats really where we need to start
5498149 i certainly want to make sure that in the end the choices and cuts that we need to make arent ultimately pushed down onto localities
5498150 for the last four or five years we have cut property taxes not increased and we certainly dont want to throw that burden on the property tax owners because property tax owners are overtaxed right now so its going to be a jungle
5498151 commitment to producing the works of william shakespeare and his contemporaries along with other classical theatre repertoire and the work of living playwrights

5498194 ignorance and obscurantism have never produced anything other than flocks of slaves for tyranny
5498195 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
5498196 still all you can see is a point of light nothing more nothing less you cant even tell how far away it is you can make a prediction nice scientific word there about what they are
5498197 wow lets give credit to where credit is due he was a little bit more than an artist philosopher now wasnt he lets take a closer look into the life of ernst haeckel that you casually tossed aside or purposely omitted ive noticed you like to do that must be why you dont like cut and paste to many hard truths back on point ernst haeckel was an eminent german biologist naturalist philosopher physician professor and artist who discovered described and named thousands of new species mapped a genealogical tree relating all life forms and coined many terms in biology including phylum phylogeny ecology and the kingdom protista he was thrown out of his university for fraud it was his pictures of early similar life forms that he made up he knew they were wrong and presented them any way it was years before he was caught and yes prominent evolutionists still use his work today mostly because they dont know any better
5498198 well i expect to find accurate drawings in a museum if there going to display his work they need to put a disclaimer saying fraud yes you would agree right
5498199 there in brand new biology books look into it or is it you need fraudulent proof to carry your belief forward
5498200 ill agree with you on this what i disagree with is making models life scenes pretty pictures and animation of ape like people when you only have a piece of hip bone a tooth or in one instance they only had a single tooth and that was from a pig nice
5498201 oh there we go omitting the parts we dont like again maybe you should have cut and pasted this one here you go oh heres your link to oxford dictionary
5498202 lets see god created the heavens and the earth that tells me the god made the heavens and the earth are you following the earth ok now god moved upon the face of the waters waters god made the earth then moved over the waters on the earth did you get it that time i know its hard to understand what with you omitting so much of your quotes and all but i think thats pretty clear
5498203 are you sure about that ill give you a little more time
5498204 i think you need to shutup about straw man arguments coal needs to be rapidly buried in sediments and you need a heat source your argument is just assinine surprise surprise
5498205 have you ever noticed the scarcity of trees in peat bogs rainforests dont grow in peat bogs
5498206 have you ever noticed that coal is always found in seams you have peat for brains
5498207 a perfect vacuum with a gaseous pressure of absolute zero is a philosophical concept that is never observed in practice theres all kind of thing out there that shouldnt be like dust micro meteorites i believe he was referring gravitational forces cosmic rays gamma busts all kind of things that can distort light oohhh oohh dont forget dark matter you know that stuff that exists that we cant prove see or detect
5498208 dont forget dark matter you know the stuff that exists that we cant prove see or detect
5498209 the stuff that exists that we cant prove see or detect
5498210 all stars are the same intrinsic luminosity so apparent brightness is simply related to distance
5498211 well i expect to find accurate drawings in a museum if there going to display his work they need to put a disclaimer saying fraud yes you would agree right
5498212 lets see god created the heavens and the earth that tells me the god made the heavens and the earth are you following the earth ok now god moved upon the face of the waters waters god made the earth then moved over the waters on the earth did you get it that time i know its hard to understand what with you omitting so much of your quotes and all but i think thats pretty clear
5498213 the stuff that exists that we cant prove see or detect
5498214 all stars are the same intrinsic luminosity so apparent brightness is simply related to distance
5498215 you know as well as i do thats not what there in a museum for that comment shows your true nature and religious beliefs for evolution your willing to prop up a lie and call it truth that is why so many people are leaving darwinism
5498216 you nearly agree and then you agree is that like you voted against the war before you voted for it you know very well ernst haeckel made those drawings deliberately to mislead people along with piltdown man and every other transitional fossil thats why there are none you just believe a lie and will do anything to prop it up and thats sad
5498217 biology the living science hardcover publisher pearson prentice hall january 1998 language english isbn 10 0134155637 isbn 13 978 0134342351 product dimensions 11 x 8 6 x 1 8 inches shipping weight 5 1 pounds first published in 98 college level biology book in use today with ernst haeckel charts again you guys have to prop up lies as truth
5498218 lets see god created the heavens and the earth that tells me the god made the heavens and the earth are you following the earth ok now god moved upon the face of the waters waters god made the earth then moved over the waters on the earth did you get it that time i know its hard to understand what with you omitting so much of your quotes and all but i think thats pretty clear
5498219 this has been answered and makes you look fecicious the lord didnt tell us exactly when he made copper but their it is this is really a straw man argument and you know it
5498220 cant answer it can you theres no way out of that one
5498221 theres all kind of thing out there that shouldnt be like dust micro meteorites that seems to put it in practice
5498222 god is so easy to prove its sad its only when personal beliefs a religion like evolution gets in the way
5498223 see 7 wonders of mount st helens here is a brief quote regarding coal dr steven austin wrote his doctoral dissertation at penn state university on a new model for coal formation based on his study of a coal field in kentucky while geologists have used a peat swamp model to explain coal formation for over 100 years austin argued that explanation doesnt fit because coal is coarsely textured like bark not finely textured like swamp peat swamp peat contains root material coal does not swamp peat rests on a layer of soil coal often rests on a rock layer no swamp peat has been found partly formed into coal
5498224 austin advanced a floating mat model that a watery catastrophe stripped away millions of acres of forest and tangled them into mats the mats floated on an ocean over kentucky bumping against one another and dropping their bark to the bottom subsequent volcanic activity provided heat and pressure the final ingredients used in laboratories to produce coal the result was rich seams of coal in kentucky and a ph d for austin
5498225 just ten months later mount st helens erupted dumping vast amounts of vegetation into spirit lake including a million logs dr austin found the logs on the lake stripped of their bark the bottom of the lake was strewn with up to three feet of bark mixed with other vegetation and sediment to this day the material remains as merely slowly decaying vegetation but if a catastrophe supplies the right amount of heat and pressure the material will quickly change to coal dr austins research indicates that the idea of coal formation requiring millions of years is highly questionable
5498226 to this day the material remains as merely slowly decaying vegetation
5498227 i take back what i said about you having peat for brains i was being unduly charitable
5498228 you can say what ever field it belongs in it belongd in the trash can this is exactly how i learned evolution in my nice little brain washing school im pretty sure im way older than you so you probably learned the same thing if i did talking to kids in school today say tell me there being taught the same thing cosmic all the way to micro if hovind was right about anything its this this is how its taught this is how its presented in the american school system set up by robert muller if you dont like it help change it
5498229 to this day the material remains as merely slowly decaying vegetation but if a catastrophe supplies the right amount of heat and pressure the material will quickly change to coal dr austins research indicates that the idea of coal formation requiring millions of years is highly questionable
5498230 americans do not believe that humans evolved and the vast majority says that even if they evolved god guided the process just 13 percent say that god was not involved support for evolution is more heavily concentrated among those with more education and among those who attend religious services rarely or not at all
5498231 the bible is the actual word of god and it is to be taken literally word for word
5498232 i dont find estimating what could have happened during a time in which there was no recorded history to be actual science its speculation at best tell ya what we can create life right now why is it implausible that it could not have been created we know its possible because we can do it today
5498233 saying there was a monkey man millions of years ago that died off is pure speculation
5498234 i dont find estimating what could have happened during a time in which there was no recorded history to be actual science its speculation at best tell ya what we can create life right now why is it implausible that it could not have been created we know its possible because we can do it today
5498235 saying there was a monkey man millions of years ago that died off is pure speculation
5498236 to this day the material remains as merely slowly decaying vegetation but if a catastrophe supplies the right amount of heat and pressure the material will quickly change to coal dr austins research indicates that the idea of coal formation requiring millions of years is highly questionable
5498237 the flood deposited hundreds of feet of sediments rapidly and volcanic activity and compression provided the forces necessary for coal formation msh came close and as the quote implies all that would be needed is more volcanic activity and flood action to change 3 feet of bark into a coal seam you could wait till hell freezes over and you will never get coal from a peat bog if you have evidence to the contrary present it
5498238 its only a fallacy if the argument against the fallacy is a fallacy to begin with no proof theory and speculation theories arent facts lets see the monkey man frozen in ice otherwise youre just pulling crap from your backend to top that i never said anything about the bible did i further speculative assumptions wherein a man with no argument attempts to pick one from thin air har har har
5498239 its only a fallacy when the argument against the fallacy is a fallacy to begin with no proof theory and speculation theories arent facts lets see the monkey man frozen in ice otherwise youre just pulling crap from your backend to top that i never said anything about the bible did i further speculative assumptions wherein a man with no argument attempts to pick one from thin air har har har
5498240 support for evolution is more heavily concentrated among those with more education and among those who attend religious services rarely or not at all
5498241 by any measure the united states remains a highly religious nation compared to other developed countries
5498242 the bible is the actual word of god and it is to be taken literally word for word
5498243 guess youll have to start crying most people dont believe in evolution you guys even said it stopped all together for those who dream of a better life science has bad news this is the best it is going to get our species has reached its biological pinnacle and is no longer capable of changing that is the stark controversial view of a group of biologists who believe a western lifestyle now protects humanity from the forces that used to shape homo sapiens
5498244 if you want to know what utopia is like just look around this is it said professor steve jones of university college london who is to present his argument at a royal society edinburgh debate is evolution over
5498245 more scientists are taking this view every day thats why intelligent deseign is on the rise evolution keeps falling in on its self and darwin said he could be wrong if you dont find evidence in the fossil record whats it been over 150 years and not one fossil has been found that affirms evolution its nothing but a religion where man can break gods commandments andtry to live a guilt free life heres evolution in a nut shell
5498246 religion human beings relation to that which they regard as holy sacred spiritual or divine religion is commonly regarded as consisting of a persons relation to god or to gods or spirits worship is probably the most basic element of religion but moral conduct right belief and participation in religious institutions are generally also constituent elements of the religious life as practiced by believers and worshipers and as commanded by religious sages and scriptures
5498247 see your have no probs assuming things assumptions are speculative hey do you like the word when better issues of semantics aside ill quote one michael muir in saying are you offended oh im sorry maybe you need to be offended heres my apology

5498249 frustrated vendors have been placing their property in the market to let as they have been unable to agree sales due to a lack of demand in the housing market
5498250 many would be buyers have been forced to rent as the route to mortgage finance has been blocked
5498251 established investors have been reaping the benefits of the housing downturn for sometime and will continue to do so in the short term
5498252 however ever increasing supply could have an impact on rental growth as tenant options increase
5498253 a major factor in recent weeks is that many unsold houses are being withdrawn from sale and offered for rental instead
5498254 there is an oversupply of rental property in the market due to property owners unable to sell their properties attempting to let them
5498255 predict whether the 2008 congress will break the record number of jewish legislators that was established in the 2006 election cycle
5498256 conduct that may be penalized under the tra and or prohibited under the ear includes
5498257 the us government is strongly opposed to restrictive trade practices or boycotts targeted at israel
5498258 the commerce department is closely monitoring efforts that appear to be made to reinvigorate the arab boycott of israel and will use all of its resources to vigorously enforce us anti boycott regulations
5498259 yes of course the boycott is still in place and is still enforced
5498260 if a product contained even some components that were made in israel and you wanted to import it to dubai it would be a problem
5498261 is used by customs to confirm the country of origin and needs to be seen by the office which ensures any trade boycotts are enforced
5498262 failed to report in a timely manner its receipts of requests from dubai
5498263 they have their boys in there its time to start putting ours in
5498264 cant go to war with iran without getting approval from congress
5498265 and then the astounding thing is when asked why she said the leadership in israel asked her to that was in the newspaper that was in the washington post that she was asked by aipac and others not to do that
5498266 the fear of the lord is the beginning of knowledge
5498267 a feeling of deep respect mixed with wonder and awe and love
5498268 let us run with endurance or perseverance the race god has set marked out before us
5498269 at the end i realized i was thoroughly cooked but
5498270 i can do all things through christ who strengthens me
5498271 far be it from you lord this shall not happen to you
5498272 get behind me satan you are an offense to me for you are not mindful of the things of god but the things of men
5498273 if anyone desires to come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me
5498274 for what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world and loses his own soul
5498275 for the son of man will come in the glory of his father with his angels and then he will reward each according to his works
5498276 assuredly i say to you there are some standing here who shall not taste death till they see the son of man coming in his kingdom
5498277 one of the biggest mistakes we make is to believe there is only one way there are many diverse paths leading to god
5498278 god has chosen the foolish things of the world to shame the wise and god has chosen the weak things of the world to shame the things which are strong 28and the base things of the world and the despised god has chosen the things that are not so that he may nullify the things that are 29so that no man may boast before god
5498279 god has chosen the foolish things of the world to shame the wise
5498280 and god has chosen the weak things of the world to shame the things which are strong
5498281 the things that are not so that he may nullify the things that are
5498282 if god loves the world why does he allow innocent people to suffer
5498283 satan the god of this evil world has blinded the minds of those who don believe so they are unable to see the glorious light of the good news that is shinning upon them they dont understand the message we preach about the glory of christ who is the exact likeness of god
5498284 be careful watch out for attacks from the devil your great enemy he prowls around like a raring lion looking for some victim to devour take a firm stand against him and be strong in your faith remember that christians all over the world are going through the same kind of suffering you are

5498286 in the end of the sabbath as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week came mary magdalene and the other mary to see the sepulchre v 2 and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of the lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone from the door and sat upon it v 3 his countenance was like lightning and his raiment white as snow v 4 and for fear of him the keepers did shake and became as dead men v 5 and the angel answered ans said unto the women fear not ye for i know that ye seek jesus which was crucified v 6 he is not here for he is risen as he said come see the place where the lord lay v 7 and go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead and behold he goeth before you into galilee there shall ye see him lo i have told you v 8 and they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy and did run to bring the disciples word
5498287 i passed on to you what was most important and what has also been passed on to me christ died for our sins just as the scriptures said v 4 he was buried and he was raised from the dead on the third day as the scriptures said v 5 he was seen by peter and then by the twelve apostles v 6 after that he was seen by more than five hundred of his followers at one time most of whom are still alive though some have died by now v 7 then he was seen by james and later by all the apostles v 8 last of all i saw him too long after the others as though i had been born at the wrong time v 9 for i am the least of all the apostles and i am not worthy to be called an apostle after the way that i persecuted the church

5498302 social origins of the american corporate predator state jamie galbraith s recent book describes modern bush cheney republicanism as creating a predator state its predatory aspects are starkly visible in the gangs of corporate lobbyists who roam washington dc the halliburton iraq war procurement scandal and the corruption and incompetence that surrounded the hurricane katrina relief effort however the broad concept of a predator state needs qualification as we are really talking of an american corporate predator state thus the predatory nature of contemporary us governance is quintessentially linked to corporations and it is also a uniquely american phenomenon kleptocratic predator states like mugabe s zimbabwe or mobutu s zaire in africa are fundamentally different there is no equivalent in europe and none in east asia where ruling elites have a sense of obligation to the nation even as they often enrich themselves illicitly nor too is there an equivalent in latin america because government there never reached an economic size proportional to that of government in the us

5498311 fear procurement profit permanent war and the american way pdf print e mail sunday 17 august 2008 when it comes to determining the true thrust and implication of world events the old adage is still valid follow the money the lust for long green is not the sole determinant of state policies of course for example there are also the psychosexual anxieties of blustering elites the soul corroding pathology of political ambition the ignorance and arrogance of the powerful and the privileged the herd instinct that can drive whole populations into self deluding frenzies of nationalistic fervor all kinds of factors in the mix but money is never not in the center of things

5498316 people may be attracted to those who have similar attitudes values and beliefs and even marry them at least in part on the basis of this similarity because attitudes are highly visible and salient characteristics and they are fundamental to the way people lead their lives
5498317 if it wasnt for programs like this right now i dont know what i would do for my family
5498318 money is really tight in our household but to be able to come here and have this opportunity is really cool
5498319 i would have been struggling throughout this whole year to try and not use my notebook as much and try to keep my folders intact and stuff like that
5498320 gas prices and food costs have gone sky high you know even a loaf of bread has almost doubled and you know with everything going up like that even a notebook a set of pencils anything like that is a help
5498321 if you dont have anything nice to say dont say anything at all

5498325 i heard that theres freedom of religion in china so why is there a problem for us to bring bibles
5498326 we are waiting for them to come back with the law in english
5498327 we dont want to go without taking those books it cost us a lot of money to bring them here
5498328 theyre saying that its illegal to bring the bibles in and that if we wanted to we had to apply ahead of time for permission
5498329 and the rangers stream out of their cabins they are the hunters we are the rabbits and maybe we dont wanna be found maybe we dont want you tracking us down
5498330 we have seen at first hand how people who were our neighbours in west yorkshire became involved in violent extremism resulting in terrible loss of life on 7 july 2005 we need to do more to stop people from taking those first steps into the world of violent extremism
5498331 i think it is a lovely and beautiful film and i was very distressed at some of the comments from people determined to put this film down because it wasnt about dysfunctional pathologies
5498332 it was a celebration and minghella absolutely correctly interpreted the nature of botswana and reflected the whole thing
5498333 i was terribly upset when i saw what the critics said but people will be perverse
5498334 unfortunately the schedule overlaps with another film simon is already committed to
5498335 this really is a completely unsupportable government and i look forward to it being overthrown as much as i looked forward to saddam hussein being overthrown
5498336 i may be doing something for hbo soon with justin theroux who co wrote tropic thunder
5498337 at the outset you may be wondering why i have used the words claiming to be the head of state
5498338 now only his hand picked and compliant judges remain willing to validate whatever he demands and all this is also contrary to an express and earlier order passed by the supreme court on 3 november 2007
5498339 our findings provide the first evidence of mirror self recognition in a non mammalian species
5498340 they suggest that essential components of human self recognition have evolved independently in different vertebrate classes with a separate evolutionary history
5498341 a crucial step in the emergence of self recognition is the understanding that ones own mirror reflection does not represent another individual but oneself
5498342 mirror self recognition has been shown in apes and recently in dolphins and elephants using the mark test we obtained evidence for mirror self recognition in the european magpie pica pica this finding shows that elaborate cognitive skills arose independently in corvids the crow family and primates taxonomic groups with an evolutionary history that diverged about 300 million years ago
5498343 if you carry a knife you are now more likely to get caught more likely to be prosecuted and more likely to go to prison if found guilty the tragic deaths of conor black in manchester and nilanthan murddi in croydon show why the action programme is so important
5498344 no one wants to see the devastation i saw my friend and the family go through it is something that as footballers and people and as a team we can get involved in
5498345 i will never forget the day the headmaster brought the school to a halt and said stephen was killed the night before something like that really does hit home one day he is enjoying life talking about doing an art a level and the next day he is gone
5498346 we need to change the way young people think about knives we need families and communities working together and we need influential role models
5498347 a minicab pulled up and there was a guy in the back who was really drunk who started shouting you fucking paki
5498348 our friends were there and said look mate we dont want any problems just go away because youre being racist then the same guy came back and walked towards nilanthan and threw a punch he must have had a blade in his hand because he ended up with a slashed throat
5498349 it was a little blade but blood just went everywhere i took my shirt off to help and it was soaked right through
5498350 words cant express how i feel right now my brother is gone but every day every second we will be thinking of him he was energetic always giving a helping hand whenever it was needed my father cannot accept his only son is dead he keeps repeating the words hes gone over and over again
5498351 rip nilz ill never forget your cheeky attitude always cracking jokes with everyone my heart goes out to your family may god keep them strong and help them through this tough time hopefully justice will be served to the animal that took you away
5498352 i am very concerned about community reactions because of the different races involved it is very shocking
5498353 we are delighted that the british public has voted enid blyton its best loved author her storytelling is timeless and this result confirms that her books are still a firm favourite today
5498354 what makes blyton so successful is her imaginative exciting and magical style her writing has sent countless young readers on thrilling adventures and we hope that new generations will continue to enjoy her enchanting stories
5498355 he would not withdraw unless the pain was intolerable and there was no other way out
5498356 we cannot accept that liu xiang quits liu xiang dispels the passion of chinese people
5498357 i really thought that liu xiang could take less time to engage in advertisement and spend more time in training
5498358 on wednesday last week keepers noticed that claudio was very lethargic he hardly had anything to drink on friday and simply grew weaker and weaker he died on saturday
5498359 we cannot keep on taking away children from a mother
5498360 just over halfway through the beijing games and team gb has put in one of its best ever performances
5498361 in september our paralympians will i hope return from beijing having achieved similar success so to reflect the excitement and pride of the country in our athletes superb victories weve set a date in the diary now when we can cheer all our heroes and honour their extraordinary feats at this summers games
5498362 fitting tribute to the outstanding achievements of the whole team
5498363 evidence was put before the director of public prosecutions last night and the decision was taken to charge two men a 17 year old and a 20 year old
5498364 it is not so much about the numbers game as far as the uk is concerned most of the additional numbers will come from the us the issue is to provide as much security as possible for our troops and that is the reason for this helicopter initiative
5498365 may i suggest if there are five blokes to every girl we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa
5498366 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face
5498367 whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness some in other places in australia need to proceed to mount isa where happiness awaits really beauty is only skin deep isnt there a fairytale about an ugly duckling that evolves into a beautiful swan
5498368 hes actually returning us to the dark ages and making the guys that live in this town seem like sex starved men that will pounce upon the first girl they see
5498369 it paints the women here as second rate and suggests the men will settle for anything
5498370 theres a lot of anger among the community at the moment a lot of passionate anger
5498371 the coach was coming down a steep hill towards the bridge and from what i can see that coach has not managed to go round the bend has careered through a wall and down into a garden
5498372 i heard this massive crash and rumble crunching metal it sounded like a thunderstorm but then we heard shouts and screams
5498373 when i got to the scene there was a coach overturned there were many walking wounded being seen to by ambulance staff and half a dozen with head wounds
5498374 the coach had ploughed through a garden and two cars parked on a driveway one of them was bouncing down the road the other must have flown along with the coach
5498375 its an extremely dangerous road it is an old road and because buses and coaches are so wide now the road cannot cope with them there has been talk of a bypass for the village for the past 25 years and nothing has been done about it
5498376 its mayhem absolute mayhem we had a torrential downpour just before it happened
5498377 i was in the pub when someone came in screaming for blankets and sheets we went to help but the area had been cordoned off by police i was told his brakes must have failed
5498378 i heard what i thought sounded like thunder and the next thing i knew my front door was being banged on
5498379 there were 12 or 15 young people standing there crying and with blood running down them they said there had been an accident they couldnt really speak english
5498380 i rang 999 and went outside i was astonished to see a double decker coach it had dropped through my neighbours garden it must have fallen about 15 feet and had rolled over all these people were crying i ran out with some towels and blankets it was chaos were all very upset
5498381 becky is still in beijing after the most incredible week of her life weve got to remember that shes only 19 of course there will be a lot of sponsors queuing up but her priority is family time and rest
5498382 i wouldnt accept anything that comes in the way of my swimming
5498383 it was a long year of disillusionment i realised that america britain and international forces in general lacked the power legitimacy and knowledge to transform iraq i left very doubtful about how much good britain could do
5498384 oh this is interesting someguyiveneverheardof com is reporting presumptive democratic nominee barack obama has lady parts obviously scurrilous and unfounded well examine it tonight in our special barack obamas vagina the october surprise in his pants
5498385 its the only way to find out whats really going on
5498386 hopefully the process is to spot things that would be grist for the funny mill
5498387 in some respects the heavier subjects are the ones that are most loaded with opportunity because they have the most potential energy so to delve into that gives you the largest combustion the most interest i dont mean for the audience i mean for us
5498388 would be very unpleasant for most people to watch its really a gathering of curmudgeons expressing frustration and upset and the rest of the day is spent trying to repress that through whatever creative devices we can find
5498389 they have used fringe scientists and fake experts to muddy scientific debates on global warming stem cell research evolution and other matters
5498390 someone who has preached peace and opposed the men of violence
5498391 one who is not taking part in the battle nor has the sheer intention to die is in the branch of hypocrisy
5498392 i dont want to be a person like it has been mentioned about i dont want to be deprived of the huge amounts or lessons allah has prepared for the believers in the hereafter
5498393 they are a decent family and having spoke to them i know they are shocked and bewildered at how one of their family members a 15 year old child at the time could have been mixed up in something like this it is an obvious tragedy for the family and i know they are finding this very hard to come to terms with
5498394 muslim parents need to learn the lessons of this case and be more alert vigilant and aware of what their children are doing as well as giving them a sound understanding of islam
5498395 cell one to stake out a target cell two to buy the equipment cell three to carry out the attack
5498396 national and international links to people convicted or about to stand trial on terrorism charges
5498397 let there be no doubt these are dangerous individuals these men were not simply in possession of material which expressed extremist views they were also in possession of material that was operationally useful to anyone wishing to carry out an act of violence or terrorism
5498398 sought to incite others for terrorist purposes promoting ideology and training programmes
5498399 employers ranging from law firms to multinational banks to major aid and development organisations confirmed that applicants with languages were at the very least viewed more favourably than those without
5498400 some stated categorically that they would not employ people who spoke only english for some companies the specific languages were immaterial they saw students with languages as much more flexible and adaptable more likely to appreciate the need for intercultural communication skills and more able to build relationships with counterparts or clients in other countries
5498401 for the four most widely spoken community languages in england urdu cantonese punjabi and bengali there are no degree courses available despite the fact that these languages have been well established in the uk since at least the 1960s and that substantial numbers of secondary school children have studied them to a level
5498402 the dominance of english around the world may be threatened
5498403 furthermore other foreign languages notably arabic hindi urdu and spanish closely followed by russian and portuguese are strong competitors
5498404 in a world where everyone in reality probably about 25 per cent of the worlds population speaks english as a first or additional language competence in these other languages is likely to constitute a competitive edge
5498405 getting an education on the net at my age see you can teach a old dog new tricks
5498406 people used to genuinely fear that they would lose their jobs if they were outed and many did
5498407 if you were found out it was absolutely the end
5498408 the trick is to present the business case to corporate employers
5498409 it simply doesnt make good business sense to have a reputation for being a workplace that is not open to gay and lesbian employers graduates who were out and proud at university are simply not willing to hide away once they get into the workforce theyll simply take their skills to another company
5498410 i think whats really interesting about our corporate approach in the past three years is the sheer variety of companies we have attracted
5498411 many of them are not the usual suspects you would have signing up and i think what we did with mi5 is an example of that these are very counter intuitive organisations even though the ban on recruiting gay spies was lifted more than a decade ago the message had trouble sinking in
5498412 but mi5 is so focused on recruiting the very best talent that they realised it was critically important to hire staff from all walks of life
5498413 i think once id fully come out i knew i couldnt go back in
5498414 ive been at kpmg for more than 23 years now and it is a completely different place to what it used to be
5498415 if there is a war of talent going on then why on earth would you want to put people off who are gay or black or female it simply doesnt make business sense and i think clients want to see a diverse workforce
5498416 groups like stonewall were originally set up to change the law and they did we have thing like the equalities bill and civil partnerships but changing a law doesnt change a persons behaviour and that is what they are trying to do with the corporate sector
5498417 what we have is legal equality in theory but that does not necessarily eliminate the discrimination that continues to exist
5498418 those companies that have positive employment practices do it precisely because it signifies modernity
5498419 its cutting edge and glamorous theres still lots to do but when i look back we have come miles and miles
5498420 taxol works pretty well in the beginning 70 or 80 per cent of patients have a response but it fails in the end because drug resistance develops
5498421 in essence the technology can be used to overcome one of the most challenging types of problems of drug resistance this could potentially be used with any drug which is effective but has a delivery problem not just taxol
5498422 it is kind of like a bouncer if you are not recognised as being part of the club then you are kicked out
5498423 if we think of the pump as being a bouncer for the cellular club effectively what we are doing is disguising one of these therapeutic agents to get it in through the back door or the side door we are not even going to deal with the bouncer
5498424 nature has developed all of this firepower for getting things into cells and one of the ways is to create entities that are arginine rich
5498425 arginine rich sequences appear to figure in the mechanism by which many pathogens invade cells it is an exciting result to be able to take a drug known to work against cancer but stymied by resistant cells and restore it to effectiveness using an arginine transporter this bodes well for use with other drugs that succumb to resistance
5498426 i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5498427 whether i win or lose the nation will lose the honour and dignity of the country will be affected and the honour of the office of president will also be affected
5498428 i dont want anything from anybody i leave my future in the hands of the nation and people
5498429 today the shadow of dictatorship that has prevailed for long over this country that chapter has been closed
5498430 i am happy he has gone because he is a dictator
5498431 his arrogant style alarmed many thinking pakistanis they thought he was not an appropriate person to be head of state
5498432 friend to the united states and one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism

5498437 think for a moment about all the time money and effort that has been spent to stage the beijing games now think about the time money and effort that has been spent over the same time period to help the people of darfur now that chinas complicity in the darfur slaughter is known to all the world we invite you to help us keep the pressure on china to bring security to darfur

5498444 general quinn needs to see you in the briefing room he says its urgent
5498445 are you aware of an impending attack on planet earth
5498446 which would be brilliant obviously but i think this rather explains itself theyre right
5498447 the volcanic origin of the island makes being there an emotional interior journey
5498448 when i first visited lanzarote i found the landscape profoundly disturbing i had never seen colours so dramatically dark and i so fond of brilliant clashing colours was fascinated by the subtle obscurity of the place black had never formed part of my palette
5498449 the authorities here are not doing this because they like films but because they like money we will film their streets their people and export the image of the canaries making films is the best way to make money
5498450 the canaries have suffered a downturn in property prices in keeping with the rest of spain but the presence of almod var in lanzarote has already created a stir in terms of the amount of enquiries we are getting for properties
5498451 to us they are not the be all and end all because the viewers have already decided to be with us we have airtime available to make it easy for people to watch arts programming
5498452 i dont read press i dont go on the internet much im just not into it its like the lost art of keeping a secret but it keeps my tunes closer to me and other people
5498453 over the last year the unknown thing become an issue so im not into it any more im a low key person and i just want to make some tunes nothing else
5498454 my names will bevan im from south london im keeping my head down and just going to finish my next album
5498455 the mercurys have become an increasingly important showcase for new artists and esoteric music offerings enabling them to connect with a much wider audience
5498456 historically the lesser known and more leftfield acts tend to show the biggest pickups partly as their album sales start from a relatively low base but also due to the increased profile among mainstream music buyers that the nominations generate
5498457 that the shia doctrine of the imamate was contrary to the quran
5498458 accused the shia of believing that the quran has been corrupted
5498459 consistently associat ing the shia with the extremism of the wahhabi clergy in saudi arabia
5498460 although the iranian shiites are on the opposite side of the religious divide they have one thing in common with the saudis a priestly cast
5498461 roundly condemn the existence of a religious class of scholars as
5498462 at no point were shia religious scholars or academics presented with an opportunity to challenge these points
5498463 it oozes love both for the craft of film making and the subject
5498464 a stringent social critic of the finest order who always stood up for the underdog by exposing the hypocrisy of the middle class
5498465 his vision and his engagement with the reality of the period gave a direction not just in terms of content but also form
5498466 give me a piece of paper any paper and a pen and i shall write as naturally as the bird flies or a fish swims for the last 50 years i have been writing at roadside restaurants and on the crowded local trains i have written on the sick bed in the hospital in spite of the doctors advice it was a great relief it was joy
5498467 dont look so glum talby im not going to behead the papist traitor who seeks to dethrone me etc etc just yet you can take her back to your hovel for safe keeping instead
5498468 cecil may think you are plotting against the queen but i know you would never do that i must help you to marry norfolk so you can regain your scottish throne

5498471 for a long time people kind of got use to going to the doctors and filing a claim now its like we want the whole bill upfront
5498472 we are like any other business we have to collect our money to pay our bills its far easier to collect upfront than to go after someone on the back end
5498473 its reasonable to go an eye doctor on monday and then visit other doctors on wednesday and thursday and there will be an overpayment
5498474 i need someone to help me with housing and food for the children we cant cope with this by ourselves
5498475 we already have three girls she wanted a boy i told her because of our standard of life three are enough we were barely coping with three children
5498476 she might be able to suckle twins but not this many
5498477 there were offers from people as far away as kuwait and from the health ministry but nothing yet
5498478 they were the closest to us before the war and now they are the most frightening enemy
5498479 it feels like your own brother has cut off your head
5498480 after what happened it should be clear that they should have self determination
5498481 the reality is that for 15 years at least south ossetia and abkhazia have been independent in fact
5498482 its not true the goal of russia is peace in the caucasus
5498483 que se dane a onda fashion por isso mesmo deixo aqui meu manifesto
5498484 its going to be a different feel because were doing five days
5498485 its not going to change its not a family show were still going to be on after 9pm torchwoods a family show if you think its appropriate for your children to watch it we just deal with issues of life but no its not going to be toned down were still going to be edgy because thats what we are
5498486 gt dropped out to be in the doubtless crappy law and order uk but thats just me now what do you think
5498487 with all due respect to cardiff city theres only so many options in a place of that size for stories compared to a huge city like london

5498489 higher prices at the gasoline pump and higher food costs at the grocery store are placing a tremendous burden our single parent and working parent families this funding will help our most vulnerable families living from paycheck to paycheck
5498490 i have to applaud the governor for his leadership on this measure and for making lt lt home
5498491 balmoral has always been our beacon in our green work the royal household is constantly looking at new ways of saving and supplying energy so as to remain as environmentally friendly as possible well into the future
5498492 the powerful year round flow of water should generate about 1mw of electricity and runs like a miniature version of the massive scottish hydro plants that can produce 300mw of power these initiatives have been welcomed by environmental campaigners
5498493 we found that shorter slimmer females with long slender legs a curvy figure and larger breasts are more attractive
5498494 it is widely believed that human beings are attracted to one another as a result of their prospect as a mate who will yield higher quality offspring for the chooser
5498495 larger breasts are quite conspicuous and this is what males are attending to rather than symmetry
5498496 because bodily asymmetries are too subtle to be seen with the naked eye evolution has instead engineered more conspicuous signals and displays such as broad shoulders curvy waist lines or smooth dance moves to indicate mate quality
5498497 the 3d body scanner accurately extracts hundreds of measurements of the human body including volume in six seconds and removes a potential source of measurement error
5498498 this is the first study that shows the contribution of ships to fine particulates in the atmosphere
5498499 ships are really unregulated when it comes to air pollution standards what we wanted to find out was the contribution of ships to the air pollution in san diego
5498500 and what we found was a surprise because no one expected that the contribution from ships of solid sulphur rich particles called primary sulphate would be so high
5498501 our results suggest that this component of ship emissions is important and should not be ignored in the future
5498502 the market is closer to the actual outcome than the polls about 74 per cent of the time
5498503 recently an extreme form of linguistic determinism has been revived which claims that counting words are needed for children to develop concepts of numbers above three
5498504 however our study of aboriginal children suggests that we have an innate system for recognising and representing numerosities the number of objects in a set and that the lack of a number vocabulary should not prevent us from doing numerical tasks that do not require number words
5498505 do these two sets have the same number of objects
5498506 we found that warlpiri and anindilyakwa children performed as well as or better than the english speaking children on a range of tasks and on numerosities up to nine even though they lacked number words
5498507 we need to investigate ways in which we can add on to these building blocks to develop ways of teaching numeracy that are relevant to indigenous students culture
5498508 we also need to redefine the way we think about numeracy across the board moving away from the view that we need words to describe numbers and basic computations
5498509 we are almost certainly not going to be able to defend absolutely every bit of coast it would simply be an impossible task both in financial terms and engineering terms
5498510 this is the most difficult issue we are going to face as an agency we know the sea is eating away at the coast in quite a number of places primarily but not totally exclusively on the east and south coasts its a particularly huge issue in east anglia but in quite a number of other areas as well
5498511 chris smiths wide ranging speech must be taken seriously the government must listen to the concerns of the people of suffolk and the rest of the east coast we want managed defence not managed retreat this must not be the first government in history to abandon britain to the sea
5498512 coastal erosion is perhaps the most serious issue that faces the suffolk coastal constituency we have 74 miles of coastline and all of it is vulnerable
5498513 can make it difficult to walk up and down stairs or run hop jump or kick a ball

5498517 im actually taking guitar lessons from jay z right now and hes already taught me both chords to wonderwall in fact its so much fun having jay teach me all of noels songs on the guitar hooray that im thinking of doing an oasis jay z remix album like danger mouse s grey album potential titles are champagne superhova or definitely jay z ill keep you posted
5498518 an entire generation of developing world youth would be removed from the cockpit of religious fundamentalism presuming they dont make the hideous mistake of moving to the american bible belt and would be exposed to the irresistible distractions of sex drugs and rocknroll they would be won over forever to the light side of the force the enlightenment liberalism atheism sexual permissiveness punk rock disco dancing ice cream real ale books puppy dogs and all that good stuff

5498524 the most charitable description of the hold steady would be a glorified bar band with a tone deaf asshole shouting over the top they are essentially just nick hornby as a rock band

5498526 cecil may think you are plotting against the queen but i know you would never do that i must help you to marry norfolk so you can regain your scottish throne
5498527 the main difference between my informal education at home and my formal education at college has been that at home i can focus on what i want to learn when i want to learn it
5498528 there were never any lessons at home or anything structured for more than a couple of weeks
5498529 days go by in the same way that they would in the summer holidays for other children
5498530 one of my children might be outdoors with the chickens another may be looking after the pets and the third may be on the computer
5498531 the ease naturalness and immense intellectual potential of informal learning up to the age of middle secondary school means they can learn certainly as much if not more
5498532 doing nothing observing having conversations exploring and through self directed learning
5498533 its products are often intangible its processes obscure its progress piecemeal
5498534 there are false starts unrelated bits and pieces picked up interests followed and discarded sometimes to be taken up again sometimes not yet the chaotic nature of the informal curriculum does not appear to be a barrier to children organising it into a coherent body of knowledge
5498535 yet the lack of information quality control does not appear to lead to muddled confused children
5498536 in some ways it may be an advantage because rather than presenting knowledge in neat packages the informal curriculum forces learners to become actively engaged with their information to work with it move it around juggle ideas and resolve contradictions it is not a static thing contained in a series of educational folders it is alive and dynamic
5498537 i provide materials resources help with research discuss what they are reading and what i am reading watch documentaries with them have stimulating conversations listen a lot and answer questions
5498538 helping with the cooking and shopping and collecting supermarket trolley money
5498539 she came to appreciate the value of material goods but she did not see it like that
5498540 she saw only the concrete activity if she did sometimes count money or do sums in her head it was her decision sparked by her emerging understanding or simple curiosity about numbers
5498541 the point is that maths certainly most of what is acquired at the primary level can be learned as an integral part of everyday concrete activities in school maths has to be divorced from the dynamic realities of everyday life
5498542 there is no developmental or educational logic behind the radical change in pedagogy from informal to formal when children start school
5498543 the young people had the personal skills to make the transition with apparent ease
5498544 the curriculum opens up a number of ways we can understand it history science art maths its very important that we give all young people the opportunity to engage with all subjects whether they immediately occur to them or their parents or not schools have developed ways of condensing canons of literature for example and introducing it in sequence to children
5498545 its very important that parents have the option to home educate their children but i wouldnt advise it

5498550 general quinn needs to see you in the briefing room he says its urgent
5498551 are you aware of an impending attack on planet earth
5498552 which would be brilliant obviously but i think this rather explains itself theyre right
5498553 i felt a little stupid and embarrassed that i hadnt watched the show before
5498554 i think over the coming weeks well get cracking and discover what the answers to those questions are
5498555 naren and i spoke to each and every member of our cast and i have rarely seen them as excited
5498556 they just cant wait until mr fishburne gets on that set and they get to collaborate and act with him and be in the series with him
5498557 im happy to say that the episodes they sent to me were really really engaging and really wonderful and kind of dark and moody like the kind of work that ive been involved in
5498558 i love doing this i like doing it a lot
5498559 it is fiscally responsible for the city to take the lowest bid
5498560 we are supposed to award the contract to the lowest bidder
5498561 i dont want this vulnerable population to lose their jobs
5498562 i want to be morally responsible i dont want to lose my soul for a few dollars
5498563 if the city can give the contract to an organization that also provides the service we are looking for but also is working for disabled populations it is worth looking at
5498564 there is an element of social good to be considered here as well
5498565 these guys do a good job and it has nothing to do with the challenges they have
5498566 they also teach the public a lot they are part of the community like everyone else
5498567 the purpose of rohnert park services is to work on these behavior issues jobs provide incentive it is money they like what they do and it provides a service

5498571 hey the new coach of my baseball team the fearsome green sox is named mark quinn have you ever heard of him he said he once played in the majors
5498572 i love coaching kids im coaching two teams now a team of 13 year olds called the wranglers and then your kids team the green sox plus i give private hitting lessons i really do feel that its my job to give back to baseball what the game gave to me i tell the kids yeah i played big league baseball so ask me anything you want i will sit all night and talk baseball with kids i have a 10 year old brother so its like ive been coaching kids for a long time besides im just a big kid myself
5498573 i have a ton of baseball knowledge and experience itd be wasted if i didnt share it with kids
5498574 one of the kids i coach just got back from the baseball hall of fame in cooperstown they have a lot of memorabilia stores up there and he bought my autographed photo for 40
5498575 i was just messing around with my brother in the house something happened to my rib when it hit the arm rest of a chair i didnt even know that i cracked it until a couple of weeks later that was my first big injury it wouldnt be my last unfortunately
5498576 i still want to play and i definitely think i can make a team my dream is for the astros to invite me to camp next spring im a hometown guy i went to rice and i still can hit im still buddies with lance berkman ive kept myself in good shape i have no injuries at all now im only 34
5498577 there is no doubt in my mind that if i got a chance with the astros that i would make the team i just need them to give me a chance
5498578 freeing up the white spaces would enable innovators to blanket our nation with fast affordable internet access it would mean more competition much better prices and a host of cutting edge applications and devices

5498586 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5498587 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5498588 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5498589 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5498590 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5498591 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5498592 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5498593 provide companies much higher impact and effectiveness than anything they have so far via traditional advertising
5498594 brands would need multiple brand ambassadors addressing the many different target audiences making up their potential customer base

5498719 we were there to discuss house bill 1001 and circuit breaker
5498720 we wanted to start the dialogue whether we like it or not we cant operate in isolation with our budgets we cant do that anymore
5498721 obviously not all the effects of house bill 1001 are known at this time
5498722 its bill an 850 page document not all the effects of it have been determined yet as those determinations are made we have agreed to share information
5498723 in the past we operated in isolation but now with circuit breaker theres only so much revenue available and thats why its important that we work together and share information
5498724 the whole consensus here is we have to come together as a county
5498725 now we really need to come together and work together as a unit we will still have our own niches communities and our own things we have to do but well have to get smarter as to how we buy things maybe well buy as a group
5498726 we should have been doing this working together all along
5498727 we just need to tighten our belts but i dont think people will be satisfied with the services they receive

5498730 i think the new legislature that comes in will tweak this bill a little bit theres still a lot of unanswered questions
5498731 bear one anothers burdens and thus fulfill the law of christ
5498732 now i exhort you brethren by the name of our lord jesus christ that you all agree and that there be no divisions among you
5498733 diligent to preserve the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace
5498734 behold how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity
5498735 that they may all be one even as you father are in me and i in you that they also may be in us so that the world may believe that you sent me
5498736 even as you father are in me and i in you
5498737 the glory which you have given me i have given to them that they may be one just as we are one i in them and you in me that they may be perfected in unity so that the world may know that you sent me and loved them even as you have loved me
5498738 so as those who have been chosen of god holy and beloved put on a heart of compassion kindness humility gentleness and patience bearing with one another and forgiving each other whoever has a complaint against anyone just as the lord forgave you so also should you beyond all these things put on love which is the perfect bond of unity

5498771 the movement of any black widow from the vineyard to the market place presents an immediate concern to the table grape industry
5498772 before any treatments we recommend destroying nests to determine the efficacy of treatments
5498773 if the treatment is effective nests should not be rebuilt following treatment
5498774 we appreciate the generosity of fred franzia and the bronco wine company for establishing this position at fresno state

5498783 this grant is most timely and will help us expand our capacity to do research and train students in organic farming and sustainable agriculture
5498784 fresno states commitment to promoting sustainable and environmentally friendly farming practices in its campus farm
5498785 this provides us with a year round production facility for organic seedlings of various herbs and vegetables that we sell at the gibson farm market and plant on our farm
5498786 this summer we had limited production of organic bell peppers green beans and zucchini that were sold in the market

5498789 i hope the world has woken up to what is going on the russians should get out of my country
5498790 the worst thing the world could do would be to compromise and show weakness

5498807 when we unwrapped the baby to see her she realized it was moving i began screaming and ran with it toward the doctors he said
5498808 she was then rushed to the neonatal intensive care unit where doctors are fighting for her life

5498818 in the context of the demand challenges that the world will deliver the combination of bhp billiton and rio makes more sense than ever

5498821 although we think the term stagflation greatly exaggerates the pain in the us economy at least relative to the 1970s when it was initially coined it certainly describes the feel of the past weeks economic data

5498823 if this ceasefire clause on pre 7 august positions is not applied quickly and in its entirety i will convoke an extraordinary council of the european union to decide what consequences to draw
5498824 i expect a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia
5498825 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to
5498826 we will have to determine if the russian intervention against its georgian neighbour was a brutal and excessive response
5498827 in which case there will be inevitable consequences for its relations with the european union
5498828 i do not advise any knee jerk reaction such as suspending talks on a partnership and cooperation agreement with the eu
5498829 our interest in this is as great as russia itself talks in the nato russian council are essential too because we need open lines of communication
5498830 some of russias actions were not proportionate but it is rare that all the blame is on one side in fact both sides are probably to blame
5498831 we must stick to the partnership with russia even after these recent events which of course do not please us
5498832 its almost as if germany and russia had a meeting and said this is our territory and this is yours you can do what you like there

5498849 no estoy conforme con lo que hice pero s estoy muy alegre por mi panam y por toda am rica latina
5498850 en realidad esto es como el f tbol se gana 1 0 y se puede ser el campe n mundial

5498852 mi pr ximo objetivo es romper el r cord mundial para eso me voy a preparar con todo creo que necesito saltar 9 metros aunque con 8 96 estar a bien
5498853 si tu ganas una medlal de oro vas a ser tan querido y tan famoso como yo en panam
5498854 eso me motivo para m fue un orgullo que un dolo como l me diga eso
5498855 yo estaba un poco fuera de forma me faltaba ritmo pero igual estaba convencido de que ganaba una medalla
5498856 que disfrute saladino este a o porque el pr ximo a os se tienen que cuidar saladino y todos los dem s
5498857 creo que en el futbol el que hace los goles es el que merece ganar no y creo que nosotros por momentos cuando anotamos el gol comenzamos a controlar un poco mejor el partido pero ellos son un equipo que toca bastante bien que tiene mucha movilidad que estaba en su casa y que tuvo esas oportunidades para marcar
5498858 ya lo del penal para nosotros es bastante dudoso tambi n hubo una falta previa que no se marca a favor de cruz azul y ya no queda mas que olvidar eso nos quedamos contentos con el trabajo que hicimos y pensar ya en el siguiente partido hay que darle la importancia que se merece tambi n
5498859 hicimos un viaje tan largo para jugar un torneo dignamente pero desgraciadamente las decisiones arbitrales nos hacen que nos den la voltereta pero bueno tenemos un partido m s para mostrarnos
5498860 nos falt un poco m s de adaptaci n a la cancha y al bal n que es muy diferente con el que jugamos all en m xico es mucho m s

5498863 the allegation that i made an offer to stephen estcourt qc is simply untrue
5498864 presumably the position being referred to is that of solicitor general
5498865 it was never my intention to appoint mr estcourt to that position
5498866 i made no offer to mr estcourt i have had no contact with him whatsoever in connection with such an appointment
5498867 i have been interviewed by police in recent weeks and not once did they inform me i was the subject of any investigation
5498868 nor have i ever been informed about any specific allegations made against me by mr burch
5498869 in flagging moves late last week to give tasmania a truly independent police service the premier mr bartlett made the case himself for an independent probe into these grave allegations

5498880 would you tell me what you would have liked to get i might be able to spare you coming back today or at least be able to tell you when its worth while to call again so that you neednt make another way in vain
5498881 but i just got the book you ordered from the baker its in this parcel

5498886 i call her the queen because she is the greatest female triathlete weve ever seen
5498887 to win gold under that much pressure under that much expectation just shows you what a quality athlete she is
5498888 ill never forget when she knocked on my door and i saw this little tiny girl and i just thought my god whats here
5498889 but from the first day she trained she was just incredibly determined she just epitomises the classy athlete
5498890 on the third lap i started worrying that i had missed someone
5498891 i thought of watching loretta in athens you know thinking she didnt know thats really why i wanted to finish in a hurry
5498892 there are so many days in training where you are tired you are hurting you are in a world of pain
5498893 thats what i practise when it comes to race day its two hours thats far less worse than a days training
5498894 she really stuck it to us and seeing her out in front you never want to give up when you see someone trying that hard i love that she won gold
5498895 i thought it was better off hurdling the barricade than the car
5498896 shes just a tough little athlete she puts her heart and soul into training every day of her life i know everyone else does that but maybe she just puts in half a per cent extra
5498897 he taught me a lot of things through his misfortune in sydney and i think hes been very happy to put all his time and energy into helping me achieve this goal for both of us were a team
5498898 i thought i caught it in time yesterday during the game to be able to play today but it just continually got more and more stiff today its pretty stiff but ive had some good success with some contrast stuff so well try that today and see how it goes tomorrow
5498899 its been crazy its one of those things where it goes on for a couple of days and then goes away and i feel great and dont have any warnings yesterday the last batter that josh beckett faced he gave up that base hit and i went to back up ellsbury and about halfway over there i kind of felt it tighten up and i finished up that half inning well see hopefully its sooner vs later
5498900 like i said ive had an injury a long time ago in st louis and had some real bad flareups its pretty aggravating to miss some games with it i just kind of wish it would go away you get it feeling good and you dont think anything about it and then the next thing you know it kind of pops back up it almost feels like a little shock going up your back
5498901 i felt great coming into the season im trying to figure out something right now i couldnt even think about trying to pick up a bowling ball
5498902 well treat it today and see how it feels tomorrow
5498903 i definitely dont want to be laid up on a training table with ice on my back well try to get it better
5498904 hes close to being ready for us which is great
5498905 if you dont like the position you are in then play better

5498933 we think many of them are genes that evolved uniquely in salamanders to help with this process
5498934 genes are on average 5 to 10 times larger than those in other vertebrates
5498935 the region of the genome containing genes is estimated to be more than two gigabases which is as big as some entire genomes
5498936 if we come up with some totally unique gene only present in axolotl that would make it really hard to replicate
5498937 whats missing is how you coordinate a response to get an integrated structure

5498942 desperate times call for desperate measures and thats what were seeing from gm
5498943 its not a new theme but on the other hand the track record of gms incentive programs has been very good
5498944 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5498945 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5498946 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5498947 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority
5498948 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies

5498953 we were going to ignore the olympics but now were loading our cannons our weapons of mass distribution is pointed towards china
5498954 i also hope that the swedish government will report back to them and tell them to give us the gold that the ioc stole from the swedish wrestler and to tell them to not host the olympics in a country without any human rights

5498960 if wed called the game kill the terrorists we wouldnt have any problems but its politically sensitive and thats what this is about
5498961 youve got to ask yourself why do zavvi feel the need to protect their customers from a board game that is critical of war and violence when they have no problem pushing computer games that celebrate and reward brutal and aggressive behaviour

5498996 it can vary as much among top athletes as the rest of the population
5498997 the majority of people will need up to 500ml of fluid per hour after the first 45 minutes of intense activity
5498998 for those who are prone to getting dehydrated not taking a drink could be disastrous
5498999 if the average adult loses 3 4lb of fluid their performance is seriously impaired
5499000 if they lose 7lb which is possible in the heat they are likely to get cramps nausea and experience a 20 30 drop in endurance capacity
5499001 during intense or prolonged exercise the kidneys are unable to excrete fluid as efficiently as normal
5499002 in extreme cases water is retained especially in highly absorbent brain cells and the pressure causes the body to shut down its primary functions such as breathing and heart rate treatment involves a small volume of highly concentrated salt solution but it can be fatal
5499003 its surprising how little elite runners do drink they are able to run 26 2 miles at speed with very little fluid on board
5499004 a medicine that must be ingested to prevent heat illness and optimise sports performance i believe that the body is adapted for conditions of mild dehydration
5499005 we evolved from hunters we had to run and chase animals on the hot african plains we didnt have time to pause for a drink
5499006 physiologists developed an unproven hypothesis that to become even the slightest bit dehydrated during exercise would kill you the sports drinks industry then used this bad science to market their products
5499007 has yet to find a death from dehydration in the history of competitive running
5499008 you have shown that you are a very dangerous individual indeed i consider that you pose a very significant risk to the public and you are a dangerous offender

5499012 nobodys come up with a way to prevent this from happening even here in the u s
5499013 the u s is probably more internet dependent than any place in the world so to that extent were more vulnerable than any place in the world to this kind of attack
5499014 so much of what were doing in the united states is out there on the internet and all of that can be taken down at once
5499015 this is such a crucial issue at every level our security now is dependent on computers
5499016 its a whole new era political and military conflicts now will almost always have a cyber component the chief targets will be critical infrastructure and the attacks will emerge from within our own computer systems
5499017 it only takes a couple of experts it doesnt take a whole cyber infantry division to pull something like this off
5499018 for a very small investment in resources you can have a huge impact
5499019 when it comes to our government it security were pretty strong in protecting against attacks
5499020 we can command so much bandwidth that its hard to overwhelm our servers
5499021 we are vulnerable to more sophisticated attacks but right now most of the people who want to do us harm dont have those capabilities
5499022 youd see some disruption of essential services like electricity youd definitely see espionage
5499023 would it be decisive no nobodys going to win a conflict with the united states in cyberspace but would it be disruptive and irritating yes
5499024 its hard to see all those wires and tubes in him
5499025 we kept telling him to put the gun away to quit playing with it he was showing off and kept pulling the gun out of his pocket and it went off
5499026 if you carry a knife you are now more likely to get caught more likely to be prosecuted and more likely to go to prison if found guilty
5499027 no one wants to see the devastation i saw my friend and the family go through
5499028 you dont expect situations that are happening whereby people go to school in the morning and then you never see them again because of incidents that have happened we have got to help we have got a voice that kids listen to so it is important we get involved in something like this
5499029 i will never forget the day that the headmaster brought the school to a halt and said that stephen had been killed the night before it was a crazy atmosphere in school very sombre and chilling something like that really does hit home one day he is enjoying life talking about doing an art a level and the next day he is gone
5499030 in the past maybe there wasnt a strong enough deterrent for carrying knives if you go to prison now it will be a step in the right direction people need to know it is not always the person intending to hurt someone who gets injured people carrying the knives also get hurt
5499031 communities and youth centres also need to play a bigger part boredom can set in a lot of times there is a lot of peer pressure and then something happens that everyone regrets
5499032 im delighted the fa and the england team are supporting our campaign warning youngsters about the severe consequences of knife crime
5499033 you can only solve this by working together the england players are role models for this generation and i hope their messages have a positive impact
5499034 given her needs they felt they couldnt guarantee sams safety still i was absolutely gutted
5499035 the carers were nice but the activities on offer were totally inappropriate there was no progression it seemed more about keeping sam occupied than helping her move on
5499036 since i started the course i feel like a grown up person im an adult now not a baby
5499037 the frustrating thing is that after two years with us some of our young people do get to the point where they are ready to work
5499038 they need some support to get started perhaps for someone to work alongside them for a few weeks or months but there is no funding for that fast forward a few months and they can be back to square one
5499039 the funding dried up after a year and that was the end of that
5499040 unfortunately as a society weve developed low expectations of people with learning disabilities its not uncommon to see people with learning disabilities working in your local supermarket but thats not the only job they can do
5499041 they can be such a great asset they are highly motivated reliable have a positive attitude a good work ethic and can offer a good length of service
5499042 in our print shop they are creasing folding stapling packaging and stuffing envelopes in the cycle shop weve been able to train young adults with learning difficulties to do routine bike servicing dismantling lubricating reassembling the bikes
5499043 for those with learning disabilities a reasonable adjustment might be to offer a verbal application process and a trial period
5499044 some people think that im heartless putting my daughter into residential care but actually im giving her some independence moving her on
5499045 shes in a more stimulating environment she has friends shes been to see mamma mia had a caravan holiday gone bowling and learned circus skills shes learned to make her bed shes done ironing id never have been able to do that with her at home
5499046 what is important at this stage is that she is progressing becoming more independent and leading a full life which she has every right to do i realise we are lucky if we lived in a different part of the country it could have been a completely different story
5499047 sometimes i only have to think about something funny to collapse and sometimes it happens again just as im coming round because i think about the joke that made me fall over in the first place
5499048 once i tried to calculate how often it happened in one day but i lost count at 40
5499049 it first happened one day shortly after i went to university i was sitting in my kitchen my flatmate made me laugh and i hit the floor i could hear and see everything going on but i couldnt move a muscle
5499050 i had one patient who it happened to whenever he felt smug
5499051 im always laughing sometimes my mum and i dont even have to be talking about something funny to laugh
5499052 its always at the forefront of your mind because you constantly have to assess an area for danger is there glass around any sharp corners even having a cup of tea in your hand can be dangerous
5499053 i had to stop cycling and driving at one time i thought i might not be able to have a family because what kind of a mother would i be collapsing all the time then theres the embarrassment factor all of a sudden you can fall into your dinner or your drink starts pouring straight out of your mouth
5499054 im on new medication that started working three months ago
5499055 im constantly wrestling with the difficulty of getting sodium oxybate prescribed for patients
5499056 theres an incredibly elaborate procedure for every patient and the prescribing boards stall as long as they can every time i think theres a feeling that cataplexy is a condition that doesnt need a pricey drug
5499057 its not like youre in pain with it and because it happens when you laugh people think its funny
5499058 the first doctor said it was anxiety and the second said it was my blood sugar levels the third one sent me to a specialist but only because id found out what it was myself by looking up my symptoms on the internet
5499059 its almost certainly under recognised and it usually tends to get picked up first by the patient themselves rather than a doctor i see so many people who have been dismissed time and time again it can be a disabling condition one study found that its effects can be at least as great as epilepsy some people try to keep their emotions at bay which can affect relationships and the ability to socialise for example and others find it difficult to get a job
5499060 ive had two patients who were sent to a psychiatrist and wrongly diagnosed with psychosis
5499061 one day i hope to set up a charity to raise awareness and money for further research
5499062 there are some very innovative and proven solutions available to prevent hospital acquired conditions
5499063 our goal with the prevention above all campaign is to help healthcare providers understand the benefits of these solutions and provide the evidence they need to be assured that they offer both clinical and cost effectiveness
5499064 implementing innovative solutions is a major challenge for healthcare providers many are typically slow adopters when it comes to trying new equipment or different ways of working
5499065 providing targeted interventions that translate research findings into practice will allow healthcare providers to try new technologies with confidence

5499077 until a decade ago gay people were seen as a security threat and as recently as two decades ago they were being witch hunted and sacked from the security services
5499078 it was part of the cold war mentality that saw security threats traitors and spies everywhere
5499079 gay people were regarded as vulnerable to blackmail even if they were open and out about their sexuality
5499080 put the rights of all cohabitants on a level playing field
5499081 previous research has suggested that its not individual hiv viruses that get into the brain but rather hiv infected immune cells known as monocytes
5499082 using an animal model we wanted to find out first of all whether being infected with hiv enables monocytes to do what they dont usually do escape from blood vessels and enter brain tissue
5499083 these results demonstrated very clearly that being infected with hiv somehow gives monocytes the capacity to cross an intact bbb
5499084 but we also suspected that something else was making it easier for hiv infected monocytes to breach the defenses protecting the brain from infection
5499085 so we hypothesized that the combination of hiv infected monocytes and elevated lps levels would amplify the ability of hiv to cross the bbb and get into the brain
5499086 clearly hiv infected monocytes uniquely benefit from the lps that is present in high amounts in the blood of hiv infected people
5499087 so when hiv infected monocytes are knocking on the door of the bbb and starting to crack it open the lps facilitates their entry by making the bbb more permeable apparently by weakening blood vessel structure
5499088 these results demonstrate very dramatically that hiv infection of cells associated with the bbb in conjunction with lps exposure contributes to bbb breakdown
5499089 so when hiv infection occurs we seem to have a 1 2 3 combination of punches working in concert to facilitate entry of hiv infected monocytes into the bbb protected brain hiv infection of monocytes increases their capacity to cross even an intact bbb hiv infection in the gut releases lps into the bloodstream allowing it to erode the bbb and hiv infection of the cells of the bbb makes them more sensitive to the deleterious effects of lps
5499090 we may be able to use antibiotics that kill intestinal bacteria that make lps and drugs are already available that can bind to lps and clear it from the bloodstream
5499091 ideally we would promptly start newly diagnosed hiv infected patients on a treatment to reinforce their bbbs so that hiv cant penetrate it and perhaps we could even strengthen the bbbs of people whove been infected for quite a while but before we can prevent the tragedy of hiv associated dementia we need to better understand the mechanism by which these molecular and cellular punches interact to undermine the bbb
5499092 cerebral malaria is lethal 20 percent of the time in the best of hands and here weve shown that something as simple as aspirin because of its affect on platelets might be able to improve the outcomes of those who contract this deadly form of the disease
5499093 the take home lesson is that platelets by releasing pf4 are playing an early role in the wind up phase of cerebral malaria
5499094 our mouse studies show that timing is critical with the mice we know when we infected them and controlled when we treated them a big challenge in translating this to humans is that people dont know when they get infected platelets dont get any respect but theyre the second most abundant cell in the blood after red blood cells and packed full of factors that rally the immune system to action by taking what we know about platelets and their activation and applying it to malaria we have found a driver of cerebral malaria
5499095 that the shia doctrine of the imamate was contrary to the quran

5499098 although the iranian shiites are on the opposite side of the religious divide they have one thing in common with the saudis a priestly cast
5499099 roundly condemn the existence of a religious class of scholars as

5499111 many of these commercial projects are in important planning stages right now and the overall industry is at the tipping point that will lead to widespread adoption
5499112 the absence of the itc will kill most if not all of this growing momentum we need only look to the interruption of tax credits for the wind industry for an example of something that we do not want to repeat this would be a real shame
5499113 over the longer term however the united states commercial market is far too important to be ignored
5499114 a consistent itc policy extending over several years that allows industry to grow and flourish is critical to the industry
5499115 the itc has become a very politicized issue however and its possible that approval could extend into 2009
5499116 the jobs lost in the u s would move overseas to more favorable solar markets

5499131 no 2 is making emissions better and using less gas
5499132 we are targeting pickups suvs and vans thats the really big market
5499133 if you start with a gas guzzler that gets 12 miles per gallon or a school bus that gets 7 miles per gallon and increase that the impact is far bigger

5499152 it can vary as much among top athletes as the rest of the population
5499153 the majority of people will need up to 500ml of fluid per hour after the first 45 minutes of intense activity
5499154 for those who are prone to getting dehydrated not taking a drink could be disastrous
5499155 if the average adult loses 3 4lb of fluid their performance is seriously impaired
5499156 if they lose 7lb which is possible in the heat they are likely to get cramps nausea and experience a 20 30 drop in endurance capacity
5499157 during intense or prolonged exercise the kidneys are unable to excrete fluid as efficiently as normal
5499158 in extreme cases water is retained especially in highly absorbent brain cells and the pressure causes the body to shut down its primary functions such as breathing and heart rate treatment involves a small volume of highly concentrated salt solution but it can be fatal
5499159 its surprising how little elite runners do drink they are able to run 26 2 miles at speed with very little fluid on board
5499160 a medicine that must be ingested to prevent heat illness and optimise sports performance i believe that the body is adapted for conditions of mild dehydration
5499161 we evolved from hunters we had to run and chase animals on the hot african plains we didnt have time to pause for a drink
5499162 physiologists developed an unproven hypothesis that to become even the slightest bit dehydrated during exercise would kill you the sports drinks industry then used this bad science to market their products
5499163 has yet to find a death from dehydration in the history of competitive running
5499164 sometimes i only have to think about something funny to collapse and sometimes it happens again just as im coming round because i think about the joke that made me fall over in the first place
5499165 once i tried to calculate how often it happened in one day but i lost count at 40
5499166 it first happened one day shortly after i went to university i was sitting in my kitchen my flatmate made me laugh and i hit the floor i could hear and see everything going on but i couldnt move a muscle
5499167 i had one patient who it happened to whenever he felt smug
5499168 im always laughing sometimes my mum and i dont even have to be talking about something funny to laugh
5499169 its always at the forefront of your mind because you constantly have to assess an area for danger is there glass around any sharp corners even having a cup of tea in your hand can be dangerous
5499170 i had to stop cycling and driving at one time i thought i might not be able to have a family because what kind of a mother would i be collapsing all the time then theres the embarrassment factor all of a sudden you can fall into your dinner or your drink starts pouring straight out of your mouth
5499171 im on new medication that started working three months ago
5499172 im constantly wrestling with the difficulty of getting sodium oxybate prescribed for patients
5499173 theres an incredibly elaborate procedure for every patient and the prescribing boards stall as long as they can every time i think theres a feeling that cataplexy is a condition that doesnt need a pricey drug
5499174 its not like youre in pain with it and because it happens when you laugh people think its funny
5499175 the first doctor said it was anxiety and the second said it was my blood sugar levels the third one sent me to a specialist but only because id found out what it was myself by looking up my symptoms on the internet
5499176 its almost certainly under recognised and it usually tends to get picked up first by the patient themselves rather than a doctor i see so many people who have been dismissed time and time again it can be a disabling condition one study found that its effects can be at least as great as epilepsy some people try to keep their emotions at bay which can affect relationships and the ability to socialise for example and others find it difficult to get a job
5499177 ive had two patients who were sent to a psychiatrist and wrongly diagnosed with psychosis
5499178 one day i hope to set up a charity to raise awareness and money for further research

5499182 the sentimental belief that the things we fear will never really happen
5499183 i suggest that this is a good time to think soberly about our responsibilities to our descendants those who will ring out the fossil fuel age
5499184 i am trying to find you in this foreign country a climate i dont agree with a language i dont speak a history i dont grasp a community i dont belong to i am trying to make some sence of it all to bring order to the chaos in my mind
5499185 but really it is all just an reflection of me for just as you are a product of your time place and history so are my perceptions a product of me and my life the way i observe things the substance i substract is all a product of me by telling your story i show a reflection of me and that is what i am really looking for
5499186 the mirror is old and worn the image is the opposite of me and furthermore it is distorted by the old age of the mirror the splintered glass makes it impossible to ever see me as i truly am always seeing one fragment at a time always lacking something it will never be me only a vague reflection of what might be me and even so it is your story im telling and you are just as badly reflected so i will never be able to find you either no matter how hard i look

5499221 he doesnt need all this think time he should allow this parliamentary committee to assess what is in fact the appropriate body for tasmania
5499222 but between now and then he needs to ensure that there are appropriate mechanisms in place and to agree with our push for an inquiry will allow that void to be filled
5499223 if thats the case then he should support our moves for an inquiry
5499224 he the premier has to announce a package that is going to address some of the fundamental flaws in tasmanias democracy and governance structures
5499225 russian machines neither received any proposals to consider acquisition of the hummer assets nor is strategically interested in such a deal
5499226 the hummer is way too expensive for the chinese military and demand from civilian buyers is not big enough to justify a purchase especially with oil prices running near an all time high
5499227 we are pursuing our own models strategy and we do not want to tarnish our lean warrior strategy
5499228 weve got a government not able to put the money it needs into the health system and yet its prepared to waste 180 thousand dollars just to tell people where to put the paintings where to put the chairs
5499229 the difference in the budget for consultancy fees between this years budget and the previous years budget is huge
5499230 its about a 25 per cent increase in consultancy fees this government just wastes money on irrelevant items

5499232 many of our federations have asked us to support womens boxing in the olympics we hope well soon have the women competing there boxing is the only sport in the olympic programme without women and we believe we are ready
5499233 what we have done i think the ioc family witnessed weve made a lot of reform and changes and weve also demonstrated fair judging in the olympics
5499234 were looking forward to it the time has been there for a long while we were just waiting but weve been ready long enough
5499235 if women come in people will feel the sport is more common not so dangerous and that would be a very good thing for the image of boxing
5499236 the board knows exactly the stance of the players the players have said what they had to say it is up to the board to make the decision i am sure everything is going to be looked at
5499237 i hope we go over there and do some damage kick some russian butt
5499238 i was trying to do my best for the crowd
5499239 it makes me happy so happy i felt that i could not go out without the world record because of the support the crowd gave me
5499240 i just have 12 more to go life would be boring without records to break so i want to continue on forever
5499241 the idea of being glamorous is very important to me i always want to look like a girl i dont agree that you are either a sportswoman or a girl

5499250 there are several industries we have looked at but these are all industries that are having labour shortage crisis issues and these are all industries timor can gain skills from
5499251 what weve proposed is 300 employees and trainees in the first pilot year and were also requesting 100 occupational trainees
5499252 timor would benefit from the fact that we have such a large youth unemployed and unskilled so called bubble these people certainly would assist in timors national and human security recovery and development
5499253 i also think that given australias close relationship with east timor at the moment we have a moral responsibility to develop a workforce
5499254 we are now looking at other skilled areas that would assist timor in gaining skills so were not just talking about employment were also looking at a dual program of both employment and skilling to help timor with its own strategic industries that will help its recovery and development

5499264 the fire service seems to have some issue with what our members want to do on their days off
5499265 not only do the want to try and control what our members do during their work time but it appears theyre now seeking to try to control what they do during their off duty hours as well
5499266 the fire service with the attitude and approach of the government that theyve taken to this work value issue that our members are so upset about dont value the time that our members spent at work at night times and weekends any way because their approach has been to simply say theyre not really worth anything

5499271 my experience with naz naseem hamed and ricky hatton tells me that the audience is there
5499272 i find it astonishing that terrestrial television itv and bbc did not find the money to have amirs fights on their networks because he has shown he can guarantee huge saturday night audiences but i believe he has a big enough fan base now to make him a pay per view success
5499273 i have agreed a multi fight deal with sky and now we have got to do the business everyone said i couldnt build a star on satellite tv but i did with ricky hatton and now some suggest it is too soon to have amir as a pay per view attraction well we will see but he is getting there and when i believe the time is right to let him off the hook he will be hiding from nobody
5499274 building any fighter and getting him to the world title is all about timing
5499275 pacquiao is a terrific fighter but he is also the type who i think will suddenly get old then he will begin to look vulnerable and for me it is knowing when the time is right to risk your fighter knowing when amir is ready to win the title and to keep it
5499276 the thing youve got to remember about spain is that there was no real formula one interest there prior to alonso because they had never had a formula one driver of any consequence
5499277 spain was always a motorcycle racing country until alonso arrived there were only patchy crowds in the grandstands at tracks such as barcelona but when it came to the motogp events there was so much support from the spanish riders that they would be staging three or four events a year simply to satisfy the huge demand
5499278 you have also got to look at spain in the context of the european union economically it has been one of the great growth engines of the eu it has also become a very modern country in a relatively short period of time
5499279 when many of the current formula one generation went there for the first time in the early 1970s the place seemed grey and flat but post franco it was transformed dramatically the final aspect to consider is the sheer sporting momentum the country has displayed
5499280 whether it is alonso rafael nadal the bikes the football teams or even the americas cup programme which of course has been based in valencia too all these things have amalgamated to give added impetus to spains international reputation and justify its claim to a second grand prix
5499281 fred bowling around the wicket to a left hander is about as hard as it gets

5499283 there is a strong case to give him an opportunity to bat at no3
5499284 i am delighted with the quality of the men we have appointed to the national management team
5499285 mike brewer is a very experienced coach having worked in england italy and ireland while graham steadman is among the most experienced defence coaches in the world
5499286 scotland have a young team with a great work ethic and players who are very keen to learn
5499287 i think they have the potential to develop into a really good international side in the next three to four years and it will be good to work with frank and the other coaches
5499288 this is the eighth year in succession that the company has made a profit it demonstrates that we are able to manage our own business in the most difficult of circumstances
5499289 we have an obligation to our affiliates and advertisers to show marquee sports at peak time when the us is watching
5499290 rights holders want to maximise viewership we will work this so everyone has the best opportunity to watch
5499291 with the size of londons population there are probably world champions walking round just waiting to drop in to a facility
5499292 but the kids cant afford to participate and the gyms are miles out of town
5499293 so sometimes they would switch to the guardian because they had brilliant racing lots of people still buy that newspaper for the sport thats the way it is
5499294 our application was based on playing out of the brewery field in bridgend but we havent ruled out taking some games around wales
5499295 first we need to make sure that we can put on the right sort of game in our own backyard before we take it elsewhere but were a welsh club and we could play games at other grounds its a huge opportunity and we want to make sure we get it right
5499296 i have enjoyed being part of the club my team mates and london as a place to live but it is just the way it is
5499297 physically its possible well have a game plan and well be ready and firing for gold
5499298 its shit or bust weve both been preparing for this for a year me and chris hoy
5499299 its like a hurdle race as team psychiatrist steve peters says
5499300 im just riding for the semi final at the moment ill look at the videos tomorrow formulate a plan im surprising myself how strong i still feel after four days racing but bourgains no muppet hes been up there every year
5499301 i just want to get stuck in and do it now the waiting has been the worst part i want to take it on
5499302 its been very emotional just watching the boys and not racing watching the heats of the keirin i was in tears and it had hardly started
5499303 just a medal wont do it has to be gold
5499304 we were in sydney getting ready for a training run
5499305 linford said lets go for a walk i said what id known him for 10 years and wed never gone for a walk before but we walked down the beach at manly and he said to me ive tested positive for nandrolone id never heard of nandrolone
5499306 linford had just come along to wave to the crowd really
5499307 we know about stuff like thg now but back then linford was probably being beaten to gold medals by athletes taking it and when he tested positive he was already a millionaire he had a big house and a nice car and he was a bbc pundit why would someone like linford christie take a poor mans drug
5499308 lewis had been giving it all that stuff about how linford wasnt the real olympic champion
5499309 on the night before the final we were all in the apartment me and linford and ron roddan his coach and i saw that linford was shaking i thought look at this this is linford christie and hes nervous but when he walked out into the stadium the next day he was a different man
5499310 hed been telling me to watch everybody and to learn from everything and thats what he taught me dont show people what youre feeling so when i cramped up after the semi final of the 200 in sydney i called christian over and said just walk slowly back with me i didnt want to let anyone see the people youre competing against have got to be made to believe that youve still got that power
5499311 we spent a few years going nowhere cruising about the 4min barrier then shane sutton came along and gave us a bit of a kick up the arse the two kids clancy and thomas came along and added impetus they dont seem to know what fear is they will lap it up until christmas
5499312 we deliberately tried to go under 4min twice on the same day which had never been done before and that instilled confidence in the youngsters like ed and gee
5499313 the most ridiculous drawn out process its really disorganised and very unprofessional very disappointing when you are competing at the highest level
5499314 obviously the controls are there for a good reason im glad they are there but they could be done better
5499315 the night of the keirin saturday i took two hours to get through the whole procedure didnt get to eat in the village until 11 30 at night and i had the sprint qualifying time trials the next morning at 9 oclock
5499316 he has as much power as a sprinter powerful but capable of riding short stage races the lap and a quarter he does from a standing start sets up the whole ride and he is still capable of a lap and a half flat out at the end
5499317 he is the pivot of the team he has been there through thick and thin over the last 10 years and gave up a chance of an individual medal to devote himself to the team he is as strong as an ox the whole team revolves around him
5499318 its not only physical with him mentally he is a warrior that guy could have been on the worst day of his life today and he would still have got up and done that ride he gets everything out of himself like rebecca romero he can dig deep
5499319 its not just about what he rides he could have been on a different bike and wearing a different suit and he would still have won the individual pursuit by several seconds probably the best track rider in the world
5499320 he is a great leader a great man and a great footballer john terry can organise it and lead better than anyone
5499321 the main thing for england is that you need players who can play under pressure who can do it under the spotlight because you know theres a lot of criticism waiting out there from the public if you fail
5499322 youve got to deal with that thats the hardest obstacle weve got to get over as a team to learn to play under that intense pressure
5499323 were trying to do it were not burying our heads in the sand were going out there and trying to play getting the ball down and trying to build we need to stay cool and calm and keep going forward its pigeon steps going forward a little bit every time the world cup isnt for another couple of years so we dont want to be peaking too early we just want little bits of improvement every time and by the time we get there hopefully well be in a better position than we are in now technically physically and mentally
5499324 i have to get individuals to play for england like they do for their clubs
5499325 there has been a lack of confidence among players and its my job to rebuild that theres a lot of pressure when playing for your country and this has perhaps weighed down too heavily on some players we need to free them of that so they can play naturally without fear
5499326 for me personally playing for chelsea and playing for england are two completely different things
5499327 international football is different if youre asking me how i think we can get better its about learning to play under pressure its a process and as a group its something we need to improve on we need to go out there and play freely results help that theres no science to it but we are moving in the right direction
5499328 a captain must be a leader someone who carries the team somebody that in every moment is important for the team
5499329 there are many things i have to evaluate and i must come up with the choice that is right
5499330 it is obviously disappointing and you want to be playing for your country
5499331 but if capello doesnt put you in the squad then we have to go out and prove him wrong and i think we did that all we can do is play good football for our clubs it is out of our hands mr capello does come to villa quite a lot and i am not going to give up
5499332 meticulously devised all round face saving pr guff masquerading as an interview its easy to be honest and remorseful after you fail to get away with something not trying it on in the first place is the difficult and praiseworthy bit
5499333 he ronaldo may be young enough to be forgiven but hes old enough to have known better
5499334 i had to look three or four times i was gutted i looked at it and thought i want to be playing for wales and in that squad i knew then i had to make decisions with my career and do something about it
5499335 the move was huge in lifting a weight off me
5499336 it was made difficult for me at derby impossible in fact i was watching at times and thinking whats going on here there was something more than football going on
5499337 but i found out after the first few months that i needed to move and i wanted to move as well
5499338 it took until the summer it was a waste of a season really i should have been playing i should have been scoring goals and doing well but i wasnt on the pitch to be allowed to do that
5499339 ive had a good pre season and my mentality has gone from doom and gloom when i was not playing to being refreshed like a new flower
5499340 i turned 27 a few months ago and i want to be playing when im 35 like kevin phillips teddy sheringham and dion dublin who have carried on into their late 30s
5499341 i look at this as the second part of my career from now and ive got to do well and enjoy myself like the first half for me its about carrying on at forest and doing well there then im going to be pushing for a place with wales and theres no way i can be left out
5499342 we were in sydney getting ready for a training run
5499343 linford said lets go for a walk i said what id known him for 10 years and wed never gone for a walk before but we walked down the beach at manly and he said to me ive tested positive for nandrolone id never heard of nandrolone
5499344 linford had just come along to wave to the crowd really
5499345 we know about stuff like thg now but back then linford was probably being beaten to gold medals by athletes taking it and when he tested positive he was already a millionaire he had a big house and a nice car and he was a bbc pundit why would someone like linford christie take a poor mans drug
5499346 lewis had been giving it all that stuff about how linford wasnt the real olympic champion
5499347 on the night before the final we were all in the apartment me and linford and ron roddan his coach and i saw that linford was shaking i thought look at this this is linford christie and hes nervous but when he walked out into the stadium the next day he was a different man
5499348 hed been telling me to watch everybody and to learn from everything and thats what he taught me dont show people what youre feeling so when i cramped up after the semi final of the 200 in sydney i called christian over and said just walk slowly back with me i didnt want to let anyone see the people youre competing against have got to be made to believe that youve still got that power
5499349 hes not going to go to a better team hes really happy here and i dont know why he would want to go to a team thats not as good
5499350 this has been going on and on about santa cruz and other people
5499351 the more you keep on about it the more it unsettles what we are trying to achieve i do not want to keep saying this but nobody is going to be leaving the club
5499352 this sanction is not right because i dont think i have committed a crime that merits such an amount
5499353 i should be training tomorrow i am really glad that is not a bad injury
5499354 id like to get the algerian but dont know if i can
5499355 it would only be a loan thats what were looking for we have a problem on the right and we need someone with pace
5499356 hes a good young player whos got some ability and some experience in the premier league
5499357 andrew is one of the high earners at the club and the financial pressures placed on us by the bank have not been made secret
5499358 in the past i always felt that the team was picked before we met up
5499359 but i dont think there are any automatic choices any more and it doesnt matter who you play for if you are good enough you will get in
5499360 fabio capello is very fair and you get the feeling that if you play well you will get in the team
5499361 im looking forward to the chance to be involved against the czech republic at wembley tomorrow
5499362 its a very professional set up when you are with the squad and that is the way it should be
5499363 i wouldnt say its frightening its an atmosphere of respect its not like a boarding school its enjoyable and the coach will have banter with you his english is fairly good better than what you might think from watching him on the telly
5499364 to be perfectly honest i wouldnt entertain a move to glasgow
5499365 im happy to be playing outside scotland at the minute especially with the kind of press thats been going about for rangers and celtic im quite happy to be away from it i read the papers and i watch the television and there has been some bad press for rangers recently im afraid thats what you get at the two biggest teams
5499366 it is hard to tell but at the moment im there unless im told otherwise
5499367 i think at times michael has been his own worst enemy
5499368 he is a very demanding lad very demanding of himself i have seen a change in his outlook he seems a more mature man and that has been reflected in his performances
5499369 the one thing that george has highlighted to all of the players is that it will very much be a squad effort for world cup qualification
5499370 o charme da proposta que cada assunto ter tramita o separada
5499371 christine is having the same season as last year she looked good in the last 100m of her semi but sanya is running differently each time so you do not know how to dance with her
5499372 coach clyde hart told me whatever i needed to run dont worry about it
5499373 i am ready and i am strong i thought in my mind i might run 49 in the semi but i wasnt sure so i was happy to see 49 90 im close to seeing 48
5499374 the way i run the way i train i never look at times
5499375 my coach says running 400m is not about who is the fastest who is the strongest its about who has the most will to get to the line first
5499376 we were pretty much working in the dark last year what with the ban and injury we put on a session and the programme worked now we have had a lot more time we have planned our year properly its an interesting thing pressure but its only pressure if you allow it to be if you see it as something constructive it helps you work rather than something that suppresses you yes it was a very pressured race for me at the worlds but i dealt with it and i will again
5499377 just an average guy who got the bug to blog and found the community aspect far more enjoyable
5499378 so my lemon sherbets were a lemon being fed to a sasquatch which is wearing a plastic mac concealing a pack of sausages and a leg
5499379 and this year your birthday is also on a sunday and you will retire in 2045 on a thursday
5499380 rare but spectacular condition where someone with a developmental disability such as autism has some spectacular island of genius that stands in stark contrast to the overall handicap
5499381 a puppy teaching a lesson to a maori who was holding a microphone over a necklace owned by naseem hamed who was using a pair of tongs to hold up a bag of sherbet and pouring it into a sieve in front of an auctioneer who was selling a tentacle which was growing out of a superhero in a suit of armour who was planting a flag in my dads old garage simple as that
5499382 no one lays a hand on the moustache of a colonel in the dragoon guards
5499383 the cow she thinks shes a dog so shes interested in everything
5499384 if you carry a knife you are now more likely to get caught more likely to be prosecuted and more likely to go to prison if found guilty
5499385 no one wants to see the devastation i saw my friend and the family go through
5499386 you dont expect situations that are happening whereby people go to school in the morning and then you never see them again because of incidents that have happened we have got to help we have got a voice that kids listen to so it is important we get involved in something like this
5499387 i will never forget the day that the headmaster brought the school to a halt and said that stephen had been killed the night before it was a crazy atmosphere in school very sombre and chilling something like that really does hit home one day he is enjoying life talking about doing an art a level and the next day he is gone
5499388 in the past maybe there wasnt a strong enough deterrent for carrying knives if you go to prison now it will be a step in the right direction people need to know it is not always the person intending to hurt someone who gets injured people carrying the knives also get hurt
5499389 communities and youth centres also need to play a bigger part boredom can set in a lot of times there is a lot of peer pressure and then something happens that everyone regrets
5499390 im delighted the fa and the england team are supporting our campaign warning youngsters about the severe consequences of knife crime
5499391 you can only solve this by working together the england players are role models for this generation and i hope their messages have a positive impact
5499392 this is an extremely rare occurrence and is very exciting the king protea very rarely flowers outside of africa mainly due to the climate for fans of horticulture this is a bit like budding astronomers witnessing an eclipse from their back garden it will only flower for a little over a week so anyone wishing to come and see it should pop along soon
5499393 this is yet another major landmark for ventnor botanic garden last summer we saw the huge 35ft diameter longwood hybrid lily bloom which attracted major publicity and visitor numbers and i have no doubt the rare king protea will do exactly the same
5499394 cracking down on would be dumpers and quicker clearing up is helping us to win the battle against unsightly abandoned cars being left on our streets
5499395 a few years ago youd have had to pay someone to take your old car away but now scrap metal dealers will pay you for the pleasure this has definitely helped the situation but the council is also playing an important role weve listened to the concerns of local people and reacted accordingly
5499396 these eyesores attract crime and the public rightly expects them to be removed quickly if anyone sees an abandoned vehicle they can call the council who will send someone out to deal with it quickly and efficiently
5499397 they should hang musharraf upside down for what he has done to the poor of this country
5499398 we are taken to court if we do something wrong why not him god willing things will change for the better now
5499399 these generals have no role in politics their job is to defend the country
5499400 the government says that it cant do its job because of his interference now well see if that is true well see whos stopping who
5499401 and well see if the judges fired by musharraf in november are restored
5499402 thats where musharraf killed 3 000 maybe 4 000 islamic students the way they were butchered is unforgiveable and what did they find in there nothing it was just done to show america that pakistan acts against terrorists to keep the aid money flowing
5499403 this 9 11 happened in america why are we fighting their war before musharraf there was no al qaida here and our borders were secure
5499404 now we have the us on one side in afghanistan and india on the other
5499405 people are selling their children they should jail musharraf for that
5499406 and they are greedy corrupt there has been no change for 60 years so why should we expect it now
5499407 theres no shortage of resources in this country but we go forward a bit and then reverse we never progress
5499408 one who is not taking part in the battle nor has the sheer intention to die is in the branch of hypocrisy
5499409 what i want to do is cause trouble for the kuffar non believers with hit and runs everywhere cause fear and panic in their countries make them nervous so they make mistakes
5499410 the material in their possession promoted extreme ideology most notoriously of osama bin laden of al qaida as well as groups in various countries that adopted it
5499411 these men were not simply in possession of material which expressed extremist views they were also in possession of material that was operationally useful to anyone wishing to carry out an act of violence or terrorism
5499412 may i suggest if there are five blokes to every girl we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa
5499413 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face
5499414 whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
5499415 two women came in and said weve got to get rid of this drongo i said id be happy to help
5499416 its horrifying that a public figure would say such things what era is he living in
5499417 hes just letting people know its good fun to be a woman in mount isa
5499418 were all rednecks up here we dont carry it around as a badge of shame we carry it around as a badge of honour
5499419 if i was doing this just for myself i might have chosen a different course but i put pakistan first as always
5499420 today parliament has become sovereign we can hold our head up high in the world and say that we too are a democracy
5499421 this is the first time in pakistans political history where you have the people winning against establishment institutions
5499422 i dont want anything from anybody i have no interest i leave my future in the hands of the nation and people
5499423 theres no stable settlement these two guys sharif and zardari will now start slugging it out
5499424 even if i beat this impeachment relations between the presidency and the government can never be fixed pillars of the state parliament and the judiciary would be harmed and god forbid the army might have been dragged in
5499425 no charge sheet can stand against me because i never did anything for myself whatever i did i put pakistan first
5499426 it is important to highlight president musharrafs commitment to tackle terrorism to promote dialogue with india especially over kashmir and to root out corruption
5499427 but reform depends above all on legitimacy and that is why the uk has been at pains to stress the importance for pakistan of strong institutions rather than strong individuals and why we believe a strong democracy is key
5499428 solving the prisoner problem paves the road to solving other issues in peace negotiations
5499429 is also full of ethical implication as when we surrender control our grip over others
5499430 usually you see bait fish on the water you dont see no bait fish nothing nothings there
5499431 i dont have no kind of testing material to test the water but i know somethings wrong
5499432 were not finding enough oxygen to support life aquatic life
5499433 this green line is the oxygen right here and at the bottom its reading less than 2 milligrams per liter
5499434 theres no oxygen in the water for shrimp crabs fish to live
5499435 can sense that and they start to move out of the area otherwise they would die the animals that still remain in the sediments have to keep breathing there is not enough oxygen and eventually they will die off
5499436 thats the primary source of the nutrients that go to the gulf of mexico
5499437 and so the size of the low oxygen zone has increased in proportion to these nutrients reaching the gulf
5499438 so these things will fall to the bottom and as they decompose they consume oxygen
5499439 the deeper we go down in the water it gets kind of scary because theres nothing there theres no fish theres no organisms alive so its just us
5499440 its dark and its turbid because all that algae that is dying thats sinking through the water column
5499441 you just gotta keep going miles and miles and miles and hopefully youll run into something
5499442 the fuel costs are so high its just not feasible to get out there unless you can catch a boatload really make any money out of it
5499443 all my boats have to go somewhere else to make a living its a shame
5499444 this is the prime shrimping ground in the country right here and it shut us down it just shut us down its unreal
5499445 going off to preschool is a big endeavor for young children so we just want to make sure that we really have created those connections between school and home
5499446 its a special time to come and see where theyre going to be spending their day
5499447 very typical parent reaction no matter if its your first one or your last one sending a child off to preschool is always kind of an anxious time
5499448 the first time was a little difficult but it wasnt terrible ive seen parents that look a lot more upset than their children are
5499449 it has its moments when im like ok now i have a few minutes
5499450 i want him to be able to succeed further in life than i was able to succeed
5499451 i could just tell that i think that he would really benefit from the program
5499452 hes going to hit the parking lot at a run to get in here
5499453 there should be no question in our country of choosing between bear and man
5499454 we must find a balanced means of coexistence on the one hand the presence of bears in the pyrenees reflects a willingness to protect biodiversity on the other the support of the local population is essential
5499455 the animals have been transported to a territory they are not used to

5499458 we wanted to send a note of appreciation and gratitude to all of you for your messages of support solidarity and sincere empathy as we struggled through the making of our new album
5499459 the outpouring of concern and interest from our ardent fans very much helped us through what was a difficult time on the business side of
5499460 we felt that you deserved to know what was happening then and similarly we feel that we owe you an explanation as to what is happening right now since the time we posted that blog with
5499461 declaration of all of the albums in our catalog is the one that makes us feel the most proud
5499462 if youre a million away the only guy who benefits is the agent
5499463 tell your agent im tired of sitting at home its time to put the toys away be a man and get down to business
5499464 he didnt pull anything or strain anything it was because of a slight mechanical change he made in his delivery
5499465 im pretty much a fan that if youve been trained if you are registered then you ought to be able to carry a weapon
5499466 unless pursuant to the written regulations or written authorizations of the institution
5499467 i think they have a pretty clear and compelling reason to consider their security arrangement
5499468 its ridiculous to think that these people are going to have the expertise that law enforcement officers have
5499469 im not sure a teacher with just a concealed carry permit is the person you want protecting your school
5499470 they are showing their children theres lots to be afraid of youve got to have a weapon on your body at all times or youre in danger
5499471 well his daughter loves him so he must be a good man
5499472 its time for a recap and update for whats on tap with
5499473 first of all we want to let everyone that went to our shows in europe and gave of all of that love thank you
5499474 but before we go to japan were going to be doing our last bay area appearance at slims on september 12th
5499475 one last thing obviously if you follow the band youve been hearing about the rumors of a new record this was always a rumor up until after the tour its true that many labels have expressed interest in
5499476 ive been joking with the guys and saying well it seems like the worlds about to implode again like it did back in the 80s its so fn true there is plenty of things that will help motivate us into making a record with the sense of urgency that will inspire something that we hope will turn out special we will give it our best shot and see what we come up with ive already been writing riffs and lyrics and i have to say its going pretty well there is a lot of fire now and we intend on using it but none of that will be worth anything if we all dont come together and put forth our best effort to date its worth a try
5499477 the volcanic origin of the island makes being there an emotional interior journey
5499478 when i first visited lanzarote i found the landscape profoundly disturbing i had never seen colours so dramatically dark and i so fond of brilliant clashing colours was fascinated by the subtle obscurity of the place black had never formed part of my palette
5499479 the authorities here are not doing this because they like films but because they like money we will film their streets their people and export the image of the canaries making films is the best way to make money
5499480 the canaries have suffered a downturn in property prices in keeping with the rest of spain but the presence of almod var in lanzarote has already created a stir in terms of the amount of enquiries we are getting for properties
5499481 i want you to put it on your finger and suck it off

5499483 i didnt seriously think you were going to do that
5499484 its not that big a deal its only a bogie
5499485 really liked speaking to animals and speaking to the planet
5499486 im sure that buying trousers is a problem that the sprinters have because they do have very well developed legs to put it mildly and im sure some of the slimmer line styles wouldnt fit them
5499487 the two guys who really stand out as being likely to have trouser problems are chris and jamie staff i would imagine jamie staff has major trouser problems theyve both got a very very well developed muscle mass
5499488 i see chris and jamie around the office and they wear quite normal jeans and things like that i just think that they would probably struggle with some of the fashion type trousers if you see the legs close to they are incredibly impressive im sure that a tailor would be extremely shocked
5499489 a lot of yam banana and dumplings produce top three
5499490 i couldnt miss one day in church and my mom and dad still call to see if im going to church

5499493 i woke up around 11 i watched television and then i had some chicken nuggets for lunch i went back to my room i slept for two hours i went back for some more nuggets and came to the track

5499501 he phelps is so amazing im just glad that ive done what ive done at a games with him so i get to tell my grandchildren that i was there when michael phelps got his eight gold medals
5499502 if medals were given out for sheer guts paula would win gold
5499503 im so proud of her shes an inspiration she showed the true meaning of the olympics and should now be a contender for spoty
5499504 i was told by his teacher michael cant sit still michael cant be quiet michael cant focus
5499505 a more equal playing field there should be the same number of medals for women as men all sports should be contested by both sexes half the volunteers should be women and there should be a dramatic increase in the number of female coaches
5499506 i think i had the idea in 1996 or 1997
5499507 i went to the games in 1996 and the logo at the time was just the lion and the rings but we werent strong enough as a brand to just be a lion and the rings so coming back i wanted to find something that was less of a mouthful and also had that team feel we looked at the options and came up with team gb
5499508 when the athletes arrived they saw that and they knew they were part of a bigger team not just a group of athletes or swimmers that had a positive effect on everyone

5499511 we have always said that china is not an export led economy it is driven by domestic demand we think the supply side is going to have a harder time keeping up with demand than people think
5499512 our results were outstanding in the context of a challenging supply environment which was characterised by unexpected disruptions rising input prices skills shortages and the further devaluation of the us dollar
5499513 i think there is a difference between those commodities more leveraged to the emerging economies and those more leveraged to the developed economies
5499514 to remain high relative to historical levels albeit with higher volatility
5499515 the outlook still looks good even though there may be some impact over the next six months from the weakness in western economies bhp doesnt appear to be too worried because of the ongoing demand coming from chinas industrialisation
5499516 i dont read press i dont go on the internet much im just not into it its like the lost art of keeping a secret but it keeps my tunes closer to me and other people
5499517 over the last year the unknown thing become an issue so im not into it any more im a low key person and i just want to make some tunes nothing else
5499518 my names will bevan im from south london im keeping my head down and just going to finish my next album
5499519 the mercurys have become an increasingly important showcase for new artists and esoteric music offerings enabling them to connect with a much wider audience
5499520 historically the lesser known and more leftfield acts tend to show the biggest pickups partly as their album sales start from a relatively low base but also due to the increased profile among mainstream music buyers that the nominations generate
5499521 i would love to have sex with you one day
5499522 it is very pleasing and slightly surreal to be able to announce record half year results when the financial markets are in turmoil
5499523 while it is focused on negotiating a recommended offer for michael page adecco is keeping all its options open at this stage
5499524 we were basically stuck up the canyon without our rafts

5499526 there will be a lot of people taking advantage of the late august bank holiday so we expect the roads to the main holiday centres ports and airports will be busy
5499527 we are doing everything we can to help drivers with their journeys we have removed as many roadworks as possible and we also provide a number of information services that will help drivers
5499528 at the moment it seems that there might be fewer people driving long distances over this bank holiday weekend but it will still be busier than your typical weekend
5499529 this will be a particularly busy weekend for us with more than 140 000 people using the eurostar but we are reasonably confident that services will run as usual

5499653 it was a great scrimmage from a learning standpoint on what wins and loses games
5499654 you look at the last four minutes of games and undisciplined penalties and lack of execution can cost you games we had a lot of that last night fatigue sets in late in a game pressure sets in late in a game those two factors cause you to disrupt normal routine its something we have to work on
5499655 terry had a little better scrimmage last night but howze is still ahead of him
5499656 terry needs to work on his ability to sustain he gets fatigued and doesnt play as fast or as physical and gets exposed
5499657 it all comes with maturity and mental toughness its just hard to sustain for four quarters when you are young he did much better in the scrimmage but hes like so many of our young guys they are progressing nicely but they are going to get thrown into situations that they arent ready for yet and thats a concern

5499659 in the 1980s hizbullah was the hub from which suicide tactics spread to the palestinians and other groups
5499660 in the 1990s and beyond al qaida became the hub
5499661 so despite profound theological differences between the salafist jihadist views of al qaida and the shiite hizbullah bin laden sent his operatives to go talk to the hizbullah leadership
5499662 they came back with what were effectively operational blueprints for how to plan and execute suicide attacks especially against hard targets like embassies
5499663 they fatah eventually adopted suicide terrorism in 2000 in the second intifada years after hamas and islamic jihad
5499664 one explanation for their delay is the way prestige was locked up with particular people and within the organization you received credit and priority in the organization based on hijackings kidnappings and remote attacks it made suicide terrorism something very complicated for them to deal with organizationally it took them a long time to figure out how to adopt it

5499676 recently an extreme form of linguistic determinism has been revived which claims that counting words are needed for children to develop concepts of numbers above three
5499677 however our study of aboriginal children suggests that we have an innate system for recognizing and representing numerosities the number of objects in a set and that the lack of a number vocabulary should not prevent us from doing numerical tasks that do not require number words
5499678 in our tasks we couldnt for example ask questions such as
5499679 do these two sets have the same number of objects
5499680 thus basic numerical concepts do indeed appear to depend on an innate mechanism this may help explain why children in numerate cultures with developmental dyscalculia find it so difficult to learn arithmetic although they have plenty of formal and informal opportunities to learn to count with words and do arithmetic the innate mechanism on which skilled arithmetic is based may have developed atypically

5499736 id like to toss my hat into the ring on the issue of boxes what is up with all these boxes on line what makes a site with boxes more navigable than one without boxes why do we think that putting a box around something and then putting another box right next to that with something else in it is the best way to design a site who died and made the box king

5499749 within b amp b there are less secure mortgages especially in self certification and the gmac portfolio i will need to address these issues in coming months
5499750 pym is a safe pair of hands in our view to try to shepherd b amp b through the coming asset quality problems we feel it will suffer however we also feel he can do little to avert said problems
5499751 for one thing the kernel is quite complex and big and it inevitably simply takes time to learn all the rules not just for the code but for how the whole development environment works similarly for a new developer it will take time before people start recognizing the name and start trusting the developer to do the right things
5499752 we make it fairly easy for people to ease into kernel development
5499753 it seems to be working too we literally have thousands of people with patches attributed to them in each release
5499754 the worst thing anybody can do is to study the kernel alone and try to learn things in private and then however many months later present all the established kernel developers with a big patch that just comes out of the blue
5499755 it may not sound exciting but quite frankly i dont think anybody who starts out believing that they want to rewrite some big piece of the kernel should even bother reality isnt that simple
5499756 of course some people will be alienated and theres no doubt that the process could probably be improved
5499757 not a warm and fuzzy environment where people sing kumbaya around the fireplace
5499758 the kernel is about pretty harsh technical issues and mistakes are really frowned upon
5499759 in an os kernel there are simply more security and stability requirements and the bar is really higher in some respects that will inevitably also reflect in the response to patches
5499760 i think that one of the things weve been very good at is to scale up with a good network of maintainers so that most people involved actually dont work closely with more than a handful of people
5499761 normally the people you find at the core of open source projects are professional software engineers these guys know how to run software projects

5499790 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
5499791 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii

5499798 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5499799 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5499800 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5499801 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5499802 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5499803 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5499804 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5499805 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5499806 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5499807 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5499808 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5499809 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5499810 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5499811 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5499812 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5499813 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5499814 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5499815 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
5499816 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
5499817 viele sch tzen dass von banken eine weitere halbe billion dollar wertberichtigt werden muss f r die n chsten quartale ist eher mit einem weiteren vertrauensverlust zu rechnen
5499818 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
5499819 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
5499820 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
5499821 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
5499822 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
5499823 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5499824 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5499825 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5499826 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5499827 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5499828 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5499829 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5499830 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5499831 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5499832 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
5499833 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5499834 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
5499835 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5499836 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5499837 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5499838 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5499839 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5499840 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5499841 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5499842 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5499843 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales

5499846 conclusively show that spectrum sensing white space devices will cause harmful interference to wireless microphones during live events
5499847 simply stated the prototype devices were unable to consistently identify operating wireless microphones or distinguish occupied from unoccupied tv channels
5499848 an occurrence that takes place multiple times during any nfl game
5499849 the device did not operate in terms of transmitting a signal because it found that particular channel was occupied
5499850 there would be zero chance of causing any interference to the signals because in that situation there certainly would not be a transmission of the signal in the first place

5499935 the things that pop music was there to do for us have all been done theres nothing to rail against now when i was 15 in the north west of england the record cover to me was like a picture window to another world seeing an andy warhol illustration on a velvet underground album was a revelation it was the art of your generation true pop art
5499936 its difficult when you make a new record and you wanna play all the new songs live but with technology these days therell be someone out there with a recorder and it kinda spoils it for us you dont wanna play too many new songs because otherwise theyll be on youtube or something so we have to pick and choose if it was up to us wed play all the new songs because theyre so fun to play

5499953 the world market demand for lithium ion cells is presently at its highest point ever two major suppliers of this cell type had catastrophic fires in their assembly plants within the last year that severely diminished the available quantity to the world market the u s military requires a huge amount of this rechargeable energy source and the demand grows daily lyntronics is concerned as to how we will meet this demand and satisfy our contractual obligations currently there are no domestic producers of these cells and this is a situation which is not desirable a domestic source of lithium ion cells would help ensure that the supply to our military forces will not be jeopardized electro energys entry into this marketplace is timed perfectly we have tested and had the military test their product for use in our batteries and have concluded that their cells are well within specification we have therefore purchased a sizable quantity of cells to meet our ever increasing lithium ion needs
5499954 we are very pleased that the west virginia state police is so satisfied with the performance of our dvm 500 in car video rearview mirror systems that the agency has placed its largest order to date with our company
5499955 while the cumulative total of 516 units ordered by the west virginia state police represents the largest number of dvm 500 systems ordered by a single law enforcement agency in the united states the number of our customers that have placed multiple follow on orders after gaining field experience with their initial dvm 500s continues to expand
5499956 while this order from an international customer totals only 25 units it illustrates that law enforcement agencies are moving beyond the testing phase and into the deployment of the dvf 500 within their organizations
5499957 we have always expected that broad acceptance of the dvf 500 digital video flashlight would take more time than was the case with our dvm 500 in car video systems because we are defining and serving a market that did not exist prior to the introduction of our product on the other hand the dvf 500 provides law enforcement officers with much greater flexibility in the documentation of criminal activities regardless of their location and we believe the long range market potential for digital video flashlights will be substantial
