7400018 bila bayi minum asi secara eksklusif tinjanya berwarna lebih cerah dan cemerlang atau didominasi warna kuning karenanya disebut golden feces berarti ia mendapat asi penuh dari foremilk asi depan hingga hindmilk asi belakang
7400019 ini berarti cara ibu memberikan asi nya belum benar yang terisap oleh bayi hanya foremilk saja sedangkan hindmilk nya tidak
7400020 ini berarti bayi mendapat asi yang komplet dari foremilk sampai hindmilk supaya kandungan gizinya komplet nah ibu harus mengusahakan agar bayinya mendapat foremilk dan hindmilk sekaligus
7400021 berikan asi secara eksklusif perbaiki penatalaksanaan pemberiannya agar bayi bisa mendapat foremilk dan hindmilk
7400022 jadi tinggal dites saja asalnya dari mana dari darah ibu atau darah bayi
7400023 darah ini sangat jarang berasal dari disentri amuba atau basiler karena makanan bayi kan belum banyak ragamnya dan belum makan makanan yang kotor
7400024 ini berarti cairan empedunya tidak bisa mewarnai tinja dan ini tidak boleh terjadi karena sudah lampu merah
7400025 yang sering terjadi ibu terlambat membawa bayinya dipikirnya tinja ini nantinya akan berubah padahal kalau dibiarkan dan bayinya baru dibawa ke dokter sesudah berumur di atas tiga bulan saat itu si bayi sudah tidak bisa diapa apakan lagi karena umumnya sudah mengalami kerusakan hati pilihannya tinggal transplantasi hati yang masih merupakan tindakan pengobatan yang sangat mahal di indonesia
7400026 bisa jadi si bayi slergi terhadap susu formula yang dikonsumsinya atau susu itu tercemar bakteri yang mengganggu usus
7400027 kalau mencretnya karena minum asi ini normal normal saja karena sistem pencernaannya memang belum sempurna tetap susui bayi agar ia tidak mengalami dehidrasi tapi bila mencretnya disertai keluhan demam muntah atau keluhan lain dan jumlahnya sangat banyak serta mancur berarti memang ada masalah dengan bayi ia harus segera dibawa ke dokter frekuensi masalah frekuensi sering mencemaskan ibu karena frekuensi bab bayi tidak sama dengan orang dewasa kalau ibu mungkin sehari cuma sekali jadi kalau anaknya sampai lima kali sehari ini sudah membuat cemas
7400028 itu karena bayi belum menemukan pola yang pas umumnya di empat atau lima minggu pertama dalam sehari bisa lebih dari lima kali atau enam kali enggak masalah selama pertumbuhannya bagus
7400029 jadi yang penting lihat pertumbuhannya apakah anak tidak rewel dan minumnya bagus kalau tiga hari belum bab dan bayinya anteng anteng saja mungkin memang belum waktunya bab

7400049 i dont think the american people have awakened to whats happening the next couple of months the possibility of an african american president think about it look how short of a period its been since we came from slavery
7400050 it is one of a number of very important milestones for the african american community but this is going to be the highest
7400051 our people will be thinking of that and what king would have thought of it as well does it really mean a post racial post civil rights america
7400052 when it became apparent that barack would be making his acceptance speech on the anniversary of the great
7400053 i spend a lot of time trying to teach my children that in many respects their destiny is in their own hands i try to expose them to people and events that reinforce the idea that racial and social progress are generally the result of a lot of hard work and sacrifice by lots of people over a very long time baracks nomination stands as a milestone to the sacrifices of thousands of people who preceded us all in the struggle for equality and i wanted my children to see this process to make tangible the lessons ive been teaching them
7400054 it is going to be a capacity crowd in front of televisions in virginia washington d c and maryland

7400060 my mother and father were former sharecroppers and i can still remember when we would go to my grandmothers in south carolina in the 1950s they would sit us down and tell us if a white person was walking toward us always step into the streets and never look at a white woman

7400099 a lot of potential buyers seem to be waiting this one out its hard to buy a home when you think it might lose value especially when you have to borrow money to do it we can expect the issues with jumbo financing to slowly resolve themselves meanwhile demand is accumulating and when the market does level off there will be a catch up period
7400100 a lot of the loans that went bad last quarter were made at or just beyond the cycles peak between summer 05 and summer 06 appreciation rates for most of that period were in the double digits and lenders let many households stretch their finances to the max and beyond its that pool of beyond mortgages that the market is working its way through
7400101 i will name this child bonnie lynn to match her red hair she will be my bonnie
7400102 on the one hand we have a pent up demand from the four million jobs added to our economy over the past two years of sales decline
7400103 on the other consumers continue to wait for additional signs of market stabilization there are more people with financial capacity now than in 2005 but many are trying to market time their purchase as a result the exact timing and the strength of a home sales recovery is a bit uncertain a meaningful recovery in existing home sales could occur as early as this spring or it may be further delayed toward late 2008
7400104 although there could be some minor slippage in the first quarter existing home sales should hold in a narrow range before trending up
7400105 rising home prices in the affordable midsection of the country are likely to offset declines in some of the previously hot markets
7400106 our consumer survey shows buyers today are in it for the long haul planning to stay in their home for a median of 10 years this is a wise approach to housing because the data shows the longer you own the better your investment
7400107 some policy changes such as raising the loan limit on conventional mortgages would provide a significant boost to home sales increase liquidity strengthen home prices and lessen foreclosures but it is unclear as to if and when the measure will be implemented
7400108 nar estimates that raising the gse loan limit will result in interest rates savings for an additional 330 000 homeowners
7400109 consumers are also looking to market time interest rates and the expectations of further rate cuts are pushing some home buyers to delay monetary policy will be much more effective with a one time large cut rather than a series of small cuts
7400110 most hispanics especially tweens and teens are bilingual but the way they consume media is content driven
7400111 tweens will enjoy the inspirational value teens will identify with the challenges and successes that the characters face and parents will appreciate the shows emphasis on working hard to realize your goals

7400114 thank you tim nihart for taking good care of us
7400115 we offer simple traditional low impact reasonably priced burials this means no embalming fluid and no concrete vaults the cemetery will be maintained to provide the look and feel of a nature preserve which means no pesticides artificial fertilizers or closely mowed lawns trails will lead through the meadows woods and burial areas plain flush to the ground stone markers or native trees or shrubs may mark a grave caskets should be simply made preferably by area woodworkers working with locally harvested wood cardboard caskets available from funeral homes or through on line retailers are also acceptable as are shrouds our 100 acres bounded by both arnot forest and newfield state forest offers sweeping vistas and incredible quietude most of the land is abandoned pasture and cropland now slowly returning to forest
7400116 more importantly you dont need to take a stack of books or a history professor with you to get a sense of the people who shaped eugene informative displays are scattered throughout complete with pictures of the dead and buried a self guided walking tour begins at the northwest corner of the cemetery and the grounds are maintained well enough to make sure you see what youre supposed to
7400117 the bodys been frozen and from what we can gather its taken a while for them to get the funeral arranged
7400118 eighty three centimetres were our biggest back in 90 we thought that was pretty big
7400119 then we started getting calls for bigger and bigger caskets so i went up to 1 2m now im making them 1 3m
7400120 fifteen years ago it was two or three per day
7400121 theres no reason for anyone in this country not to have a good diet theres no reason to go out and eat a whole bag of ding dongs
7400122 if everyone went on a diet i could find something else to do
7400123 doohan is part of a generation thinking what is an appropriate tribute for my life its not just the same choices as grandma had
7400124 dad wanted us to put his body into a potato sack tie a cinder block to it and toss it into the bay
7400125 i suggested the reef ball and he loved that he could be near the critters and give back to the sea what the sea gave to him
7400126 people say they prefer to be in a reef with all that life and excitement instead of in a field with a lot of dead people
7400127 for thousands of years yet the development of the mortuary industry over the past century or so has brought us to a point where natural burial now appears to be
7400128 director of the funeral ethics organization and a former president of the fernwood cemetery on the nations second commercial green cemetery the nations first commercial green cemetery
7400129 my dear its tough its really tough you have to get up at four oclock in the morning and start preparing the meat and dough before the people arrive because once they do arrive it is time to serve
7400130 ousie susana bring the tablecloth this pot has burnt me
7400131 its very tiring my dear because you do everything from making coffee and tea for the guests to serving them with a cup of soup and a whole cooked meal
7400132 whats frustrating sometimes is that nowadays the younger girls do not want to help us with our work
7400133 most of them come from the city and do not see themselves behind the fire like this
7400134 every time i serve someone with some food or a cup of warm soup theres a kind thank you or that the food was delicious
7400135 what can we do the job has to be done
7400136 take this with you its freshly cooked beef which i think you will remember us by
7400137 we serve people of all religions and try to accommodate what their beliefs are as best we can
7400138 i think that larimer county has a vast number of different religions and cultures and as fort collins grows funeral homes have to be able to accommodate different groups with different rituals
7400139 you invoke the supreme powers to assist you in sending off the human form
7400140 it was tough to build a fire we had to make do
7400141 i was quite surprised i didnt think the priest would be so elaborate he knew exactly what to do
7400142 to try to replicate rituals in india this is the closest they can come to it
7400143 whatever cultural rituals that a family has we do whatever we can to make that happen
7400144 we are seeing more and more of what we would call personalization
7400145 i felt like it was the right way for me personally to say goodbye and to honor her
7400146 it also hooks together life and death and makes you realize that death is a big part of living
7400147 it isnt scary but you have to be in the right frame of mind to do this
7400148 in grieving families go through the steps as they see fit
7400149 people who love obits collect obits scrapbook obits mail me obits that i wrote 10 years ago because they thought i might like it
7400150 the creation of a style largely about pathos and understatement
7400151 people who happened to be there when big things happen
7400152 if youre talking about an african dictator and how hes changed the map show the map
7400153 you can hear the emotion in the voice how much the person cared for this person
7400154 life on the death beat a handbook for obituary writers
7400155 the family interaction from the time the first call comes in were involved all the way through the process
7400156 its emerged to the point that its a much safer vehicle for families
7400157 new jersey specifically has very strict laws that protect the consumer and protect their money in pre paid arrangements
7400158 at one time everyone had a limousine went to a church bought a casket
7400159 now youve got choices theres just a lot more out there for people to choose and they do choose
7400160 youre paying for a funeral at todays prices for years to come
7400161 people come in with a clear mind and it lifts the burden off the children its a growing part of the business
7400162 just because youre getting cremated doesnt mean you dont have a funeral a viewing things of that nature
7400163 you like to help people and youre committed to the funeral service theyre coming to you in a time of need at the lowest point in their life and you have to have the professionalism to deal with them
7400164 youre on call 24 hours a day dealing with stressed out people
7400165 but it is a business and they are there to make money
7400166 you wouldnt go to a car dealer the day after your partner died and be expected to make a good decision
7400167 you want someone who is going to do what you want without judgment without stress
7400168 its a very stressful time and there should be flexibility like any other business to try and make you happy
7400169 its like a mini surgery and as the fluid circulates through the body the discoloration and texture of the skin even out
7400170 embalming also prevents the spread of infectious disease because once the bodys natural immune responses shut down any bug it has is free to roam
7400171 dying is a natural end to all of this but we have become a death denying society we dont understand what it means to die
7400172 im not there to console them or talk about the persons life i didnt know that person but i do the best i can try to provide a service theres nothing you can say to fix the situation but you can make the process as easy and smooth as possible
7400173 i had been to open casket ceremonies but i had never dealt with a body one on one it wasnt strange at all it was something i could do for her for the family for myself it brought closure
7400174 theres nothing disgusting about it you actually gain a lot more respect and understanding for what they go through between death and burial
7400175 usually its just quiet and you wonder what the person was like did they hurt a long time what kind of life did they have you look at them and their pictures and you wonder what the other family members are thinking and feeling
7400176 people are proud they dont want anyone to think theyre cheap or poor so they end up spending 7 000 just to prove they love someone others get mad at the funeral home because it costs that much but they choose everything the prices are different for different services and you dont have to spend the money unless you want to
7400177 there have been all kinds of studies done about grieving customs in the hispanic and black communities
7400178 they usually have a funeral and a viewing and a service at home they grieve and have dinner together they laugh and cry they dont necessarily get over it but they overcome death so much faster then people who never experience the loss that has nothing to do with my selling a reality
7400179 babies are taught to say bye bye when someone leaves when someone dies its kind of the same thing people show up to a funeral to say goodbye one last time they need that closure but from the time were kids were taught not to talk about death
7400180 expired passed away gone to the lord we deny the word death
7400181 were here to help people get over that but we want them to do whatever they need to to feel better there is no law saying they have to go to a funeral home all we can do is listen be fair be honest then we give them a bill and they thank us for it what could be more rewarding
7400182 we have to keep the doors open and if we take advantage of people they dont come back that keeps us in check
7400183 people come in with a problem and we get them through it and back to life as quickly as possible
7400184 some of robyns good women friends went to the viewing at the mortuary and circled around her body and told stories and cried and laughed and commented that it just didnt look like her except for her hands
7400185 it takes a while for a spirit a soul to totally leave the body but the mortuary picks that body up right away
7400186 when people see clearly that what was in the body is no longer there the grieving comes easier and the healing comes faster
7400187 i know i wont put funeral homes out of business and i dont want to talk anybody into anything i just want folks to have what they want and be educated about it funeral homes do the best they can with the light they have to see by but people may not know what all of their choices are
7400188 any duly authorized representative of any church fraternal order or other association or organization honoring the dead
7400189 i havent been able to find anything that restricts where you can bury a body or scatter ashes there may be a provision out there somewhere but its not within the rules and regulations for morticians
7400190 if my family member dies in the hospital i can go and get the body put it in the car and drive off what i did with it would be pretty much up to me
7400191 there are laws against desecration but if youre just trying to take care of someones remains there is no law against burying bodies outside of a cemetery
7400192 both fellows told me to watch my back and i realized there are people out there who are going to be looking for anything we do wrong
7400193 i dont want to come across as out there counter culture new age hippie whatever but i grew up in a time when if you didnt like the social order you worked for change
7400194 i dont like the social order so im working for change and im not in competition at all its a totally different service
7400195 for many of us in our sprawling modern society a family cemetery that spans generations is no longer a viable option everywhere burial space is increasingly expensive and difficult to find cremation is often the best option available many of us want to do
7400196 there needs to be a place for crematoriums in our world
7400197 its the scale of the project that gives me pause
7400198 we told her cannot at this point decide to devote 50 acres of town owned land to this project
7400199 its such a significant part of the land were interested in developing
7400200 ive pretty much been the ralph nader of the funeral industry
7400201 the idea of a tree burial or sea burial is based on environmental and land availability concerns we hope they will serve as a suitable alternative to traditional interment and replace complicated funeral services
7400202 studies show that students who have studied latin for at least two years score 200 300 points higher on sat and gre college exams
7400203 one company launches cremated ashes into space while another compresses them into sparkling diamonds a third fits headstones with solar powered plasma screens that play a short movie about the deceaseds life
7400204 the trends are clear more and more people are opting for less expensive more expedited and less traditional methods preferring celebrating a persons life to mourning their death
7400205 staff at the federal trade commission are fond of saying the agencys acronum ftc stands for
7400206 in this market now staging is desperately needed even more so because its so competitive
7400207 the complete idiots guide to staging your home to sell
7400208 how you decorate to live in your house and how you decorate to sell your house are very different
7400209 the way that we kind of word it is that clutter eats up equity
7400210 if theres a bookshelf im going to pack up two thirds of those books and put them away and basically just arrange the rest in nice little displays
7400211 they had themed bedrooms one room was all clowns another was superheroes
7400212 in order to appeal to a broad audience youve got to take that away or it will not sell
7400213 a lot of times ill suggest painting the front door
7400214 if you have a limited budget and can only afford to replace the entryway flooring or the guest bedroom carpeting choose the foyer it is the first impression
7400215 he took the drapes down and the house sold in seven days
7400216 closets should be half full and you should be able to see the bottom of the closet
7400217 it could be three pieces of art on the wall it also could be candlesticks something tall medium and short
7400218 you want as much light to come in as possible
7400219 if theres drapery i try to make it as sheer as possible or pull it to the side
7400220 you want people to come in and say i could live here
7400221 the world began without the human race and it will end without it
7400222 out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing there is a field ill meet you there
7400223 life is a challenge meet it life is a dream realize it life is a game play it life is love enjoy it
7400224 in america few people will trust you unless you are irreverent
7400225 come on down youre the next contestant on the wedding is right
7400226 the jury is still out how big shale is going to be
7400227 right at the time oil prices are skyrocketing were struggling with the economy were concerned about global warming and national security threats remain intense we wake up and weve got this abundance of natural gas around us
7400228 you can have a transition with natural gas that is cheap abundant and clean
7400229 the more democratic encounter is the meeting properly chaired allowing everyone their say
7400230 generally lends itself to games centred on chat co operation and turn based play
7400231 allow anyone who wants to use existing bbc content to do so
7400232 the little acknowledged challenge is the creation of new media forms that are of the medium rather continually peddling old forms that are simply acquired over it
7400233 this whole thing has been quite a strange experience for me
7400234 we can change the world you are going to do it
7400235 lets kick some arse tomorrow for the sake of my sanity
7400236 if you want to vote labour we give you a f ing good reason not to
7400237 the internet is only doing to politics what it has done to other industries it disaggregates elements and then enables these free atoms to reaggregate into new molecules
7400238 what digital footprints are existing for you right now its not an ego search but to find what others are saying about you
7400239 should learning professionals be leading the charge around new work literacies such as social media and informal learning
7400240 my responsibility is to work on my own sphere of influence starting with our online course development team leading by example for our facilitators
7400241 we have to abandon the conceit that isolated personal actions are going to solve this crisis our policies have to shift
7400242 de vorige keer was het best wel spannend zou ik nu weer gaan kijken
7400243 gij hebt gehoord dat er gezegd is gij zult niet echtbreken maar ik zeg u een ieder die een vrouw aanziet om haar te begeren heeft in zijn hart reeds echtbreuk met haar gepleegd
7400244 ieder van ons zal zich dus tegenover god moeten verantwoorden
7400245 the large print giveth and the small print taketh away
7400246 in all candor as an adult ive been known to forget occasionally the discretion expected of a person of my many years and station when i believe ive been accorded a lack of respect i did not deserve
7400247 resisting being uncooperative and a general pain in the ass proved as it had in the past to be a morale booster for me
7400248 for much of my life the navy was the only world i knew it is still the world i know best and love most
7400249 as a young man i would respond aggressively and sometimes irresponsibly to anyone who i perceived to have questioned my sense of honor and self respect those responses often got me in a fair amount of trouble earlier in life
7400250 i think if you look at the overall record and millions of jobs have been created et cetera et cetera you could make an argument that theres been great progress economically over the last eight years
7400251 i think americans are hurting and hurting badly in fact i think americans are not better off than they were eight years ago when you look at whats happened to middle income americans
7400252 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should
7400253 i have far more experience on the economy than senator obama im very strong on the economy
7400254 i have regretted losing my temper on many occasions but there are things worth getting angry about in politics
7400255 at the smallest provocation i would go off into a mad frenzy and then suddenly crash to the floor unconscious when i got angry i held my breath until i blacked out
7400256 i told you we needed a stage you incompetent little shit when i tell you to do something you do it
7400257 im so glad youre out of a job and ill see to it that you never work again
7400258 if you dont cooperate on this project youll be the shortest tenured supervisor in the history of the forest service
7400259 theres no doubt in my mind that we will prevail and theres no doubt in my mind once these people are gone that we will be welcomed as liberators
7400260 were going to prevail and we will win and itll be one of the best things thats happened to america and the world in a long time cause itll reverberate throughout the middle east
7400261 were succeeding i dont care what anybody says ive seen the facts on the ground
7400262 we are extremely disappointed to see that the level of objectivity at nbc news has fallen so low that reporters are now giving voice to unsubstantiated partisan claims in order to undercut john mccain
7400263 it is a shame that the new york times has lowered its standards to engage in a hit and run smear campaign
7400264 i dont know if you can understand this george but that really hurt that really hurt
7400265 als zon klein beestje de moed niet opgeeft zal ik het ook niet doen eenmaal zal ik weer als een vrij man rondlopen
7400266 but where are the lamps how will it be lighted
7400267 each time you are in church the area where you are seated will be lighted
7400268 each time you are not here that area will be dark this is to remind you that whenever you fail to come to church some part of gods house will be dark
7400269 opa wat zijn die mannen daar aan het bouwen en wat doen die dieren daar
7400270 die mannen michiel die zijn een kerststal aan het bouwen een kerststal waarin het kindje jezus is geboren
7400271 er was geen plaats meer in de herberg en de ouders van het kindje jezus moesten toch ergens slapen dus zijn ze maar in een stal gaan slapen tussen de dieren
7400272 waarom was er dan geen plaats in de herberg opa
7400273 kom jongen laten we eens op dit bankje gaan zitten kunnen we de mannen goed bekijken en dan lees ik het kerstverhaal voor uit de bijbel lucas 2 die ik altijd bij me heb zei opa
7400274 what does this community need and what could a website be if it had the assets of a newspaper to start with
7400275 how to create uncontested market space and make competition irrelevant
7400276 revive newspaper classifieds by finding a new business model thats relevant in the internet age
7400277 figuring out how to help employers realtors auto dealers solve problems
7400278 then it becomes a profession which is difficult and sometimes nasty
7400279 we do need to consider technology as a toolset that is at the service of organisations and their primary functions i also believe as that design comes before technology designing the right thing again
7400280 the taste of 16 to 24 year olds is remarkably similar to that of those over 65
7400281 is that sex segregation does not reflect sex differences between men and women rather it constructs them
7400282 women are told around that time that they are athletically inferior to men and that they should start acting like ladies thats why we see the boys making such stunning gains at that age and the girls begin to suffer
7400283 the boys 13s we can handle pretty consistently but when the boys start really developing at 14 and especially 15 thats when you start to see real separation and they pass even the best womens players theyre just bigger stronger and faster
7400284 why on earth are pool and ping pong sex segregated
7400285 you would not believe the amount of men in my world who can wax me
7400286 theres a whole establishment thats invested in perpetuating the notion that there are not inborn differences between the genders athletically and that any differences can only be attributable to sociological circumstances and societal oppression they have a clear agenda to empower women through a distorted notion of equality but these people are saying things that are completely out of touch with biological reality
7400287 ive been at faculty meetings where the notion that there are differences in the genders is ridiculed
7400288 t he first woman dean at harvard was my dean when she got here and when i would try to bring up studies that showed inborn gender differences she wouldnt even allow it
7400289 when you have a large group of people with a vested interest in maintaining an agenda
7400290 theyre going to find ways to attack anyone or anything that threatens their existence
7400291 at most newspapers title ix is gospel at this point and anything that could be seen as an argument against it is going to be ignored attacked or ridiculed
7400292 i have a colleague here in town that has a biologically based view of gender differences shes done a whole lot of research that shows fairly large important differences between boys and girls in their socio relationships at an early age and she was prevented from publishing that at several points from people who just didnt want to hear that point of view regardless of the evidence

7400312 it may take me 20 30 40 50 upward of 100 rounds to destroy a target
7400313 now im attacking a target with one or two rounds
7400314 it allowed us to destroy everyone inside or on top of the building and then walk in
7400315 in the days leading up to the primary sleep was losing out
7400316 the campaign wasnt focused on virginia so we couldnt get literature from them
7400317 i couldnt live with myself if i didnt do everything i could to get obama elected
7400318 the last time virginians voted for a democrat for president was 1964 before the voting rights act of 1965 was passed i think its shameful thats what turned it and i think its a beautiful thing that an african american candidate is going to turn it back the american experience has engendered this really festering wound over race its the elephant in the room i dont think this is going to solve it but it will go a long way
7400319 right now in pueblo im the only one im working out of my house im waiting for victory to come in
7400320 right now there are three mccain yard signs that arent spoken for and they cant tell me when i can get more
7400321 weve done it before were a couple of cycles ahead of them on the ground game thats why theyre spending so much money
7400322 sir can i help you update your voter registration or sign up for a mail in ballot
7400323 there was another time when another young candidate was running for president and challenging america to cross a new frontier
7400324 he faced public criticism from the preceding democratic president who was widely respected in the party
7400325 ted has been at the forefront of every single cause thats important to democrats for my entire adult life
7400326 having gotten to know him in the senate what i came to realize was hes probably the hardest working senator that we have and during this campaign what ive seen is the sheer joy he gets out of politics he cares so deeply about the people hes fighting for but he also just enjoys being the mix and the give and take
7400327 the man who just spoke is going to be president of the united states and he is going to change this country
7400328 the kennedy family has been with us from the very early days
7400329 every major civil rights battle senator kennedy has been there hes been a warrior hes been a fighter hes been a workhorse for civil rights
7400330 everybody working on the campaigns for the parties for the state parties you can run into them talk to them learn from them get their cards and its quite useful
7400331 the very fact of the hype attracts so many moths to the flame and theres a ton of information you pick up that is valuable in the longer term
7400332 its pretty absurd that there are 15 000 media people going theres not enough news and information to feed all those journalists you have to be careful not to spend too much time trading conventional wisdom with other reporters
7400333 ultimately we look forward to a debate between joe biden and barack obama about whether barack obama has the judgment and experience to lead
7400334 the choice on iraq in this election is clear and compelling
7400335 joe biden believes the war was a mistake john mccain would still do it all over again joe biden knows the bush mccain policy has weakened our hand fighting terrorism and finding osama bin laden john mccain started beating the drums for war after september 11th and wants to double down on the bush policy for four more years if barack obama and joe biden had set iraq policy these last six years rather than george bush and john mccain we wouldnt be in the hole were in today
7400336 the president always has the right to act preemptively if we are in imminent danger if they are coming up over the hill he can respond if troops are coming out of tijuana heading north we can respond if they are coming down from toronto we can respond if missiles are on their way we can respond but that is not the way i hear it being used here we are talking about preemption as if we are adopting a policy
7400337 the power of the purse is useless because it presents us with a hobsons choice
7400338 we have our fighting men and women in place and we are told by the way the president will not take them home so lets cut off the support for them so they have no guns no bullets no ability to fight a war and no one is willing to do that
7400339 may not be as good as other headliners the first three nights but hopefully it will make clear the choice the american people will face in november
7400340 the hesitation on him as a speaker was that he didnt even hold federal office yet so how prominent could he be
7400341 he was unproven but we became convinced that he also offered incredible promise
7400342 they are interesting experiences i think i would have perhaps liked to have had more questions from the audience
7400343 can you tell me how to do with silverlight and how to work on that
7400344 on seeing the police team the accused started firing from inside and in retaliatory firing two were killed
7400345 the first person that he obama sat down and talked to about this vice presidential issue was senator clinton they had a discussion back in early june and he spent more time with her talking about issues than he has with joe biden or anyone else in the last couple of months
7400346 senator clinton is going to make a great speech on tuesday night were going to come out of this as a unified party because we know the stakes are so great and we have to change the direction of this country
7400347 she is going to be an important voice in this campaign and in moving this country forward in the next administration but he obama felt that senator biden would be the best fit for him at this time
7400348 we will take our orders from sheik osama bin laden because we are his students
7400349 al qaeda is the mother of the holy war in somalia
7400350 most of our leaders were trained in al qaeda camps we get our tactics and guidelines from them many have spent time with osama bin laden
7400351 there are indications of a fairly close shabab al qaeda connection though its not clear to what extent theyve been operationalized
7400352 is shabab taking orders from al qaeda i would say no they are still running their own show
7400353 once we end the holy war in somalia we will take it to any government that participated in the fighting against somalia or gave assistance to those attacking us
7400354 and they cant afford to do that because the clans provide their foot soldiers
7400355 they are still a threat but clearly their network and operations have been degraded

7400454 this direct mapping of pitches so important it bears are repeating if i put electrodes in your visual cortex the part of the brain at the back of the head concerned with seeing and i then showed you a red tomato there is no group of neurons that will cause my electrodes to turn red but if i put electrodes in your auditory cortex and play a pure tone in your ears at 440 hz there are neurons in your auditory cortex that will fire at precicely that frequency causing the electrode emit electrical activity at 440 hz for pitch what goes into the ear and comes out of the brain

7400457 after shafer edited out the attack of orchestral instrument recordings he played back the tape and found that it was nearly impossible for most people to identify the instrument that was playing without the attack pianos and bells sounded remarkably unlike pianos and bells and remarkably similar to one another if you splice the attack of one instrument into the steady state or body from another you get varied results in some cases you hear an ambiguous hybrid instrument that sounds more like the instruments that the attack came from than the one the steady state came from michael castellengo and others have discovered that you can create entirely new instruments in this way for example splicing a violin bow sound onto a flute tone creates a sound that strongly resembles a hurdy gurdy street organ the experiment showed the importance of the attack
7400458 our culture and indeed our very language makes a distinction between a class of expert performers the arthur rubinsteins ella fitzgeralds paul mccartneys and the rest of us the rest of us pay money to hear the experts entertain us jim knew that he wasnt much of a singer or a dancer and to him a public display of singing and dancing implied he thought himself an expert the villagers just stared at jim and said what do you mean you dont sing you talk jim told me later it was as odd to them as if i told them that i couldnt walk or dance even though i have both my legs singing and dancing were a natural activity in everybodys lives seamlessly integrated and involving everyone ho bina as in many of the worlds languages also means to dance there is no distinction since it is assumed that singing involves bodily movement
7400459 the catholic church banned music that contained polyphony more than one musical part playing at a time fearing that it would cause people to doubt the unity of god

7400469 she was supposed to have come thursday to see me
7400470 yeah but i could throw together something like that using the ore without adding something to the bookshelf
7400471 tevens ben ik van mening dat door mijn beslissing ook uw inzet als politiejunior voor ons korps onverenigbaar is daarom is de heer x verzocht om uw contract als politiejunior te be indigen
7400472 in brightest day in blackest night no evil shall escape my sight let all those who worship demon might beware my power the silver flames light
7400473 ik vind het heel jammer dat dit op deze manier allemaal gegaan is
7400474 mijn inziens zou je tot een heel goede politie agent kunnen uitgroeien gezien mijn ervaringen die ik in deze tijd met jou heb opgedaan
7400475 necessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom it is the argument of tyrants it is the creed of slaves
7400476 those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
7400477 and by the time i made the decision to transition my gender dissonance had gotten so bad that it completely consumed me it hurt more than any pain physical or emotional that i had ever experienced when i made the decision to transition i honestly had no idea what it would be like for me to live as female the only thing i knew for sure was that pretending to be male was slowly killing me
7400478 necessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom it is the argument of tyrants it is the creed of slaves
7400479 those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety

7400483 a non muslim may not become a citizen of the maldives
7400484 no law contrary to any tenet of islam shall be enacted in the maldives
7400485 may not be as good as other headliners the first three nights but hopefully it will make clear the choice the american people will face in november
7400486 i am sure the russians have left other surprises for us
7400487 they want to disrupt our life and our economy as much as possible
7400488 its been quiet where i was for the past two weeks but now i am worried even though i am happy to be back
7400489 i am afraid that what happened here with the russians will happen again
7400490 the situation in the black sea is tending to become more tense
7400491 nato countries are building up their naval presence to deliver humanitarian aid i do not think that this will contribute to the stabilization of the situation in the region
7400492 it is still not safe in certain other villages with high concentrations of cluster munitions
7400493 they found the weapon in the room and were playing with it when it went off
7400494 our top priority is restoration of the judges and we want it done on monday
7400495 the alliance is intact today but its future depends on the fulfilment of the promise zardari made for the restoration of the judges
7400496 what this may do is move us back from say a moderate drought to only a slight drought
7400497 and in some places there wont be any drought at all after this event
7400498 fay with this very heavy rain its producing and still could produce in the next 2 3 days it could really help that situation
7400499 its nearly stationary and will remain for 12 to 24 hours
7400500 its the biggest event in the history of the city
7400501 weve been told to expect a large number of protests
7400502 weve heard a lot of businesses are going to be closed
7400503 i know im going to have to find a new route into town
7400504 its hard enough to get a customer in the door without having them escorted by the cia or someone else
7400505 were going to get a lot of visibility from people coming into this area i dont think it will hurt
7400506 we have been working two shifts a day and are ahead of schedule
7400507 weve already started shooting places and plan on going until mccain and his staff dont remember any more if it takes up a season two we just dont know mtv brass have left the schedule open ended at this point
7400508 we usually give them a couple of days to clean up the drug paraphernalia get rid of the hookers and dry out a little so they come across as marginally coherent then were in and out in an hour
7400509 with the senator a lot of it is waiting around while he tries to figure out where he lives and then jetting off to shoot it were up to seven locations right now although cindy mccain is getting fuzzy recollections of an island or country she might have bought in the early nineties so we expect that number to up a bit
7400510 you should have heard the senator scream when he was taking that thing from the second to the first floor
7400511 senator mccain admitted that he likes to pee in them occasionally just so everyone knows whos in charge
7400512 he called them solitary confinement and he said they were for meditation or to remind him of the more trying times that he overcame
7400513 good try but not good enough the american people will tire of that they know everything that is at stake in this contest
7400514 the fact that the republicans rolled out this ad now just shows the bankruptcy of this campaign
7400515 just because youre older doesnt mean youre not for change
7400516 joe biden has been a fighter for change he has resisted the status quo in his career he has experience in washington but he is not of washington d c as you know
7400517 he lives close by in delaware and goes home to his family including his mother who lives with him so joe biden is the all american boy
7400518 and his place on this ticket is one that enhances the ticket in terms of how it will govern in january but also increases our prospect for success
7400519 the statement that sen clinton put out supporting biden was a very very strong statement
7400520 i think her campaign was about experience his bidens campaign is about experience but both of them would have been agents for change just because youre experienced doesnt mean youre stuck in the status quo of washington d c and any of you who have watched joe biden over the years know he can be iconoclastic in terms of the status quo in terms of washington d c
7400521 with this election we have the opportunity to close one chapter in our nations history one marked by the years of a war that never should have been waged of deficits and economic decline that never had to happen and write a new part of the american story
7400522 the online travel space large opportunity with different business models
7400523 on a tour of one of his supermarkets kishore biyani notes that shopping carts are getting stuck in the narrow aisles wheat and lentils have spilled onto the floor black spots cover the onions and its difficult to hear above the constant in store announcements
7400524 the shouting the untidiness the chaos is part of the design
7400525 officer ne flight pakadne se pahle driver ko diesel bharvane ke liye bheja tha lekin driving karte driver so gaya aur costly mercedes ka accident ho gaya
7400526 does it look like gomer pyle or some bucktoothed beaver
7400527 and youve got an 80 000 pound runaway truck on your hands
7400528 brought to you by the all new dodge ram 1500
7400529 because id never written songs before we didnt know what the rules were
7400530 we didnt know you shouldnt write about the tasteless things going around in your head
7400531 this musical is coming from the mind of dana marschz the teacher and he doesnt think its funny and hes not trying to be offensive
7400532 the joke of it is that hes so damaged and hes trying to be so honest with his feelings but hes so limited with his abilities that it ends up being completely inappropriate
7400533 hes the son of god and i think thats cool
7400534 so why do i feel like ive been raped in the face
7400535 it maybe came out of frustration because we had seen so many musicals and we were trying to do something that was really funny
7400536 im not pretending these songs are as good as any musical ever
7400537 i hope people will think theyre a breath of fresh air
7400538 china has won the most gold medals and the united states of america won the most total
7400539 i believe each country will highlight what suits it best one country will say gold medals the other country will say the total tally counts we take no position on that
7400540 in the end there wasnt much reason for me to smile
7400541 because the pressure of being a gold medalist is huge
7400542 if theres one surefire way to convince everyone vista is cool cutting edge and not liable to get frazzled by lifes minor complications its hiring a 1990s sitcom star and professional kvetcher
7400543 who um very visibly owned a series of macs on his show
7400544 microsoft doesnt like being cast as a stodgy oldster by apples advertising and has turned to jerry seinfeld oh so they want to be cast as late middle age almost stodgy oldster
7400545 it just doesnt make sense to try and get college students to want your product by using a comedian that their parents love it is just like microsoft to attempt to copy mac in everything they do but instead they make a pile of steaming trash
7400546 if theres one surefire way to convince everyone vista is cool cutting edge and not liable to get frazzled by lifes minor complications its hiring a 1990s sitcom star and professional kvetcher

7400550 you make sure you are focused on what your goal is and what you want to achieve thats just all that i did i was focused on what i wanted to do and what i wanted to accomplish
7400551 i dont know what makes me different it beats me i do what i love i love to compete and i love to swim i have very very high goals that i have set for myself and thats what really motivates me and keeps me going strong
7400552 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 metres
7400553 i am a performer i come down here to perform and if the people enjoy themselves i did well this is my job
7400554 i think i managed to give hope to all the 40 somethings out there i hope that i showed them that if you want something bad enough you can get it
7400555 i always feel like i dont have that physical gift i just have the gift of determination and work but it would be so fun to also have the other side of it that athletes like michael phelps are blessed to have
7400556 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7400557 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the rest of the world
7400558 the sky is blue the air is clear the olympics created this image for us but can we sustain it i dont know
7400559 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7400560 but they are a seed of change compared with the situation before
7400561 the world today is in need of mutual understanding inclusiveness cooperation and harmonious development
7400562 the beijing olympic games is a testimony of the fact that the world has its trust rested upon china
7400563 i really hope people remember the friendliness of the chinese our happy attitudes and our welcoming ways
7400564 it will be hard to pick a favorite memory from these games
7400565 good try but not good enough the american people will tire of that they know everything that is at stake in this contest
7400566 the fact that the republicans rolled out this ad now just shows the bankruptcy of this campaign
7400567 just because youre older doesnt mean youre not for change
7400568 joe biden has been a fighter for change he has resisted the status quo in his career he has experience in washington but he is not of washington d c as you know

7400574 kashmir is an integral part of india the idea of allowing kashmir to the separatists just because a section of pak backed people dont want to live with us is preposterous
7400575 it needs immense patience on the part of political leadership and policy makers to handle such a sensitive issue
7400576 the deafening silence of the muslims from the rest of india on the kashmir issue clearly shows they dont want to get involved in it they are afraid of a backlash from the hindutva hardliners
7400577 the fact that the matter of land transfer to the amarnath shrine board was allowed to snowball into a huge crisis shows the inefficiency of the entire political leadership the lawenforcing agencies will have to stamp out anti national activities
7400578 three young men set out to break a record by visiting all of the 48 u s states on a incredibly fast road trip they used maps to meticulously plot their route and while driving for the 106 hours and 43 minutes cross country used a gps the result was that from sunday may 4 through thursday may 8 the three traveled to every one of the 48 contiguous states
7400579 i kind of follow my husband on that he follows these things more closely
7400580 faith in 2009 how an obama administration will engage people of faith
7400581 there is absolutely in this party a tremendous intersection of faith and politics
7400582 its great to see that faith is being acknowledged finally
7400583 especially in my community when your pastor talks about something in church you go out and do it politically this could help
7400584 theyre frustrated in talking about abortion and gay marriage now especially with younger evangelicals they want to talk about poverty and climate change and darfur
7400585 if the democrats can show that theyll take action on these issues and not just talk about them theyll pick up a lot of votes in the middle
7400586 it wouldnt be wise for me to be seen as picking a political side when ive consistently said both sides are right in some areas and wrong in some areas
7400587 whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective
7400588 answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
7400589 i really appreciate the way sen obama has been vocal in public about his faith
7400590 but he has not been clear in expressing his stands on issues that matter to christians so it will be hard for him to sway evangelicals
7400591 if i hadnt seen them back to back at the saddleback event id have thought obama hit it out of the park but hes such a swirl of colors that while hes eloquent in the end he sounds vanilla
7400592 admittedly for a lot of us mccain is an acquired taste
7400593 el derecho a divorciarse asi como el de contraer matrimonio es un derecho personal simo que forma parte del catalogo de derechos de la personalidad
7400594 the petitioner must prove the acts that reasonable demonstrate the frustration of the purpose of matrimony
7400595 maybe thats a marriage you shouldnt enter into in the first place
7400596 the civil code has been revised the draft proposed for public discussion
7400597 senator mark christensen has introduced legislation which would make it harder to get married in the state
7400598 classes would focus on conflict management financial responsibility and communication and parenting skills the classes would be taught by clergy marriage counselors or any other qualified instructors
7400599 the marriage penalty is alive and well and thriving in the amt
7400600 eliminated the marriage penalty for many married couples and mitigated it for others but have not done away with it entirely
7400601 this is about whats good for texas deep down people dont want to be a part of separating families
7400602 the republican party is supposed to be for limited government
7400603 when youve got somebody that doesnt want you when its over its over
7400604 why not allow them to go on with their lives why are you forcing people to stay together
7400605 this legislation will provide gt thousands of texas couples the tools they need to sustain healthy marriages
7400606 thousands of texas couples get divorced gt every year because they have not had access to marriage skills building gt classes
7400607 texas will now become the nations leader in gt the effort to provide marriage and pre marital skills building classes to gt those who need it most texas also won more money in the recently allocated gt federal healthy marriage grants from the department of health and human gt services than any other state in the nation other than california
7400608 its now going to cost 60 to get married if you dont take this course
7400609 we have far too many divorces in most cases in the first three to four years of marriage
7400610 if we dont focus on keeping families together then were on a downward spiral
7400611 this house has already voted on the issue of not doubling the cost of a marriage license
7400612 how have we gone from government is not the solution to now asking government to get involved in everyday marriage
7400613 i just think the government has no business interfering in the sanctity of a marriage
7400614 there are individuals that make money off of defensive driving
7400615 a lot of people will make money off of it its terrible
7400616 nee ik had al aan de telefoon gezegd dat ik dan alleen plekken vooraan heb met etenstijd heb ik nog wel normale plekken
7400617 oh ja en je zit anders ook tussen dat grut natuurlijk wilt u om 14 10 of 13 40
7400618 het is beter om je vanaf dag n in het diepe te gooien
7400619 ive got this contract here and ill rip it up right now if you want me to
7400620 i know that you might talk to people who are going to say you bought a house why did you do that or you should have waited or real estate is not a good investment
7400621 it is likely that after today you will encounter people who suggest that you made a poor decision
7400622 if you dont want to buy this home i will tear up the contract right now
7400623 i need to know that you want to buy this home and that you are sure you want to do it
7400624 i dont want you to come back to me later on dissatisfied because i count on your referrals and endorsement to family friends and neighbors
7400625 now renegades are the people with their own philosophies they change the course of history everyday people like you and me
7400626 im a do the things that i want to do i aint got a thing to prove to you im fine and dandy with the me inside i dont give a hoot about what you think
7400627 in more open country you can shoot them from helicopters but here in the scrub rainforest you cant even see the buggers
7400628 my house real estate is the best investment ive ever made
7400629 a recent university of new orleans survey of residents found concern about levee safety was dropping off the list of top worries replaced by crime incompetent leadership and corruption
7400630 tell to the coming generation the glorious deeds of the lord and his might and the wonders that he has done that the generation to come might know even the children yet to be born that they may arise and tell them to
7400631 is now bordering on mainstream in the united states it may be the fastest growing form of education in the united states
7400632 now why are we doing this and is it really worth it
7400633 i know im his parent but really and truly this kid is gifted
7400634 i dont know whats the matter he keeps on getting cs
7400635 everybodys watching whats going on in beijing right now with the olympics think about the amount of money that china has spent on infrastructure their ports their train systems their airports are vastly the superior to us now which means if you are a corporation deciding where to do business youre starting to think beijing looks like a pretty good option
7400636 my own neighborhood is filled with the signs of a local economy being replaced by a global one small businesses being replaced by large corporations multinationals taking over the deeper i look the more i realize that in looking into these shop windows i am also looking out at the rest of the world i think this is a unique moment to document and an important one to archive i know the world will never look quite this way again and i feel that i want to look closely to hold it near
7400637 the worlds highest 14 7 megapixel 28mm wide angle lens digital camera
7400638 we were surprised to find that nearly one in five americans answered no when asked if they had life goals
7400639 this sentiment encouraged us to create our list of 27 resources that could help get people on the path to success the no 1 resource a personal list of life goals
7400640 we think we can become a very significant professional services organization to go to unified communications and broaden microsofts communication enabled applications being aligned with microsoft will help in a significant way unified communications is coming very fast people want to make investments today and we can give them confidence that they can invest now in voip and there will be many other applications ivr interactive voice response is becoming more and of a request and customers want services for it we want to be a thought leader provide unified communications and provide sip session initiation protocol applications we can really accomplish that with our innovation in the carrier space we have a strong base with next generation convergence if we execute we could be a significant player services and solutions is not a big percentage of the market we dont want to be the next ibm we have a great services organization weve been more reactive when asked by customers as opposed to marketing to them we do believe that by simply communicating with existing customers we will be able to increase our penetration significantly we think we can take a 2 billion business and double it in the next three or four years
7400641 you cant do that with that program heres one that will do what you want
7400642 i dont want to spank my children i was abused as a child and i wont go there
7400643 i have cancer my weight is the least of my problems
7400644 id rather put up with my boss and find a job quietly to keep the paycheck coming i have children to feed
7400645 it will be best for you given your circumstances if you do this
7400646 id like to watch while you did something like this
7400647 the bug should emerge from the hole after you set fire to his behind
7400648 if you want to make money in the stock market you should invest in no load mutual funds not high risk individual stocks
7400649 whether they like it or not we have to be reckoned with
7400650 its an absolute certainty that the americans wont impose any sanctions because they themselves would suffer
7400651 today i am happy to announce that linkedin has raised additional funding from our original investors and added another world class investor to our team
7400652 i cannot speak roma and i feel ashamed when i have to speak with roma musicians from all over europe in english
7400653 it is a really deep feeling of disgrace and i am working hard on learning the roma language i feel that it is my own language
7400654 a roma ngo estimates 10 to 15 percent of roma living in the czech republic do not speak their own language at all
7400655 it is just a logical trend that roma culture is changing and being influenced by culture of the majority population
7400656 i cannot say that it is bad or good it is just a logical process
7400657 music is inside of us you do not have to teach roma people that their parents and grandparents were musicians
7400658 the philosophy of our nation is to enjoy ourselves one moment and in the next cry and be sad and then again celebrate
7400659 this temperament is inside of us and is best visible in dance and music
7400660 they want indian people to be civilized but not too civilized educated but not too educated and to have money but not too much money
7400661 on the end of my 2 nd week of animal cuts this stuff gives you amazing energy and focus ive been doing 45min 1hr of cardio in the morning and then a high intensity weight routine at night and ive still managed to lose about 10lbs while keeping all of my strength i had before i started my cutting cycle will definitely buy again
7400662 they had a lot of discrimination both from students and teachers
7400663 shed come home feeling stupid im never going to learn anything
7400664 good home schooling produces children who are really capable and able to do many things children in the public schools do not
7400665 we want to be the ones that teach them about god teach them about the abcs or sex or whatever we dont want other people teaching our kids that
7400666 as indian people we seem to think that we dont have credibility to talk about ourselves
7400667 we need our white guy to step in and speak for us
7400668 we want to live among you and learn how to live happily
7400669 parents dont speak blackfoot language and grandparents also are unlikely to do so so children come here and they know english
7400670 they stay in here from eight oclock till four as soon as they come out from that door im sure they will speak english children who come here learn simply more languages at once
7400671 even though they had no english lessons here they are among the top english french or spanish students as well as math students
7400672 from the beginning they can feel something like this is a place for you we understand when you have some stops and gaps and holes and whatever in your education its ok
7400673 the other thing is that american indian students are not so happy to leave their home i speak in general but in a lot of cases its true what im saying
7400674 before the tribal colleges they could go to mainstream universities but they were too big too white too many and so we had just very few native american students staying there and graduating and being successful
7400675 the death of the american indian culture took less than 30 years after its 9 000 years of building
7400676 i sat everyone down and said you know people this is historic that weve gotten money but there will be people come the next legislative session who will want to get rid of it
7400677 you will be under a microscope for every thing you do for every dime you spend everything thats accomplished or not accomplished so you cannot fail you have to provide great materials to schools
7400678 we used to have this excuse from the schools well we dont know what resources to use so we started developing as many resources as we could and updating the ones we knew were good and getting them out to every school
7400679 the history is always written by non tribal people about themselves moving to the west or whatever and the indians were generally considered as a part of wilderness
7400680 all these histories and projects are coming from the tribes themselves saying this is what we want people to know about us
7400681 yesterday i was on a tour with my brother from wisconsin and his family
7400682 we went to the gates of the mountains the guy kept saying native american indians he was covering the whole spectrum trying to be politically correct
7400683 hopefully the iefa should help eradicate the racial aspect of it all
7400684 if you know people you dont tend to slander them as a group
7400685 a lot of indian students who live in reservation areas start school with a vocabulary about 3 000 words while the mainstream children who are from urban or suburban areas start school with vocabulary about 20 000 words
7400686 i dont know if i have a right answer but i have a few thoughts about it
7400687 the first is that parents dont read to their children as many books at an early age the second one is that we dont have as many conversations in a lot of our households
7400688 these kids live in areas that experience 60 80 unemployment theres often no reason to go to school because theres not a job when they graduate
7400689 within reservation families you have the boarding school aspect their grandparents were shuffled off to boarding school and told to be white
7400690 my friend who is a navajo told me a story that students had to mark in a test where boats go there were pictures of a river and highway and those kids where pretty continually marking the highway because kids see boats on cars on the highway theres no river in that region
7400691 we just passed in this legislature by a miracle full time kindergarten
7400692 we know that if a child cant read by the end of third grade it is virtually impossible to ever catch them up
7400693 we need to make sure our teachers get professional development in poverty issues learning in poverty is very different than learning as a middle class student
7400694 this last semester were going to put you in a government class in government 101
7400695 if you cant get the child to school they cant be educated
7400696 hey vince our web site is gorgeous and all of the information is there but what can we do to
7400697 i was literally blown away when my 14 year old daughter said daddy email is for old people
7400698 tim russert nbc news washington bureau chief and the moderator of
7400699 when somebody tried to talk to me it was someone whod been to college whod read it in a book
7400700 when you get into he sweat you get into the womb of mother earth
7400701 just being around it it takes you away from the walls and the bars makes you feel like youre at home again
7400702 i have spent most of my adult life in prison
7400703 i moved to my reservation the flathead reservation and i went to salish kootenai college
7400704 but i was drinking you know and i got into an accident nothing bad happened nobody was hurt but i was drunk
7400705 i always felt racism everywhere even among my own people
7400706 but i was also white they hated me there because i was white and white kids hated me because i was indian
7400707 to be honest i was getting into big trouble if you know what i mean
7400708 we try to make sure everyone who comes in here gets their ged general education development or the equivalent of a high school diploma
7400709 there was a lot of abuse in our family even sexual
7400710 i ran away from home a lot because nobody believed me that i was abused
7400711 white children didnt want to play with us because the parents were worried that they could catch some kind of disease from us in the gymnasium white kids had never had lockers next to us im left handed and we had a teacher who used to slap us with a ruler whenever we started to write by this hand we also werent allowed to wear moccasins to school
7400712 i started to date white ladies it was something unacceptable in 1980s now its better i have all my eight children with five different white women
7400713 im not very much in contact with my family i just spoke with my sister cathy and brother dusty im not sure if my children know exactly where i am
7400714 prison is something that changed my life really i came in for a very unpopular crime so i had quite tough time at the beginning from other inmates i came here for sexual assault
7400715 i have respect for my victims i dont want to ever try to justify myself because there is no justification but at the same time its a cycle of abuse in which i was since my childhood
7400716 i wanna leave that door open and i want to give them a chance to say to me what they want to say
7400717 if you quit drinking i will give it to you
7400718 i felt that i was losing a lot when i was leaving
7400719 my family tradition ceremonies sweat lodges drumming that has been there all the time
7400720 i was drinking alcohol a lot partying and ended up on meth
7400721 i had a lot of losses in my family and this was my way to deal with the pain
7400722 but towns offer so much there are more things to do and better schools
7400723 some guys come out and have no support there they return back to prison
7400724 some of the prisoners dont feel its like a temporary stop but home
7400725 when the prisoners come out of the prison its very hard for them to start the new life if they dont have the support from the family
7400726 they call me a gray belly because we wear gray uniforms
7400727 it will illuminate what fountainbridges most famous former milkman thinks of many aspects of scottish culture and life including sport architecture and of course the gothic tendency in scots literature
7400728 lisa i am very sorry to say youre single no more as i have spoken to your daddy therefore i would like to marry you
7400729 this is the best present ever im so happy ive never been so happy im going to have a cheesy grin on my face today and its not going off
7400730 we had to get away from the reservation so we could save ourselves
7400731 its so hard because its so dangerous what can happen to us if we start to drink and start to lose our goals
7400732 a lot of things that work for the western culture dont work for indians
7400733 because you have the support of other people but they tell you you need to be selfish you need to focus on yourself you need to quit for yourself they say dont try to quit drinking or doing drugs for someone else do it for yourself but thats the western culture what motivates me to go to school is other people its not really something im doing for myself its something im doing because they need it we really need it and i want to do it for someone else
7400734 when youre from a small town and nobody expects you to go to college anyway they dont teach you those things
7400735 we have to fight for affordable housing for health care and against racism
7400736 we want fair and equal treatment for everybody not just us
7400737 its been my experience that people are not deliberately ignorant a lot of times they just dont know
7400738 i remember going to the missoula wal mart one night my daughter was with me i was just wandering around and as i was wandering everywhere i went i noticed that this girl was there and she was doing inventory or something and then i started deliberately going different places and i cant remember what part of the store it was but i circled back around her and she was looking looking looking looking i told her here i am she turned around and she dropped her clipboard and i just said i just want you to know if you lose me again i am going over here to shoes and she stopped following me
7400739 people think we dont pay taxes we just sit at home and get welfare checks every month or we have free medical care
7400740 free health care who wants it its really really bad
7400741 and we pay for it we pay for it with our health
7400742 many people go to the city just to be in the city
7400743 they believe in finding a better job they are excited about the city but the reservation is their home they have family buried there they want to be there being around elders to give my kids this experience that is why i came back
7400744 get educated get careers and be individualistic the most shameful thing was to stay on the reservation when i was leaving at age 17 i swore never again but i was really homesick
7400745 it is graced by the bear paw mountains which provide a dramatic contrast to the flat bottomlands of this area
7400746 we decided that what we went through as children we didnt want to go through with our children
7400747 we never drank we never had alcohol in the house
7400748 they ask me what are you going back to school for
7400749 but some of them dont see the economic value in education
7400750 theres an obligation to your family that you have to come back and help out
7400751 it took us seven years to get the tribes to want to work with us
7400752 weve had reservation leaders tell us youve turned your back on your own youre trying to live in a world that doesnt even want you
7400753 i will always remind people that i know where i come from
7400754 as urbans we really need to show that we remember where we come from
7400755 is that it treats you just like a human you know white black gay transvestite they dont care what you look like what you are
7400756 theres somehow more a sense of beauty being poor with all your friends and family than being poor on the outside it has its greatness but sometimes its not as good as it could be
7400757 when i said that i would never never go back i guess i didnt really mean that right now i would never go back no way
7400758 people still ask me and i have to tell them that i was not born in a teepee down by the river my mother was in the army my father was in the air force
7400759 everything became a sin even bubble gum was a sin and i love bubble gum to this day
7400760 my grandfather told me you are a cheyenne and you need to know your language and he stopped talking to me in english and that is how i learned i would listen to him and go and point things to find out what he was talking about
7400761 i didnt want to live at home in lame deer because there is no place to work no place to live
7400762 and you know with tribal politics sometimes that can be really insecure depending on who runs for office and who gets elected
7400763 my kids were at school and i did not want them to pull them out and take them back
7400764 i really didnt care about small town living i never did although it is odd now because i live in lolo which is a small town everybody knows everybody and that is what i left
7400765 i came to montana peoples action in 1980 as a member
7400766 that people were focusing on the tribes but only on reservations issues people looked at us and said oh janet i really support sovereignty water rights hunting rights and i said all right and where do you stand on affordable housing what about public education why are we building more prisons than schools people were really surprised that we cared about that
7400767 in some tribes if a woman is married to a medicine man no other man can touch her and then she goes in for an exam and there is a male nurse then she has to say no
7400768 the first one is that indian women 18 24 years of age who become hiv positive in montana often get it from their boyfriends and husbands
7400769 cultural traditions are so important and it is not just about indians we have other large minorities here fair and equal treatment of everybody not just us discrimination is discrimination is discrimination and it is wrong
7400770 i use the term indian because that is how i always used to call myself i heard people said native american american indian indigenous i am an indian you can call me whatever you like as long as you do it with respect
7400771 before my grandfather died he told me whatever you do wherever you go always remember that you are a cheyenne
7400772 you have nothing you just have to hope you dont get sick
7400773 if i broke my leg or had a heart attack i would jump into my car drive eight or nine hours to my reservation and stay there for six months to get access to healthcare
7400774 this idea of free health care is all about people who think there is somebody else eating a bigger piece of pie than they are we are not even getting a pie we are all getting crumbs it just turns us against each other
7400775 i was young about 20 and i was at a meeting with this coal company and we came there with crow
7400776 like trying to put sand of a beach with a teaspoon
7400777 they business owners dont bring businesses here because we dont have a police force
7400778 as far as were concerned class iii gaming is not a concern
7400779 what the salish and kootenai are trying to do is be more dynamic
7400780 this business is about lot of networking and knowing people
7400781 didnt know how to raise their own children because they werent raised up in a family themselves
7400782 i lived with my family first but we didnt have a very good relationship my parents were alcoholics
7400783 the other inmate whom we talked to left his family and school at the age of fourteen and claimed his family didnt care about it recently he met two of his sons in the prison he is currently in for his fourth time
7400784 are we the same roma who rob you on the street
7400785 we are quite happy for these apartments really but how can my children integrate to the majority when they have no contact with it and have no idea at all
7400786 imagine more than 50 children playing in front of the house so noisy and we know that this is something the emergency clinic wasnt happy about either but where else can the kids play
7400787 the officers made criteria for example the amount of debt reliability paying rent or sending children to school
7400788 we needed to evaluate those families who asked for flats in the city we obviously do not have that many flats
7400789 the state of houses they were forced to move to is the same as that of pavla the old building
7400790 this is forever you know not just for a while but for a whole life
7400791 i plan to go to sheffield england and earn some money there
7400792 then i will leave this place i want a better life for my children
7400793 they do not live in families as we understand the word family they live in extended families about 10 to 20 people in one
7400794 this work is very frustrating you see one step forward and three steps backwards but it is necessary to do something this problem is already a crisis
7400795 when they say they want to leave this place and live among white people they partly tell the truth but partly they are happy how they are now together in one place
7400796 whoever solves this problem or eliminates these tensions should receive a nobel prize
7400797 we like it here after the flood we took care of each other and it continues we have learned how to behave and make no enemies
7400798 for me there is no real tradition in living in big families it is just a question of habit
7400799 there is definitely no racism there used to be at the beginning but that man left this place he simply was not willing to live here his fault
7400800 you ask me why just look at them they are dressed up like you are they speak perfect czech and english and they want to study
7400801 whoever is evil is evil i hate bad people violence makes no sense
7400802 if my kids see that the other kids are at home studying or doing homework they would go home too they need a good example to follow
7400803 but when living among non romas among g d os i would be ashamed to be pointed out as somebody who is dirty unclean or causes problems
7400804 we are somehow forcing them to live like we do
7400805 it would definitely be much easier if they will do that but they feel threatened by this pressure they feel like theyre being cornered and they stop trusting the society they live in and what you do when you feel you are being cornered you attack it is true that they buy things they have no money for that is because they are in such debt that they do not care they dont see a way out
7400806 look at us are we the same roma who rob you on the street and do you think i was never robbed by a roma of course i was and i told him what i think about him i did
7400807 living segregated is a way to solve the problem we have with the roma community but only only if we are able to create working possibilities for them but a really ideal solution is to spread these people out to places where they will live surrounded by others
7400808 media should transfer complete information but for the media it is more attractive to write about things that are negative what does the media write about about a young roma girl who won taekwondo world championships or about romas in vset n who damaged a house there should be both of them according to my opinion
7400809 i think 90 percent of czech people create their opinion of the world according to the media coverage of events so i ask myself if my job is really important i ll do four good programs that will help 100 people but then i come home and watch romas presented as bad people
7400810 freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor it must be demanded by the oppressed
7400811 our study shows for the first time the surprising speed with which humans make body fat from fructose
7400812 all three can be made into triglycerides a form of body fat however once you start the process of fat synthesis from fructose its hard to slow it down
7400813 its basically sneaking into the rock concert through the fence
7400814 its a less controlled movement of fructose through these pathways that causes it to contribute to greater triglyceride synthesis the bottom line of this study is that fructose very quickly gets made into fat in the body
7400815 the message from this study is powerful because body fat synthesis was measured immediately after the sweet drinks were consumed
7400816 the carbohydrates came into the body as sugars the liver took the molecules apart like tinker toys and put them back together to build fats
7400817 this is an underestimate of the effect of fructose because these individuals consumed the drinks while fasting and because the subjects were healthy lean and could presumably process the fructose pretty quickly fat synthesis from sugars may be worse in people who are overweight or obese because this process may be already revved up
7400818 there are lots of people out there who want to demonize fructose as the cause of the obesity epidemic
7400819 i think it may be a contributor but its not the only problem americans are eating too many calories for their activity level were overeating fat were overeating protein and were overeating all sugars
7400820 more dental schools are experimenting with simulation as a way to teach
7400821 ideally it is not that we are out to prove that virtual worlds or the vicsr system is better than standard instruction but that they are of equal value
7400822 virtual patients have much to offer in training healthcare providers and it is equally important to explore how interactive virtual reality technology can enhance assessment of competency
7400823 our journal will be a catalyst for turning outstanding science into actions that will improve health and healthcare
7400824 as a profession we are manifesting remarkable advances in our ability to prevent and treat cardiovascular disease and yet we see marked gaps in our ability to provide safe effective efficient equitable timely and patient centered care
7400825 there is a need for scholarship to promote improvements in cardiovascular health and healthcare focusing on the end results of our efforts
7400826 our journal will be multidisciplinary in its orientation and will welcome contributions that bring into focus the methods of a wide range of fields as they apply to outcomes research
7400827 i am very pleased with the release of the latest in our new line of subspecialty journals and with its new editor dr harlan krumholz
7400828 with his leadership this journal is poised to become a leading voice in the cardiovascular outcomes community
7400829 quantitative qualitative mixed methods economic and health policy research among others will be welcome
7400830 to be competitive for publication the research questions must be strong and consequential and the methods and writing should be outstanding
7400831 todays seizure action shows that fda will take enforcement action to protect the public from dietary supplements that contain prescription drug ingredients that are potentially harmful to consumers
7400832 fda will not tolerate a companys failure to take voluntary action to protect the public health after being given the opportunity by fda to do so
7400833 california is a leader in promoting health and nutrition and i am pleased to continue that tradition by being the first state in the nation to phase out trans fats
7400834 consuming trans fat is linked to coronary heart disease and today we are taking a strong step toward creating a healthier future for california
7400835 like saturated fat trans fat also raises the low density lipoprotein ldl or
7400836 children who start at age three or four eating a steady diet of fast food pop tarts commercially prepared fish sticks stick margarine cake candy cookies and microwave popcorn can be expected to get heart disease earlier than kids who are eating foods without trans fats some of our research here at the university of maryland has shown that kids as young as eight nine and 10 already have the high cholesterol and blood fats that clog arteries by starting healthy eating habits early parents can help their children avoid heart attacks and stroke
7400837 another major change in the dietary recommendations is a lower goal for saturated fat from less than 10 percent to less than seven percent and establishing a goal for trans fatty acids of less than one percent of total calories
7400838 our results show that at least for urinary tract infections cranberry juice targets the right bacteria those that cause disease but has no effect on non pathogenic organisms suggesting that cranberry juice will not disrupt bacteria that are part of the normal flora in the gut
7400839 we have also shown that this effect occurs at concentrations of cranberry juice that are comparable to levels we would expect to find in the urinary tract
7400840 when we takes e coli bacteria that have been treated with cranberry juice and place them in normal growth media they regain the ability to adhere to urinary tract cells
7400841 this suggests that to realize the antibacterial benefits of cranberry one must consume cranberry juice regularly perhaps daily
7400842 thats good news for people who do not like to consume a lot of sugary juice
7400843 i felt ashamed and humiliated and i still do to this day
7400844 i dont really understand why the government is not responding other than general racism
7400845 i am angry at the government because i dont think theyre doing anything about it
7400846 the government overall tries to ignore the problem they are afraid of this issue because if they come with a decision they dont know how many people could be affected
7400847 in the delivery room they brought a piece of paper and said i had to sign it or i would die
7400848 at the time i was in great pain i didnt care about anything i just wanted the pain to stop so i took the pen and signed the paper
7400849 i was sad and kept thinking about this for the next 14 years
7400850 always when i saw little children or a stroller i would start to cry
7400851 be proud of being roma you have a rich culture
7400852 youll be a doctor and youll be a lawyer is that clear
7400853 when im on the streets i dont go sweat every weekend but i have spent most of my life here
7400854 the problem is their low ambitions so its the best thing society can offer them
7400855 they dont feel to be roma they feel to be czech
7400856 the doors have been shut some many times in your face that you dont believe in anything anymore
7400857 they collect data and write reports but they never take action
7400858 in past years it was mainly tourists who were taking pictures and following the parade but this year i saw many roma people including their babies
7400859 it is a show for children as well as adults it made me happy
7400860 so that some of the less famous roma groups would have a chance to show their skills and further their musical development nowadays we have a bunch of foreign groups and one or two czech groups it should be changed
7400861 it is all about contacts but we already have had interviews and songs played on czech radio and on roma radio rota we did not get to private radio stations yet once we had an offer to make a video clip but we did not have enough money to create a good one which we would be proud of
7400862 khamoro was established with the aim of preserving what roma people are best known for in the world music in its traditional form it lets one get a glimpse of roma culture get to know its values and understand them
7400863 in the media you can find references to roma as either brilliant musicians or as thieves and social welfare abusers
7400864 three of five patients ask for traditional healing methods and the assistance of a medicine man
7400865 when we mapped out the pa subunit it looked very much like the head of a dragon
7400866 one domain looked like the dragons brains and the other looked like its mouth
7400867 if we can put a bit in the dragons mouth we can slow or even potentially someday stop the spread of avian flu
7400868 since we are talking about a relatively small protein surface area finding a way to inhibit rna replication in h5n1 seems very feasible
7400869 most published medical papers are available on the internet in a pdf format now
7400870 for radiologists these electronic papers provide richer information e g various cases reviews and abundant valuable images than conventional textbooks and can be easily found and downloaded for further reading via online databases however managing pdf files is troublesome and it is difficult to find software designed for organizing them
7400871 one day i just happened to drag and drop a pdf into itunes and was surprised to find that it was supported by itunes this means that you can search describe and rate pdfs just like you do the music files
7400872 we no longer need to keep pdf files in redundant folders
7400873 the main reason children are put in practical elementary schools is that they arent successful at elementary schools they have bad marks and a psychologist suggests that they go to our school but parents must agree with this
7400874 just a few pupils go directly to our school for their first year they usually begin at a regular elementary school and then when they have troubles they change schools
7400875 the kid isnt for example able to count to 10 but when you take out 2 bottles he or she will say ok there are 2 bottles each one costs 2 crowns so together ive got 4 crowns as you can see the kid is able to count its just a matter of how he or she is approached
7400876 roma parents from around pe ky are simply used to sending their kids there
7400877 we teach children with learning disabilities such as dyslexia dysgraphia or dyscalculia
7400878 this means that some of them have troubles with reading others with writing or orientation in numbers so we need to explain things to them individually and each one in a different way
7400879 its common for our teachers to give parents their cell phone number so they can be reached at any time they can even visit parents at home if they arent able to go to school
7400880 there are kids at practical elementary school who have troubles with czech language for example and are behind the others so they can go to a special school just for czech language lessons and remain in practical school for the rest of their classes
7400881 we re growing up with the consciousness that nobody wants us
7400882 the owner put him at the front of the shop and we were a bit concerned that he would be discriminated against by the shop visitors instead he was so good that regular customers began requesting only the meat that he had cut
7400883 sometimes its very hard when theres a kid that started to go to special or practical school at the age of 6 and really doesnt fit there its very difficult to transfer him or her into regular elementary school because the education level of children from special or practical school is lower
7400884 if i go with my grandfather to build houses ill make half a million crowns in five years
7400885 the children are sort of brought up by the institutions thinking they are not as good as others
7400886 this is patrik hes 11 years old he has three more siblings and hes the eldest one so he needs to take care of them because their mother died last year he picks them up from kindergarten for example
7400887 i just came to tell you that were not going to the gallery
7400888 my sister caught the flu so were not able to go sorry
7400889 there is no need for children to register in our center they just come when they want to but i keep a record of their attendance just in case the police come to investigate some crime then they can see that a child was in our center and wasnt able to commit it
7400890 the tradition of education in these families is very low and they simply dont believe that better education can help their children to get better position but we believe that education could help those people and their kids so we try to offer adults retraining courses and support their kids in the learning process
7400891 we found a lot of students who wanted to be tutors but nobody who wanted to be helped even after we distributed five thousand leaflets advertising the program
7400892 i need graduation exams to be recognized as a proper and fully qualified social worker and to have a better income
7400893 we had to put a seven year old boy into a youth home he has been addicted to sniffing glue for one year his mother agreed with it because she saw it was the best for the boy to move somewhere else where he could have better living conditions
7400894 they dont even know how to turn on a computer
7400895 i noticed that when you have two children with light learning disabilities then it really depends on his or her parents if he or she attends the standard elementary school or practical one
7400896 when i came home after passing through the entrance exams to a bachelor program called adult education at jan amos komensky university prague my parents burst into tears they were so proud of me for being accepted to study at university it was a private one so i needed money for it but they told me dont be worried well manage that and so my father who was a worker at a railway station and was already old enough to retire continued to go to work during my bachelor studies and even worked harder and during weekends
7400897 and do you know that theyll need to repeat this year if you want to put them into regular elementary school and not a practical one
7400898 we all come from musical families and even we did not want to play this old traditional roma music
7400899 if you are forced to play some instrument you usually run away and hold on to some other one
7400900 sometimes if our wider family meets we play some traditional roma music it is inside of us but i would rather play latino jazz or rock music
7400901 the situation in the cities is much different nowadays young people still care about music but in the way that they watch trendy musical channels they are emulating pop stars following them and trying to be just like them
7400902 i think that it is a natural evolution in society
7400903 to me it raises real red flags that such a disproportionate number of indians are incarcerated

7400961 what copyrights protect is the expression of an idea rather than the idea itself
7400962 i think theres a very fine line to walk in this one and the question is whether scrabulous went over the line or not in mimicking the colors or everything else
7400963 or whether they couldve designed a generic version of the game with the same points system and scoring system and that wouldve fallen out of hasbros copyrights
7400964 the name socialmedian itself represents what we believe to be the next evolution of media as information becomes more universally accessible and people socially can create share and discuss it online what were witnessing is a massive democratization of information around the globe as people who share common interests can instantly become newsmakers for each other without any regard to political borders or boundaries increasingly when it comes to news and information its no longer about the haves and have nots we are all the social median

7400984 it is a business dispute between former partners the suit is baseless
7400985 there was a concern that hunter bidens role as a lobbyist would have an impact on the senators proposed presidential run
7400986 thats what james biden told mr lotito was it true who knows there is no allegation the senator was involved in any of these events

7401125 sure guy just stop by the station over there in the morning and ask for jim ill let him know youre coming by i owe you one noir
7401126 you must be the pi cousin frank said was coming over jim kirby
7401127 he said sure it was a small town fund raiser but that was by far the best plate of enchiladas hed ever had
7401128 the class of 1857s class letters had provided me with a general idea about her death some time after october 4 1862 but not more than a couple weeks i cant get any farther than that though do you think you can help me
7401129 put the arsenic in the enchiladas hell never know what hit him hahahahaha
7401130 the very last time i will let the parrot ride the tricycle
7401131 keke palmer plays jasmine and saves this feel good sports dramedy from veering too sharply into sappy territory
7401132 n o tem nada mais brasileiro do que churrasco de frango cerveja e praia
7401133 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world athletes from 204 national olympic committees came to these dazzling venues and awed us with their talent
7401134 new stars were born stars from past games amazed us again we shared their joys and their tears and we marveled at their ability we will long remember the achievements we witnessed here
7401135 you have shown us the unifying power of sport the olympic spirit lives in the warm embrace of competitors from nations in conflict keep that spirit alive when you return home
7401136 it was like i never pitched before im disgusted with my outing
7401137 she beat talent and she won all of them back
7401138 ill try to do more great things break my own records maybe and just do wonderful things the world championship is coming up next year may be i can do the same there but i dont know but im looking forward to it
7401139 i dont know what ill be doing when it comes it comes but right now im just focussed on just enjoying myself right now im tired and im just going to try and enjoy myself
7401140 i dont think its fully sunken yet now you know i think over the next few days few weeks few months and few years itll really fully sink in and i have no idea what im going to do and what its going to feel like but i had some moments where ive choked up a little bit and just to look back at everything thats happening its just exciting
7401141 were in a situation where we have to completely rebuild a bullpen from scratch and thats what were doing
7401142 well start with closer joel hanrahan on the back end but continue with estrada and mock and there will be a couple more who come up here and do the same thing so there are going to be growing pains with that theres an adjustment period
7401143 we just cant fit every one of our prospects in our starting rotation
7401144 were getting him into baseball shape right now full steam
7401145 since weve been here the last four years he had no velocity never got it to 90
7401146 we are hopeful that he will be able to contribute to the nationals major league team in september
7401147 when i got to the ballpark i just started feeling weird in my stomach
7401148 i had to throw up and that kind of stuff thats not an excuse but i dont have it i dont have it today
7401149 hes been giving us innings plain and simple you dont have innings out of your starters and then your bullpen is a mess
7401150 when youre facing a lineup like they have and playing in this ballfield you just cant be playing with fire for so long sooner or later they were going to get him
7401151 hes wearing some thumb guards and stuff to try to help him out
7401152 hes feeling a lot better especially from the right side
7401153 it doesnt mean hes going to be out there every day
7401154 people writing about it everywhere losing 12 in a row and whatnot we just had to get that one and see where it takes us
7401155 he hadnt had a chance to save a ballgame in two weeks
7401156 i dont think it would be too much to ask him for a two inning save to snap out of it
7401157 that was unbelievable words cant say how great that was
7401158 i didnt feel well i was trying to talk myself up to get ready for the game but here i was im dying
7401159 i didnt go to sleep or anything but just being around the guys that picked me up
7401160 but we just kept fighting yeah it was tough for us but this is our job and this is what we have to do it wasnt just tough for me it was tough for everybody in here but everybody came out today and we battled all day long
7401161 how about you go play with gus and let me handle dinner
7401162 we sent them to columbus so they can work out out there
7401163 its mostly the fact that you dont need to throw the ball 100 miles per hour to win ballgames
7401164 its a little sore but ive got to play today
7401165 every fly ball people are getting up people are getting up to buy hot dogs and beer
7401166 dont eat anything that your grandmother wouldnt recognize as food
7401167 when you dont take care of your things you lose them
7401168 too much hope on sthing will result a greater fall
7401169 third party software that modifies processor operating characteristics such as frequency and voltage is not supported and should be removed before installing this update
7401170 its extremely important not to walk guys regardless of whether youre a ground ball or fly ball pitcher
7401171 but in this stadium and with the lineup they have you dont want to be walking guys when you walk guys the home runs hurt you more
7401172 you know how many fastballs up in the zone he threw a lot
7401173 but he strikes a lot of guys out its power stuff the first three innings he threw like one breaking ball all of his fastballs were up in the zone and he was getting guys to chase them
7401174 we are at a critical point in our time where we can either educate or incarcerate
7401175 we can teach them now or run the risk of possible incarceration later on in life i dont want to see the latter
7401176 students and parents must understand that attending school is not optional
7401177 when they fail to attend school they are breaking the law
7401178 were all for keeping kids in school and we applaud any efforts to make that happen
7401179 but the privacy issue what happens with the bracelet or anklet after school is out is that appropriate for the school or courts to know where and what this person is doing outside of school
7401180 sometimes as i said students are runaways parents dont know where they are
7401181 so its for the safety of the child as well as the safety of the community
7401182 support the prudent and calibrated use of all instruments of united states national power in iraq including diplomatic economic intelligence and military instruments in support of the policy with respect to the government of the islamic republic of iran and its proxies
7401183 the united states should designate the islamic revolutionary guards corps as a foreign terrorist organization and place the islamic revolutionary guards corps on the list of specially designated global terrorists
7401184 iran through the use of the iranian republican guard corps quds force seeks to turn the shiia militia extremists into a hezbollah like force to serve its interests and fight a proxy war against the iraqi state and coalition forces in iraq
7401185 the political power of the occupiers the united states and allied foreign forces in iraq is collapsing rapidly soon we will see a huge power vacuum in the region of course we are prepared to fill the gap
7401186 biden said the best deterrent to prevent pre emptive military action in iran is to make it clear even if it is at the end of his final term action will be taken against bush to ensure his legacy will be marred for all time
7401187 how many signs do you need that the ruling elite care not for your opinions
7401188 after the democratic national convention ends there will be hundreds of marijuana cases all showing up at the same time
7401189 its certainly not our function to vote on suspending laws for a certain period of time
7401190 if something occurs in front of us were going to act
7401191 i think the fear is that somehow large corporations will censor their content their points of view right
7401192 i think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy which by the way would have a big first amendment problem
7401193 then whoever is in charge of government is going to determine what is fair under a so called fairness doctrine which wont be called that itll be called something else
7401194 so will web sites will bloggers have to give equal time or equal space on their web site to opposing views rather than letting the marketplace of ideas determine that
7401195 the fairness doctrine has not been raised at the fcc but the importance of this election is in part has something to do with that
7401196 so you know this election if it goes one way we could see a re imposition of the fairness doctrine there is a discussion of it in congress i think it wont be called the fairness doctrine by folks who are promoting it i think it will be called something else and i think itll be intertwined into the net neutrality debate
7401197 ive got to get it down in the zone every pitch instead of five out of 10 or whatever it is
7401198 hes in a little bit of a funk right now and i just want to get him back in some kind of rhythm
7401199 a little late getting in a hitting position and the ball is beating him a little bit
7401200 it feels good you know because somebody wanted you for something
7401201 thats neat lemme buy that too and make a note of it
7401202 thank god i didnt bother to recycle that dumb old plastic water bottle think of all the time that would have taken me away from my main pursuit of concocting sustainable methods of being the hippest navel gazer on the planet
7401203 i wont always place my empty water bottles in the recycling bin why because frankly its a pain and theres nothing fun about it
7401204 garbage dumps will be the gold mines of the future
7401205 most of the time i use an indoor drying rack i keep mine in my gacky furnace room where it is warm and theres space to hog up that nobody else wants to occupy
7401206 you know you can use a thermos too you dont need a special appliance
7401207 but i mean we had the lead and bergmann was pitching very good and we thought we had a very good chance today to snap out of it
7401208 we just couldnt close it out couldnt finish them off
7401209 it is very fun because from some places in the stadium you can see the capitol we have a big scoreboard and we have the red white and blue colors which represent the nationals and the united states of america
7401210 its a lot of electricity you feel the fans the lights are shining down on you it gives you that feeling where you just want to do your best at all times
7401211 its different when you come to a team and dont know anybody
7401212 we feel that for us to have him sitting here on the bench wed rather send him down there
7401213 no thanks id rather just move on and not talk about it
7401214 for us to try to get something back instead of him just walking with no compensation is a position we have to take
7401215 hes a quality kid who can play short and second base good defensive player
7401216 it gives us a lot of depth now especially at shortstop
7401217 guys want to catch the ball want to hit the ball and they want to throw strikes theyre just not doing it right now
7401218 in a streak like this you expect a ball like that to go over the wall because everything is going wrong
7401219 when were in a little stretch like this everybodys trying to give it their all and youre like ive got to do it instead of almost like im gonna do it
7401220 you just get up there and you want to get it done so bad sometimes it ends up working against you
7401221 they made it very difficult to engage they wouldnt speak by phone
7401222 if the redskins played this way you wouldnt see such patient fans at fedex
7401223 there is nothing like being at a baseball game on a night like this
7401224 i go to nearly all the games and understand you have to give the club time to get it right
7401225 at some point theyre going to have to buy two serious hitters
7401226 the starting pitching is good and they have some core players
7401227 the young guys are learning and were getting some good players in the draft
7401228 this organization is a terrorist organization and created mayhem against the public life so we decided to declare it banned
7401229 anyone having link with this organization promoting its literature and message helping it financially or in any other way will be taken to task according to the law
7401230 we gave them a final offer at 10 30 p m
7401231 we said heres a final take it or leave it offer of 3 million which we later moved to 3 3 million and then verbally at the last minute we went to 3 5 million which was our final offer by phone at 11 59 at the buzzer the last e mail offer we sent them was 3 3 million
7401232 they wanted an out of the box deal we gave them an out of the box deal we tried to understand where they were coming from we tried to value the player properly and we tried to negotiate a contract to sign the player but that being said were not going to be bullied into just giving a number just because someone says youve got to pay x we have to negotiate a contract that is consistent with the value of the player and consistent with what the marketplace is paying at the time we negotiate the deal
7401233 well its just a play that got away from me
7401234 the ball was hit pretty good you know the hardest ball to judge is the one thats right at you and the one thats waist level you either have to break back or break forward i chose to break forward
7401235 the play is over its over with done we lost the game
7401236 its one of those situations where we should have won this game 3 1 the second home run to brad hawpe should never have happened i thought the team played well today
7401237 i made my point i think we should have won the game
7401238 the most frustrating is when you know the inning should have been over and you give up runs to guys who shouldnt have been at the plate like i said its just one of those situations where i thought we played a real good game as a team its just unfortunate that one play changed the whole outcome in a one run ballgame
7401239 they are stuck on making a major league contract offer
7401240 i think weve demonstrated amply our willingness to be flexible but not much interest into being bullied into something unreasonable
7401241 im not anticipating that a couple days is just going to completely take care of it
7401242 and were unable to sign aaron crow our first round pick
7401243 we would have signed for 4 0 million and made them that offer they said no
7401244 we stepped up and went to 3 5 million in an attempt to sign him and unfortunately we couldnt get it done
7401245 i think weve demonstrated amply our willingness to be flexible but not much interest into being bullied into something unreasonable
7401246 9b selection that will ensure them two picks in the top half of the first round
7401247 with all the injuries theyve had you have to give them slack
7401248 it doesnt matter if youre anaheim or chicago or us or whatever if the team you went to spring training with is not your team
7401249 if they werent willing to do that they shouldnt have drafted him im disappointed they took him they continue to tell us theyll draft 9b next year
7401250 your job is to show up and win every day
7401251 listen i still love playing it whether weve lost 10 in a row or won 10 in a row
7401252 he might be monotone but once the door is closed hes a leader
7401253 hes one of the guys everybody looks up to even though hes one of the youngest
7401254 a bunch of 30 year olds on one year contracts
7401255 were many pieces away in terms of contending when it comes down to it its a business if youre playing a team with a 120 million payroll theyre getting paid all that money for a reason
7401256 i warm up the same way every day whether weve won 10 in a row or lost 10 in a row thats why so many baseball guys are like not boring but nobody wants to say anything too radical like can you imagine if
7401257 i need to throw a strike to get the guy to swing
7401258 i dont even know what was going on i just didnt have anything today just wasnt there mentally i dont know what it was but it cant happen again
7401259 its accurate to say the deadline hasnt been reached yet thats all i can say
7401260 i think weve demonstrated amply our willingness to be flexible but not much interest into being bullied into something unreasonable
7401261 im still happy to have a team theyre going to get better i believe that
7401262 winning is not your first priority just following a team when they win whats the point
7401263 i already knew you wanted a southwest chicken salad glass of water
7401264 but the thing gooden had was that incredible hook curveball the thing this kid has is the incredible heat
7401265 can you imagine him going to a team like washington
7401266 who knows if he stays healthy he could be in the majors later that 2009 season when you have an arm like his you tend to move fast through the organization that signs you i believe his experience here in the olympics will accelerate his climb to the majors like he has afterburners on him
7401267 the consensus number one overall pick if his performance in the 2009 college season stays the same
7401268 a lot obviously can change in the next 10 months but strasburg is the clear front runner to go number one overall
7401269 hes the most consistently dominant college starter since jered weaver who came out of long beach state in 2004 and his stuff is a lot better than weavers
7401270 you guys were judging milledge in may and i bet its different than the way youre judging him today
7401271 you have to remember how you feel because its not going to last all year
7401272 i liked the trade from the beginning and i will always be behind that trade
7401273 i dont think were going to sit down this year and evaluate that trade and say hey we got the best out of it or anything because thats not what trades are all about good trades are about hurting both sides them not wanting to give him up and us giving up two good players too
7401274 the combination of any belief or practice with christian belief and or practice which is objectively incompatible with christian truth in the context of culture
7401275 guardian of the line is objective truth not culture 1991 28
7401276 the gospel had become completely conformed to jewish culture and the church had drifted to a particular rather than a universal vision of evangelism
7401277 an ongoing response that sees the gospel as outside culture the message of salvation not from west to east but from god to peoples in all cultures
7401278 in such communities the usual assumption is that there is value in similarity and danger in diversity
7401279 a syncretistic free church is an eschatological hope not a reality

7401596 for those guys to do such a good job that we qualify first and second and finish first and second is amazing it wasnt as easy as i wanted it to be but it worked out in the end
7401597 the good news is i never put a wheel off the asphalt i never locked wheels i was just pushing
7401598 it was an interesting situation it paid off and it was a lot of fun sometimes conserving fuel is the worst thing to do we didnt conserve fuel at all we just kept pushing
7401599 i mean racing is about going fast not going slow
7401600 obviously you do whatever you can to finish on the podium but people are telling you on the radio that you have to hit a certain fuel number drive slow but be fast dont get passed it doesnt make any sense
7401601 i dont know why we stayed out when the car in front of us is three seconds slower and we cant make up any track position
7401602 everything we did was wrong we lost a ton of points this is a race thats very tough unfortunately we got the bad end of the stick
7401603 as soon as i jumped in the car it was fantastic
7401604 it was exactly the same way weve always prepared the cars
7401605 its any teams fear that something like that could happen hats off to the team its not like we were around the corner here from north carolina it wasnt an easy turnaround
7401606 i think we were lucky that we already had cars here from the test last week that helped a lot but the guys worked hard it comes down to preparation in the shop we were prepared for the next races and we were prepared to get these cars turned around

7401611 there are plenty of hacked company databases for sale online but the sheer volume and quality of the information thats been stolen in the best western raid makes this particularly rare
7401612 again though i ask what do we do with these men and yes women who have served what
7401613 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time
7401614 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
7401615 again though i ask what do we do with these men and yes women who have served what

7401696 the chinese authorities and the ioc had an opportunity to demonstrate but in most respects they failed to deliver forced evictions detention of activists and restrictions on journalists should not blight another olympics

7401708 if we didnt blog people would start to wonder about us
7401709 its a phenomenal promotion vehicle for a company or a great crisis tool or a great customer service tool
7401710 were trying to be as open and disclose as much information as we can
7401711 we gave a very loud voice to the people who said they werent happy about this decision
7401712 the blog at least helps people see how we think about it
7401713 thats the importance of public relations of advertising of everything we do
7401714 it is the virtual substitute for bill marriott visiting every hotel
7401715 i tried to steer him away from the broadcasters because of the difficulty you have in taking on broadcasters in spectrum matters
7401716 what our next generation communications program is looking at is developing the technologies that could dynamically redistribute the allocated spectrum where the radios and equipment would listen to see if the spectrum is being used and if not use it
7401717 the prototype tests up to this point have consistently shown failure
7401718 that doesnt give us a whole lot of comfort when theres a potential of thousands or millions of these devices operating without any protection to ensure that our broadcasters are able to get clear picture to our viewers
7401719 the truth of the matter is if this were a straight engineering consideration you could do substantially higher than
7401720 this is a political situation as well as the question as to what is comfortable for the fcc
7401721 there werent many models where you could go to do this i did it intuitively i have four people in the office and five people at the house and i dont even have a job why it takes that many people to sustain me is hard to explain they have been with me for a long time which makes things run smoothly because they know my habits and predilections

7401727 regardless of what software you use clipmate will supercharge the windows clipboard as you cut copy and paste information youll find yourself using clipmate often as you use your computer youll wonder how you ever got along without clipmate
7401728 the windows clipboard should have been designed to do what clipmate does but it wasnt and doesnt clipmate makes the windows clipboard complete in its functionality as a utility clipmate is a great tool
7401729 i think text to speech software is fun useful and amazing technology for your personal computer
7401730 when i was developing civil war quotes notes and facts i used textaloud v1 0 to help me proofread what i had written about the civil war it was a great help to hear my words spoken aloud and i was able to make many corrections and rewordings somehow my eyes would skip over mistakes but textaloud always revealed them to me i think textaloud is worthwhilesoftware and recommend it
7401731 we wanted to play much better to open up the stadium but it didnt happen they outplayed us tonight
7401732 offensively we didnt have a lot of rhythm but we didnt have the ball a lot
7401733 in the second half we had a chance to get back in it but the turnovers really took the wind out of our sails
7401734 he handled the information we got in and out it was a noisy game and it could have been noisier but we got off to that good start
7401735 the touchdown was a plus but it could have been a whole lot better
7401736 weve got to get back to protecting the ball like the colts normally do
7401737 i told the team after the game that this was kind of a normal nfl game
7401738 if you could keep from turning the ball over and can win the turnover battle youll have a real good chance of

7401746 right now there are three mccain yard signs that arent spoken for and they cant tell me when i can get more
7401747 weve done it before were a couple of cycles ahead of them on the ground game thats why theyre spending so much money
7401748 sir can i help you update your voter registration or sign up for a mail in ballot
7401749 in the past in the days of the three networks it was necessary to give off the impression of being nonpartisan
7401750 in the world of television satellite pay cable today the desire or need to appear nonpartisan is no longer necessary
7401751 you are from the very beginning indicating that you are partisan
7401752 our mission is to celebrate african american culture and chronicle african american achievement

7401755 fisheries probably provide more jobs but mining is year round jobs with higher incomes
7401756 even the tiniest hint that this fish isnt safe is detrimental to the price of my fish
7401757 if people think the fish could be contaminated they wont buy it the timing of this couldnt be worse just as we are trying to salvage our industry
7401758 my friends up there are scared about this winter especially with the gas prices up
7401759 most of the year they just shoot a moose and a bear and wait for the state oil dividends they need jobs everythings ailing
7401760 there was another time when another young candidate was running for president and challenging america to cross a new frontier
7401761 he faced public criticism from the preceding democratic president who was widely respected in the party
7401762 ted has been at the forefront of every single cause thats important to democrats for my entire adult life
7401763 having gotten to know him in the senate what i came to realize was hes probably the hardest working senator that we have and during this campaign what ive seen is the sheer joy he gets out of politics he cares so deeply about the people hes fighting for but he also just enjoys being the mix and the give and take
7401764 the man who just spoke is going to be president of the united states and he is going to change this country
7401765 the kennedy family has been with us from the very early days
7401766 every major civil rights battle senator kennedy has been there hes been a warrior hes been a fighter hes been a workhorse for civil rights
7401767 baracks whole message is i can stand in everyones shoes
7401768 is remarkably underdeveloped when it comes to talking about mixed racial experience the places in between for those people who are neither black nor white but both the opportunity with obama is maybe we can start to craft this language to break out of that calcified language america has held on to for all these years
7401769 this election is all about whether obama is in the mccain campaigns phrase ready to lead
7401770 if a majority think the answer is yes he wins if a majority think the answer is no mccain wins
7401771 people need to get a handle on him in the end this election is about him he needs to let people know as much about his values and priorities as he can in four days
7401772 the images of both men are by now indelibly imprinted on voters minds
7401773 rather than wasting time defining himself or his opponent senator obama should define his pathway for changing the direction of this country
7401774 obama needs to define himself but others must define mccain
7401775 as long as hillarys forces continue to be sore losers and obamas people are arrogant sore winners they will never fully heal
7401776 this will be one of the major positives from this convention
7401777 the hesitation on him as a speaker was that he didnt even hold federal office yet so how prominent could he be
7401778 he was unproven but we became convinced that he also offered incredible promise
7401779 ultimately we look forward to a debate between joe biden and barack obama about whether barack obama has the judgment and experience to lead
7401780 the choice on iraq in this election is clear and compelling
7401781 joe biden believes the war was a mistake john mccain would still do it all over again joe biden knows the bush mccain policy has weakened our hand fighting terrorism and finding osama bin laden john mccain started beating the drums for war after september 11th and wants to double down on the bush policy for four more years if barack obama and joe biden had set iraq policy these last six years rather than george bush and john mccain we wouldnt be in the hole were in today
7401782 the president always has the right to act preemptively if we are in imminent danger if they are coming up over the hill he can respond if troops are coming out of tijuana heading north we can respond if they are coming down from toronto we can respond if missiles are on their way we can respond but that is not the way i hear it being used here we are talking about preemption as if we are adopting a policy
7401783 the power of the purse is useless because it presents us with a hobsons choice
7401784 we have our fighting men and women in place and we are told by the way the president will not take them home so lets cut off the support for them so they have no guns no bullets no ability to fight a war and no one is willing to do that
7401785 may not be as good as other headliners the first three nights but hopefully it will make clear the choice the american people will face in november
7401786 the systems that generate elections and earthquakes are complex systems
7401787 they are not predictable by simple equations but after coarse graining averaging they become predictable
7401788 we didnt look at it as reagan versus carter or republicans versus democrats or liberals versus conservatives rather we looked at elections as stability versus upheavals
7401789 in the days leading up to the primary sleep was losing out
7401790 the campaign wasnt focused on virginia so we couldnt get literature from them
7401791 i couldnt live with myself if i didnt do everything i could to get obama elected
7401792 the last time virginians voted for a democrat for president was 1964 before the voting rights act of 1965 was passed i think its shameful thats what turned it and i think its a beautiful thing that an african american candidate is going to turn it back the american experience has engendered this really festering wound over race its the elephant in the room i dont think this is going to solve it but it will go a long way
7401793 everybody working on the campaigns for the parties for the state parties you can run into them talk to them learn from them get their cards and its quite useful
7401794 the very fact of the hype attracts so many moths to the flame and theres a ton of information you pick up that is valuable in the longer term
7401795 its pretty absurd that there are 15 000 media people going theres not enough news and information to feed all those journalists you have to be careful not to spend too much time trading conventional wisdom with other reporters
7401796 i figured steinbeck had his dog and kerouac had his drugs id have my typos
7401797 gods way is the best way gods way is the right way ill trust in him always he knows what is best
7401798 to look back on a life and particularly on a life lived well is a humbling and inspiring thing so it is with a great sense of honor privilege and deep gratitude that ive taken some time to think back on the life of paul upole or to me grandpa
7401799 the only thing that counts is faith working itself out in love
7401800 peggy listen to me get out of here and move forward this never happened it will shock you how much it never happened

7401803 i never expect him to be anything other than what he is
7401804 i guess when you try to forget something you have to forget everything
7401805 of course don knew about peggys time in the hospital
7401806 maybe a new stadium is in the future in niagara falls so its less a drive for the people from up here
7401807 i dont have mixed emotions my loyalty is with the bills in western new york
7401808 i think its important though to establish relationships with some major people up here because who knows what the future holds ive had discussions with mr ralph wilson team owner and he knows my agenda he talks about people up here with money but i tell him i know 15 or 20 people in the buffalo market with money too

7401812 even with the fluctuation of gold prices our volume as grown exponentially throughout 2008 our new location will help us keep up with the high growth due to word of mouth advertising great customer services and overall high customer satisfaction

7401814 john baptized you in water you will be baptized in the holy spirit the baptism of the holy spirit is what god does when he turns on the water of the spirit through the vine
7401815 dont ask yourself what the world needs ask yourself what makes you come alive and go do that because what the world needs is people who have come alive
7401816 ireaneus said many centuries ago the glory of god is a human being fully alive true jesus did say if anyone would come after me he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me luke 9 23 but when we apply this verse rigidly without qualification from the rest of scripture it leads to the very opposite of what god intends we are not to die to the good parts of who we are god plants desires in our hearts so we will nuture and water them when i ask people tell me about your wishes hopes and dreams they are often speechless
7401817 holy holy holy is the lord almighty the whole earth is full of his glory
7401818 consequently you are no longer foreigners and aliens but fellow citizens with gods people and members of gods household
7401819 your kingdom come on earth as it is in heaven
7401820 but now in christ jesus you who were far away have been brought near through the blood of christ
7401821 and in him you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which god lives by his spirit
7401822 his gods intent was that now though the church the manifold wisdom of god should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms according to his eternal purpose which he accomplished in christ jesus our lord
7401823 hey why did she get to look all around the room
7401824 unless you change and become like a little children you will never enter the kingdom of heaven
7401825 hey hun im home and i brought a homeless man with me to take a shower
7401826 ok lord if this light stays green ill run on home
7401827 im just running home would you like to come and take a shower
7401828 would you like to come to my home and shower
7401829 it is not the healthy who need a doctor but the sick
7401830 ive been advised by pistolas fc medical staff to not play for a month
7401831 which really means i hope to be back august 31st for the playoffs
7401832 i wouldnt have promotion and relegation thats what central entity is like the nfl in american football once you get central entity you basically share the wealth
7401833 if you want to become a multi multibillion pound empire you may have to look at changing the model
7401834 i talk to richard scudamore about this all the time are we maximising the central entity of the premier league
7401835 were getting into a situation where there are maybe ten clubs do saudi arabians want to buy and no disrespect to these clubs stoke city or derby county or do they want to buy newcastle united aston villa manchester united manchester city
7401836 let us sing a song to welcome our guest speaker today our beloved superintendent
7401837 we have lived by the assumption that what was good for us would be good for the world we have been wrong we must change our lives so that it will be possible to live by the contrary assumption that what is good for the world will be good for us and that requires that we make the effort to know the world and to learn what is good for it we must learn to cooperate in its processes and to yield to its limits but even more important we must learn to acknowledge that the creation is full of mystery we will never clearly understand it we must abandon arrogance and stand in awe we must recover the sense of the majesty of the creation and the ability to be worshipful in its presence for it is only on the condition of humility and reverence before the world that our species will be able to remain in it
7401838 shes got genetics on her side and shes a really talented kid
7401839 whether its because shes played for a while or what she certainly has a good feel for the game
7401840 for a tall player she is still able to do a lot of things in the back row that smaller players who have trained a lot take a long time to learn
7401841 she has really capitalized on getting the chance to play at her junior olympic club shes gotten lots of good coaching and it has helped her out a lot
7401842 she not only has the tall volleyball build but she has the instincts and the athletic prowess to capitalize on her size
7401843 she said go ahead and try it at the burnsville thunder volleyball club
7401844 i made it and after that played at northern lights when i came to lights i really started getting competitive with it
7401845 anybody who knows me knows thats probably more my mind set
7401846 when you have all those guys out there you force the defense to cover the entire field then we find those running holes now if youre a traditional power football team not everybody has the players to do that a team like michigan maybe can do that
7401847 i picked the spread because i think its a very dynamic offense
7401848 it will allow us to recruit great football players thats a huge part of the deal
7401849 he brought in a whole new concept to the big ten as to what we could do
7401850 joe came in and he started to open up offenses and created a lot of problems and we in coaching are all people that are mimics
7401851 right now in college football the spread is spreading all over the country
7401852 because its effective the big ten is no different you incorporate what works and what works now is a spread offense with a quarterback who can throw it and run it for a defense its impossible to account for a quarterback who can run or throw from a spread look
7401853 young people like to throw and catch and run around and high five each other and enjoy having fun playing the game if you want to keep them involved in the sport of football you have to provide an outlet that is enjoyable to them
7401854 i often refer to our society as being an instant gratification society so the offense just fits in
7401855 the thing i like about being at wisconsin right now is that were unique
7401856 five years ago when the spread first started coming into the league you needed preparation versus those teams now wisconsin is unique you line up with a fullback and tailback and have some big ugly guys in front that come downhill now people have to go into a certain preparation mode against wisconsin which to me is an advantage
7401857 if wisconsin goes out and wins it maybe well go back to power football
7401858 right now there is a real emphasis on the spread the spread is proving to be an outstanding offense at some point that will turn back again there are great minds on the defensive side of the ball they will make their adjustments get better at defending it
7401859 theyre a playoff team so we knew what to expect we came out the second half with a good drive and really got into a groove thats what our offense is all about when you play playoff caliber teams its going to be tough
7401860 you cant put it on one person on one i made a call late and somebody thought i did the snap count but i was just trying to move the protection just things like that through the preseason you still work on those things and hopefully you get all those kinks worked out
7401861 you cant go into the season and make that many mistakes its already hard enough to win a game so if you create penalties and set yourself back its even harder
7401862 you just have to let guys play so they can get a little bit of a feel as opposed to a series then pull them out and put somebody else in
7401863 would i have liked to see booty the whole second half yeah i would have
7401864 we had a holiday club with about 70 bulgarian children in a gypsy village the evening time was a service and following a time of worship the team shared their drama some gave their testimony and they sang a song for the 50 teens and adults that came
7401865 may our street become as famous as azusa someday as a spiritual place that draws persons to gods presence
7401866 this year the camps purpose has been expanded beyond the children that oaza cares for daily they have received a grant from the city funded by the european union to make it a cultural diversity experience for both the oaza kids and kids from nearby communities there will be children teens and adults who are ethnic romanians ethnic roma gypsy ethnic hungarian romanian speaking american and british
7401867 when i first suggested to my theatre class that we make
7401868 if it didnt then it wouldnt be in the bible gods very word now would it
7401869 eventually they caught the police officer and dragged him before the court in court as the judge considered the sentence of the police officer the woman spoke boldly he took my family away from me and i still have a lot of love to give and he needs to know what love and grace feel like so i think he should have to come to visit my home in the slums twice a month and spend time with me so that i can be a mother to him so i can embrace him and he can know that my forgiveness is real
7401870 on the promotion you have 365 days of no payments and no interest there is no pre payment penalty if you were to pay off the bike before the 365 days you would only owe the amount financed
7401871 ride a moto guzzi 50 miles and youll return it ride it 500 miles and youll never ride anything else
7401872 doug and i have remained friends for a long time and we were really good friends back in the east carolina days coaching for steve logan at the time
7401873 i think dougs a really good football coach i think hes very creative he uses his personnel wisely and puts them in the right position
7401874 theyre still running the same stuff the terminologys the same and im sure they call the same formations that we do because we were all in it when we first put that in with coach logan way back when in 1991
7401875 last year i felt about the same way i feel right now i wish i had a crystal ball to look forward
7401876 i thought it was a pretty good challenge between him and marty bowman but we created some depth there
7401877 the only thing i dont know yet is how davis is going to play in a game
7401878 queener didnt let a goal in until the very last minute and he was even plus minus you cant ask for anything better than that he had some exciting plays out of the goal
7401879 it actually woke me up and made me want to get out there again so that i didnt get knocked down
7401880 after that all the facets of our team started clicking and i just had to make a couple of saves and everything rolled from there
7401881 when we gave him some chances to get out there he just seemed to light up the team and light up the crowd
7401882 we started to feed him more and more playing time and the more he got the better he did it just kind of grew like a snowball
7401883 i got stymied behind the tree and i got lucky because i got a drop because of some gopher holes or whatever it was
7401884 it wasnt where my ball was but like about 5 or 6 feet left it was actually moving you could see the grass going up and down it was actually there and we were trying to find it but we couldnt
7401885 i just wanted to know why he got a drop there was obviously a mole there and he was burrowing at that moment you could see him popping out i was really focused on what i was doing
7401886 i was surprised to see it go in and he was even more surprised to see mine go in
7401887 its hard to see your friend not win especially if hes playing against you but somebody has to win
7401888 i really am happy with how i played and obviously disappointed i wasnt able to play a little bit better in the playoff
7401889 ive got to forget about that and think about the other 72 holes
7401890 i want to be a professional golfer but i want to be a student at college as well
7401891 a real smart racer explained it to me this way after he wrecked me and i was real mad
7401892 was a lot faster than me and went ahead and got to my back bumper and just smoked the back bumper of my car and sent me up the racetrack
7401893 he does that and hell always come back and say hes sorry
7401894 he did it at milwaukee and hes done it a few other times its just his normal fashion
7401895 well go on and well race him that way in the chase if thats the way he wants to race
7401896 but if barack might run well he would be the only guy to cause me to get in
7401897 when was the last time a black guy pulled this off well never a black guy in the senate only three years who had never done anything in their opinion they felt he was just a pretty boy they had a bloated campaign and no strategy
7401898 by the time they focused on him it was over he was credible he was real and they couldnt stop him
7401899 give me a mock up of the schedule for a week so i would know what it looks like
7401900 give me a schedule for a day how often will i see michelle and the kids
7401901 one day we did a rapid question and answer session with him so he would know what was coming
7401902 we asked him questions about his personal finances the votes he took in the senate things like that he was really good
7401903 we thought we had to be almost a perfect campaign to win
7401904 they will get the traditional support and where does that leave us
7401905 but we had a 60 year old woman who voted for the war thats a fact the online community is very liberal
7401906 people in our campaign were in shock that obama raised what he did
7401907 it belied our arrogance that nobody else could meet her on the field of battle
7401908 it was a sacrifice to work for bill clinton and go to little rock everybody wanted to be james carville and paul begala and george stephanopoulos and thats not who we were we were a d c based bloated campaign with people who were with her because she was the safest bet and we paid the most and hired the most and she was the most likely nominee and at headquarters we were all just worried about getting shivved in the shower
7401909 there was plenty of discussion in the spring of 2007 about her apologizing for her war vote
7401910 but she didnt want to apologize because she didnt think she had made a mistake and from a political standpoint apologizing would have been inconsistent with her strength and experience message
7401911 he thought it was crazy not to spend every day in south carolina
7401912 he thought he could make it close bill thought he could do well not just with black voters in south carolina but also with white voters
7401913 i love bill but he was 100 percent delusional it was a classic case of his overestimating his own strength
7401914 we hoped that the superdelegates would see that she was the better and more electable candidate
7401915 han s g mig djupt i gonen och kysste min hand

7401927 there were three canoes parked in the driveway which is startling
7401928 you couldnt have a conversation without running into someone who had such total devastation
7401929 within the first three days we had people from 11 different states in our household
7401930 the outpouring of strangers is the thing that really gets you
7401931 it means a lot to the village to have that bridge there
7401932 the main thing discovered or encountered is the need for all social service agencies to be prepared to go out into the community
7401933 the people are saying no im here and im going to stay here
7401934 the city was very lucky to have had chief traver at their service during the flood
7401935 both of those businesses were not living up to the owners expectations
7401936 and once the flood came they both decided this was as good a time as any to pull the plug
7401937 were rebounding back i think everybody has recovered remarkably well we have a close knit community
7401938 we cant find any issues with the care patients received and yet we have a national report that our heart failure mortality rate was worse than expected we take serious exception to that
7401939 this would be a lot more relevant if we found someone had needed heart medication and we didnt give it to them and they passed away
7401940 the rule of small numbers is really in play here
7401941 if we had one less death we wouldnt be sitting here having this conversation
7401942 its problematic when were looking at mortality rates if we arent going to break out those items that are out of a hospitals control
7401943 how many people heard about the checkpoint and decided not to drink and drive we stopped some people that had just been woke up and were on their way to pick someone up because they got a call and the person was worried about driving and getting stopped
7401944 all weve ever wanted to know is where annabelle is so we can bring her back and give her a proper burial
7401945 there are currently no new developments in the case but there seems to be a lot of information that was never acted upon
7401946 many times people have either forgotten about cases like this or they are not known about beyond the local community where they happen
7401947 were coming to mount cory to increase awareness and to let people know this case isnt going to go away
7401948 we have not had one second of problem as a coaching staff with our team
7401949 weve been joined at the hip for the last three years
7401950 i never expected to be kissed by coach k but that was a great moment
7401951 i want to thank coach k for believing in me and ive told him that
7401952 he was the one who believed in me coming back to this team
7401953 we dont run too many plays we just spread the floor break guys down and share the ball
7401954 we didnt have a great exhibition game last saturday at unc wilmington
7401955 so i think the girls were very very anxious to get out and kind of play better and take it to a different level than we did last saturday we did that but it comes down to finishing we did a great job of finishing
7401956 its his moves his ankles its his whole lower half its everything about him he just wiggles free
7401957 hes got long legs and a long arm span hes kind of built like a spider that helps him to change direction real well hes very shifty hes got real good flexibility
7401958 if he lost he was going to cry hed sit inside and cry
7401959 but winning hed just put that big smile on and thats it
7401960 he wasnt real muscular but he could certainly throw the football and take a hit
7401961 wed scrimmage a little bit and hed make a play and we were like dang
7401962 once we watch the film i get amazed sometimes at how i get away i dont know
7401963 it appears that a propane tank fell over and became disconnected in the area of a fry o later which was active and at that point there was an escape of propane gas which led to a fire and when individuals tried to intervene to correct the situation three people were injured

7402008 the chinese set up three parks for protests but the permitting process was so cumbersome no permits were issued that i am aware of
7402009 it has been very quiet with the occasional tibetan banner flag i have a vpn that allows me to see anything i want but i have not heard of any new more aggressive censorship its just the same old whack a mole approach theyve consistently employed
7402010 this is like a mouth with a tongue cut off it does not matter how wide the mouth is opened because you can only hear some unclear moaning sounds
7402011 yes it would be overkill to find an earthquake orphan to ignite the flame and it would also be against many political considerations
7402012 but why not have one minute of silence before declaring the opening of the olympics almost 100 000 lives were lost three months ago and they dont deserve a minute of silence does the introduction of the earthquake factor based upon humanitarian reasons ruin the celebrative mood is the exhibition of mourning during the olympics embarrassing to china
7402013 is it just a variety show that is westernised but produced better than the west can
7402014 the more i watched the more i felt that is shallow and overplayed this opening ceremony showed the strength of china but it did not show chinese culture over the next two weeks or so the chinese people will feel great that they have finally stood up but after the beijing olympics is over the problems of china will not disappear the rich poor gap will continue to exist the people will still be deprived of their rights the human rights problem will remain and corruption among government officials will continue to exist
7402015 does such an extravagant games necessarily demonstrate our countrys strength and prosperity
7402016 fearful at heart i think the so called century old dream isnt the peoples dream and the so called best olympics is nothing more than the most costly games
7402017 olympics is being given the most important political mission the largest image project to be achieved through national mobilisation at all costs
7402018 the economic loss and sacrifice of common peoples interests are nothing compare with such a goal if a chinese has some doubt then he she will be trashed as a dissident who runs tremendous political risk if a foreigner has questions then he she will be labeled as part of anti china conspiracy group ready to be grilled i myself am ever more distanced from the olympics consciously

7402032 i still have things that i want to do in the sport ive never competed over here in london and im looking forward to really experience more of the city and be able to prepare myself to hopefully swim some fast times
7402033 as a nation we now look forward to holding the olympic games in london in 2012
7402034 the golden triumphs of the present british team can only serve as further inspiration to those who will be working hard over the next four years to make the london games a shining example of olympic success
7402035 the handover was marked with a quirky eight minute cameo of the capital that smacked more of the swinging sixties than of the 21st century cosmopolis that will stage the next games
7402036 if this is a statement of intent from the 2012 organisers that they will not try to match beijing in scale or spectacle but will instead rely on flair and wit it is commendable
7402037 as an emerging superpower china felt it had something to prove london should in keeping with our nations character be a little more understated
7402038 a boy came with me after ten minutes another person came first he kept checking the electricity meter and then he went inside after 15 20 minutes there was an explosion inside
7402039 the watches wires and explosives recovered from the site point towards a plan of exploding a timer device
7402040 we are naturally disappointed but in a way the postponement is a victory for us under these circumstances there were only two solutions either to relocate the event to sri lanka or postpone it had it been relocated it would have deprived us of the hosting rights
7402041 people kept telling me that the door to victory lane would finally open and today we broke through it the door was really stuck but what an incredible effort by team penske i cant thank them enough im really excited about today because the car was extremely fast for me it was really fun pushing and pushing every lap for the entire race thats what its all about and thats what made us win we didnt save any fuel we just kept going and going and it paid off in the end
7402042 we didnt plan it like that but with the traffic we changed the plans lap by lap and we pitted when we thought we were going to slow down we never let our guard down we just kept pushing and we came away with a win
7402043 the attitude of those guys is priceless everyone has been working so hard since last wednesday taking cars to charlotte and bringing cars back from charlotte converting cars from oval to road course youre talking about two days work in 12 hours when you see guys doing that you just want to do your best not that we dont always give our best but you want to make it a special day and today it was
7402044 the fraternity pulled together with us and helped us get back together all these guys they are all racers a great group of guys it is all about people and helio castroneves and ryan briscoe really did the job today we have tough competition out there helio wanted to get that win and wow what a way to do it under the adversity we had this week i want to thank everyone that called us and helped us over the last several days
7402045 every time you sit in the pits you are closer to a heart attack than when you are in the car
7402046 in the beginning i didnt know if it would affect the car because we were under yellow
7402047 we felt a little understeer and on cold tires i had no grip it was really a shame everything did work out though
7402048 we made up about 30 seconds in the last part of the race
7402049 if thats what it takes to win then we do it its always really tough with the slower cars and traffic they are racing and we are racing i saw two or three gt cars racing while i was trying to catch the leader i cant waste time or tires and its not easy to find the right way we didnt touch anyone today so we did ok
7402050 i didnt know gil was leading when he ran out of fuel my main concern was getting past fernandez toward the end i think he was trying to save fuel as well it was fantastic racing we were passing backward and forward it was a joy to be a part of it
7402051 i think weve had the mindset to keep it going
7402052 everywhere we show up were pretty competitive we dont think there is a track where we dont think we have a chance of winning the porsches were getting some great fuel mileage and davids run really saved some fuel
7402053 it was a difficult race because the prototypes were so fast
7402054 they would pass us every six or seven laps it felt like the race to us wasnt about the ultimate lap time but being smart in traffic i was very happy with our guys who helped us know who was coming we didnt have a scratch on our car and were able to put some time on the second car
7402055 this was an amazing race the history of this place is magical and for us to compete here is a very cool deal to be a part of history
7402056 we had a really good weekend for both cars here one of your biggest concerns is traffic and how psychotic the p2 cars and p1 cars are but they were all pretty respectful and i think it showed
7402057 the car was really great and its the first weekend this year where weve had no problems at all
7402058 the car was as good as it could have been from the first lap it was easy driving in this car if we pushed the farnbacher loles car was a second a lap slower it was a matter of staying out of trouble passing is tough here because the only place to do it is on the backstretch
7402059 we showed that we are very competitive at every race but we couldnt finish on the top position we finally got it its something weve known wed be able to do all week the michelin tires were amazing and we could turn very good lap times it was a good race all day with many cars im really happy to be on the top of the podium
7402060 it isnt just a privacy issue it is a trespassing issue with their own photos as evidence
7402061 they really went off the track to get to our address
7402062 nothing you do ever goes away and nothing you do ever escapes notice
7402063 we saw a lot of road kill and thought of you
7402064 ya meskipun pdip sebagai partai opisisi dalam berbagai hal pasti kita melakukan kerja bersama sama dengan golkar
7402065 nanti dulu sekarang komunikasi masih berjalan terus menerus dan pembicaraan masih berlangsung
7402066 tidak mungkin bangsa ini nanti diurus oleh kelompok kelompok jadi ini merupakan silaturahmi kontinyu dan tidak hanya berhenti di sini saja
7402067 kita boleh berbeda warna tapi satu dalam menyatukan bangsa ini makin sering kita bertemu dan berdialog makin bagus
7402068 tidak mungkin berdialog mengenai bagaimana memenangkan partai masing masing di pemilu nanti tapi kursi yang kita peroleh kita satukan untuk memajukan bangsa ini
7402069 kekuatan yang dulu tersekat sekat kini ke arah yang lebih terbuka dan tidak ada sekat sekat lagi untuk menyatukan bangsa ini

7402072 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7402073 joe and i will appear for the first time as running mates this afternoon in springfield illinois the same place this campaign began more than 19 months ago
7402074 im excited about hitting the campaign trail with joe but the two of us cant do this alone
7402075 we need your help to keep building this movement for change
7402076 we can no longer allow ourselves the luxury of a public administration that doesnt work
7402077 these reforms affect the most vulnerable sectors of society because the rich can afford private services its the poor that need efficient state schools and hospitals i have clearly caught the popular mood 60 million italians are behind me
7402078 you will need all of it northbounders have it worse than i did

7402081 unless the united states nato and its central asian allies move quickly they could lose this war the following steps need to be taken in the coming weeks washington must finally make clear to pakistans leaders the mortal threat they face the army must turn its attention from india to the fight against the taliban civilian leaders must realize that there can be no separate peace with the extremists sending american troops or warplanes into pakistani territory will only feed anti american furies that should be the job of pakistans army with intelligence help and carefully monitored financial support from the united states
7402082 during the transition period if there is no supreme court if there is no legislative branch the only thing you have left is the executive branch
7402083 i think the china government has done a very good job of
7402084 there must now be talks that will resolve this once and for all we cannot continue with the situation where hostilities are likely we must bring them to an end by having a permanent solution to this problem
7402085 it is the best thing you will ever do in your life im sure he is such a proud papa
7402086 i believe we need to learn from past experience any attempt to try and bridge gaps that maybe its premature to bridge because of the international pressure can lead to clashes this can lead to misunderstandings and to violence
7402087 high energy prices and increasing tax and premium payments mean the public will face a tough time
7402088 you cannot live a perfect day without doing something for someone who will never be able to repay you

7402100 even though during the week we are going to have international content the idea is to grow our local content
7402101 we have fleshed out aspects that will appeal to the indian community i think through our programmes we will establish who the south african indian is by linking durban to cape town to johannesburg
7402102 the cooking show is very light hearted where i get to know my guests while preparing dishes we also throw in a bit of karaoke
7402103 were not just about the glitz and glamour we will also talk about the reality of being an indian in south africa
7402104 its a wonderful fusion of culture gossip real issues and trendy titbits we could all use
7402105 and i heard as it were the noise of thunder
7402106 acabamos de recibir la noticia del embarazo y estamos muy emocionados
7402107 we have first hand experience of the skills problem here
7402108 the biggest problem you have is that so many people who have left over the past 15 years dont see a reason to come back unless you have globally competitive professionals working in sa you really cant support the local development needs
7402109 they prefer to find people who have experience and pick them up at inflated salaries from elsewhere rather than invest in new people
7402110 that practical work experience enables them to perform immediately when they get into the work environment
7402111 students typically work for three hours a day on some courses

7402120 the waspa code of conduct requires that after three failed attempts i e three months to bill for a content subscription the content subscription should be cancelled
7402121 although the regulation of content lies within the domain of waspa vodacom can take action against any wasp who uses its network should any misuse of the network be reported to us
7402122 one only has to look at the high volume of failed transactions to realize that this waspa code of conduct and threat of action against it is not an effective deterrent last time i saw these graphs the ratio of failed vs successful was about 4 to 1
7402123 they can only operate if they supply the mnos with their waspa membership number
7402124 while waspa cannot implement any technical protection we make recommendation to the networks and enforce all manner of pro active consumer protection through our code of good conduct
7402125 in addition we employ a monitor who proactively tests services scans the media and follows up on issues raised this culminates in complaints lodged through our very robust and quasi legal complaints system
7402126 a wasp who continues to bill a customer for content after a period of 3 months of unsuccessful billing could only do so in contravention of the waspa code of conduct

7402138 we have a collective database of 500 000 australians who have subscribed to one of empowereds five value generating online portals and an advertising base of over 360 brands and agencies that have been targeting these subscribers since 2004 according to comtel these are mainly aged between 18 and 40 and are rewarded for receiving mobile and online advertisements that match their registered demographic profile and lifestyle preferences

7402140 it was really a mess and people didnt know what to do
7402141 even two years ago it was a struggle to get a property we could afford both in dayton and the county now the housing slump has helped us because property is more affordable
7402142 we have 12 very specific job safety procedures dealing with all the tire work we do
7402143 the early signs appear that all the procedures were being followed
7402144 he was a great employee and good family man he coached his girls basketball team and was very well liked by those he worked with at the company and in the mill
7402145 they did it more after the fact thats what i dont like i felt they should have asked the neighborhood
7402146 it will boost the value of the neighborhood property values
7402147 id rather see a community center than build any more homes on weaver
7402148 this is a project to give back to the community and rebuild dayton
7402149 anytime you have quality housing with good people in the home it will impact positively on a neighborhood
7402150 we are forecasting a numbing winter with below average temperatures for at least two thirds of the country
7402151 only the far west and southeast will see near normal temperatures
7402152 between now and october how the weather evolves could give some clues
7402153 at first we got a little bit overexcited but now we realize weve got to sit back and do this in a timely manner and do things right
7402154 i think theres a lot of commitment on the part of the fair board to make something happen
7402155 if you were for hillary you have to be for barack
7402156 obama has to hope that biden can connect with hillary inclined white union members
7402157 biden speaks their language he is also surprisingly little known but obama cannot afford to lose 20 or 30 percent of the hillary vote it is going to take a lot of work by the democrats at the convention and beyond to unify the party base
7402158 we connect those things to this candidate and i think our folks see that obama is right for the change
7402159 working families in ohio continue to share joe bidens belief that barack obama lacks the experience and judgment to lead our nation thats why john mccain will continue to engage ohioans of every political party and background on his plans to create jobs and get our economy moving again

7402194 a long term threat and a short term threat to our national security
7402195 for sen bidens iraq hearings to be anything more than a political sham used to invoke a modern day gulf of tonkin resolution equivalent for iraq his committee will need to ask hard questions and demand hard facts concerning the real nature of the weapons threat posed by iraq
7402196 everyone in the world thought he had them the weapons inspectors said he had them
7402197 preordained a conclusion that seeks to remove saddam hussein from power regardless of the facts and using these hearings to provide political cover for a massive military attack on iraq
7402198 as long as saddams at the helm there is no reasonable prospect you or any other inspector is ever going to be able to guarantee that we have rooted out root and branch the entirety of saddams program relative to weapons of mass destruction
7402199 the only way were going to get rid of saddam hussein is were going to end up having to start it alone
7402200 its going to require guys like you in uniform to be back on foot in the desert taking saddam down
7402201 one thing is clear these weapons must be dislodged from saddam or saddam must be dislodged from power
7402202 if we wait for the danger from saddam to become clear it could be too late
7402203 he did not snub the u n or our allies he did not dismiss a new inspection regime he did not ignore the congress at each pivotal moment he has chosen a course of moderation and deliberation
7402204 i do not believe this is a rush to war i believe it is a march to peace and security i believe that failure to overwhelmingly support this resolution is likely to enhance the prospects that war will occur
7402205 we must be clear with the american people that we are committing to iraq for the long haul not just the day after but the decade after

7402224 the democrats last two vice presidential picks joe lieberman and john edwards have not to put it gently aged well politically but barack obamas selection of joe biden may prove that the third time in this decade is the charm
7402225 should not have a major impact on control of the u s senate
7402226 biden who is up for re election this year faces nominal competition from television pundit christine o donnell a spokeswoman for delawares board of elections said this week that biden can run concurrently for both the senate and vice president just like joe lieberman did in 2000
7402227 will lose control of bidens seat in the senate if he and barack obama take the white house
7402228 obama has held a two point lead in all three of ppps virginia polls hes not having as much of a problem here as he is in some other states with nailing down the democratic vote an 84 12 lead with voters in his own party is not too dissimilar from john mccains 89 7 independents are basically split with obama leading 41 39

7402230 democratic leaders plan to use barack obama s acceptance speech thursday evening as the spearhead of a high tech effort to reach out simultaneously to millions of voters
7402231 the planned effort which will include asking all 75 000 or so people in the audience to text message or cell phone friends across the country represents the latest twist in the obama campaigns unprecedented use of communications technology
7402232 colorado is one of the most important battleground states that will decide the presidency as sen john mccain and sen barack obama slug it out nose to nose if the national election is close in november a handful of votes in colorado will be decisive right now independent voters are split with 46 percent for sen mccain and 44 percent for sen obama
7402233 the results show little movement from the last post abc survey conducted in mid july before obama embarked on a highly publicized trip overseas and prior to a series of fierce exchanges between the campaigns other recent national polls also show only limited changes in the overall race heading into the conventions although several of those surveys indicate an even tighter race

7402255 he says she then leaned down and unzipped his trousers and performed oral sex on him
7402256 kalau orang cina ditolak tolaknya nasi ni dengan chopstick ke dalam mulut
7402257 tapi orang jepun jarang mengangkat mangkuk ustaz cuma kalau orang jepun makannya kena berbunyi bunyi sikit chup chup
7402258 biar nampak berselera ya ustaz dah baca tentang hal itu dalam buku ini
7402259 tapi anta kena ingat ada isteri di malaysia yang memohon fasakh di mahkamah dengan alasan tidak tahan dengan kerenah suami yang makan berbunyi bunyi annoying
7402260 ustaz rehat rehatlah dulu pukul 2 30 nanti ada taklimat dari pihak resort
7402261 memang ustaz banyak betul pantang larangnya kalau kita terima business card sesiapa misalnya jangan terus masuk dalam poket itu tanda kita memperkecilkannya so bila dapat kad tu kita letak kat atas meja baca namanya tengok orangnya tanda kita bersungguh berkenalan dengannya
7402262 sebenarnya kalau di pejabat pun sama ustaz kita kena fikir selangkah ke depan kalau dah selesai kerja hari ini kena siapkan bahan bahan untuk mulakan kerja esok kalau kerja cleaner di hotel tisu tisu dan bahan yang sudah diagihkan ke bilik kena dilengkapkan semula stoknya supaya mudah untuk kerja esok
7402263 maknanya kita tidak perlu hafal etika orang jepun ini kalau kita tahu cara berfikir mereka maka secara semulajadi sahaja kita akan buat perkara perkara tersebut betul tak
7402264 kemudian apabila engkau telah selesai dari satu satu pekerjaan maka bersungguh sungguhlah engkau berusaha meneruskan pekerjaan yang berikutnya
7402265 dan kepada tuhanmu jua harus engkau datang memohon dengan penuh keinginan
7402266 this places considerable doubt on the version of mr bird
7402267 the accused person is actively trying to deceive police by inferring other people are involved in the matter and not being entirely truthful
7402268 the one point that i do agree with the learned sergeant is that facts before your honour are circumstantial
7402269 there are significant factual disputes in relation to the matter
7402270 if there is any breach of the bail conditions mr bird can be arrested for that i note that this can be a long procedure and with any breach of bail he would spend a long time in custody

7402275 faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen
7402276 what is faith but believing what you do not see
7402277 i have faith that it has thundered in the past and will again in the future
7402278 make yourself believe that there is a god no matter what the evidence on the question may be
7402279 a good ruler doesnt need to be a prophet not even god like a good rule has to be sensitive to the ones he rules
7402280 if helper classes worked well as a solution then extension methods will work better
7402281 we always feed a few imaginary pets right under babys high chair tray too
7402282 preschool and elementary age children 3 11 and their families are infested with head lice most often girls get head lice more often than boys and personal hygiene or cleanliness in the home or school has nothing to do with getting head lice

7402285 saya dan rakan yang bertanggunjawab menjaga aktiviti di bilik gerakan ini tidak dibenarkan menghadiri ceramah walaupun ceramah itu membabitkan pemimpin kami
7402286 itulah garis panduan yang perlu dipatuhi malah akan diminta pulang ke bilik gerakan jika terserempak di tapak ceramah
7402287 saya dan beberapa anggota parti dari negeri sembilan bergabung dengan ahli tempatan di negeri ini bagi memastikan setiap perancangan dapat berjalan dengan berkesan
7402288 bagaimanapun pergerakan akan lebih aktif pada sebelah petang apabila petugas selesai menjalankan tugas masing masing di syarikat majikan
7402289 seperti rakan lain kami mahu boleh menjadi kumpulan pendesak jika ada antara pemimpin yang tidak jujur bagi memastikan parti terus relevan
7402290 why do so many objectivists insist on attacking the honesty integrity and character of

7402293 det er en forferdelig sak men jeg er glad for at familien er samlet bak klagen og h per vi f r en avklaring snart
7402294 they keep putting fingers in the dike when are they going to get to the core operations of the sea and the convention center
7402295 i hate to be so blunt i fear unfortunately that if they go back there and get money its going to come at the expense of a lot of cultural and educational groups that are delineated in rad funding
7402296 because it wasnt part of the original list for funding i dont know that its fair to say that its not a regional asset i think it clearly meets the definition of a regional asset which makes it eligible for funding
7402297 it was not ever assumed that the convention center would be one of the regional assets
7402298 our objective is to maximize the usage of the building and minimize the deficit
7402299 i think we can safely assume there will be no significant growth in revenue if you look at the projections through the early parts of 2009 theyre generally pessimistic about economic activity
7402300 this place come hell or high water they get you out of bed
7402301 i dont know whats going on behind the scenes but i know people treat me with decency and respect i never had anyone abuse me
7402302 were thankful that their problems have not affected all of the residents but its a dangerous and fatal situation to be in waiting and wondering which resident could potentially be next
7402303 we have to act the way we do to ensure another family member doesnt have to endure the grief or trauma other families have been through
7402304 its almost like theyre picking you to shreds for no reason
7402305 to me its an insult to get a provisional license it used to be they were just for bad homes now i dont know
7402306 if theres a way for us to work with the facility to fix whatever problem so we dont have to remove people then we will do that
7402307 but if its a systemic problem we have to get residents out
7402308 we met with our residents to see if they had anything as other abuse to report
7402309 we sent letters to every family asking about awareness of issues and said if they had future suspicions we need to know there was not one call that came in
7402310 i think theyre on a witch hunt to close them down because of past activities
7402311 i only know them as reputable people who want to serve these elderly adults
7402312 the difference you see here is its family run so you see more love and caring going into it
7402313 with 90 percent of these employees there is no better but wherever you go youre going to get a couple of misfits
7402314 we cant continue to allow people to live in a facility where it appears as if we are just waiting for the next incident to take place
7402315 among others arrested locally and facing 36 months behind bars are a california prison guard
7402316 as though the incident was his fault it is thanks to the passion dedication and professionalism that these guys show on a daily basis for ferrari that the team is so special
7402317 it was definitely not the weekend i was hoping for
7402318 i do not believe that despite this negative result i am now out of the running for the title there are still six races to go and 60 points up for grabs we have seen that the situation change really quickly even if i realize things are now more complicated i made a mistake and left before i should have done fortunately pietro is not too badly hurt i wish him all the best and hope he gets better soon
7402319 i just backed off i expected him to back off because i was the leader but in the end i backed off otherwise one of us crashes into the wall i dont see any problem i let him go and passed him afterwards that was it
7402320 i was on top when we had the problem in hungary
7402321 it is so frustrating when the victory in your hand suddenly disappears with three laps left and the race is almost finished we came here and i was on the top again so the mentality was the same and we were even more motivated after the problem we came here to a new track and did a fantastic job choosing the right tyres was pretty difficult especially in qualifying but we did a perfect job on that and in making pole position and winning the race and taking the fastest lap there was nothing more we can ask for
7402322 the weekend started badly for me but it has finished really well today so im happy i pushed very hard when i needed to while paying attention to taking care of my tyres and my brakes throughout this shows how good we are getting and how nice it is to race with a competitive car every weekend toyota is doing a very good job this year and looking strong and more competitive at every circuit
7402323 it was fun but tough and hot out there its a nice race track we made no mistakes no mistakes all weekend and maximised our performance the whole team can be very proud of what it has achieved and hopefully for the next races we can be in the top 10 again
7402324 to finish ninth in a car which is obviously good enough for third is a disaster
7402325 i had big problems with the harder tyres during the first two stints and it was only better at the end with the softer compound i lost one position after the start and later in the race i couldnt gain any
7402326 i had to do 17 laps like that losing around 20 seconds to the group i was in the next two stints were good and i had a good pace
7402327 my mechanics did everything to try and allow me to continue
7402328 but my race was already compromised i am extremely disappointed
7402329 we made things difficult for ourselves by qualifying so far back on the grid
7402330 i was heavily fuelled compared to most others and running long on a one stop strategy but i was stuck behind heidfeld when he had already pitted which cost me some time as i didnt have the pace to overtake him
7402331 we are not going to parade nuns in bathing suits
7402332 but being ugly is not a requirement for becoming a nun external beauty is a gift from god and we mustnt hide it
7402333 its an initiative that belittles the role of nuns who have dedicated themselves to god
7402334 aku suka dia karena orangnya cuek aku juga jadi cocok

7402361 at least i didnt give em that idea god bless me for that
7402362 between 1960 and 1962 the combination of economic interest and national pride during the space race period inspired scientists of the soviet union to plan drilling a
7402363 sanitary facilities and shower rooms a first aid station a canteen to cater for staff day and night a meeting hall and rooms for preventative medical aid provide normal living conditions for the operating personnel of the rig
7402364 the complex scientific technological experiment of the kola superdeep drilling was accomplished solely by soviet technology and technique
7402365 earth science have sic a telescope deep drilling and deep geophysical probing
7402366 are we dedicated enough to use this telescope to go beyond our present limitations to reach for new frontiers of the earth sciences
7402367 is designed for low rpm drilling in hard rock interbedded with extremely hard rocks
7402368 you have to acknowledge the fact that it may have been the sense of discovery the idea that they might discover something that drove them
7402369 once i started getting one girl i had to get em all
7402370 i want to have arms that look like comic book pages with the girls bursting out
7402371 i wanted something big and bold that just said this is who i am

7402376 led by trombonist chris washburne the syotos band is an innovative mambo ensemble that incorporates latin jazz and dance music into its bold sound
7402377 i had been thinking about this project for a long time
7402378 as a camera fanatic and a product builder this was something i seemed destined to do
7402379 i have a bolex aaton arriflex eyemo filmo mitchell photosonic beaulieu keystone just about every movie camera you can think of
7402380 i told frederic that i couldnt even view my footage on a mac and that this had pissed me off enough that i wanted to build my own camera
7402381 we needed a bunch of guys who were inventors to come up with entirely new ways of getting to the finish line
7402382 but i heard about red because they were canvassing filmmakers and cinematographers asking if you could wave a magic wand what camera would you design
7402383 what separates us from other camera companies is that the vision guy is the decisionmaker
7402384 that was one of my biggest advantages at oakley and its the same at in the trenches in the product development and i make the final call red is a benevolent dictatorship
7402385 in hd whats right in front of the lens and whats 20 feet away are both sharp so the image looks flat
7402386 if it didnt work wed be cooked when it did it was like giving birth and counting all the fingers and toes to make sure everything was there it was phenomenal everybody went nuts
7402387 everyone started screaming like little kids first light first light its alive the thing actually worked
7402388 they were standing around scratching their heads that moment made a lot of people into believers
7402389 the red camera is the closest thing to film ive seen
7402390 jim why dont you fly down here to new zealand and ill shoot the footage for you
7402391 he was going to shoot a mini movie to put the cameras through their paces using them on helicopters and steadicams crawling on the ground with them and im thinking oh my gosh i just hope they keep working through the weekend
7402392 we stayed at peters house and he was just beaming because he was having so much fun
7402393 jim im all in i have to shoot with this
7402394 im making two movies with benicio del toro come to my house and well do a test if it looks as good as what i saw in peters film i want these cameras for my movies
7402395 it felt like someone crawled inside my head when they designed the red
7402396 a lot of cameras with electronics in them if you fired a 50 caliber automatic weapon a few inches away which we get microphonics all over the place
7402397 we beat the shit out of the reds on the che films and they never skipped a beat
7402398 you can buy this camera you can own it thats why people are excited
7402399 you put film in a can and stick it on a shelf and it costs 1 000 a year to store
7402400 with a project that starts as data you have it on a hard drive which has to be nursed and upgraded its an electronic mechanical device that cant be left unplugged
7402401 in the slammin jammin world of production you want a really tough machine that takes very simple approaches to problems
7402402 im not sure red is the way to go its a supercomputer with a lens on it
7402403 honestly if you proposed the film work flow today youd be taken to the city square and hung imagine i told you were going to shoot on superexpensive cameras using rolls of celluloid made in china that are a one time use product susceptible to scratches and that cant be exposed to light and you cant even be sure you got the image until theyre developed and you have to dip them in a special fluid that can ruin them if its mixed wrong people would think i was crazy
7402404 theres talent on the streets kids with ideas who have stories to tell and never get a chance
7402405 up to now theyve been limited to tools that confine their stories to youtube
7402406 i will say that the future of motion capture will be digital
7402407 and i think you can extend that to say the future of presentation will be digital
7402408 im not going to say im never going to do drugs again i just know im not a good person on drugs
7402409 it was the hardest thing for me when i realised i was pregnant and realised i wanted to have the baby i made a huge decision to make my life more stable
7402410 i did drink that night then i woke up in my bed at 8 am and felt totally fine so i googled myself and i saw the pictures
7402411 britneys dad is furious he thinks its a big mistake and doesnt want anything to do with it but britney thinks it will help her custody battle for her sons
7402412 this could be the biggest car crash television moment of all time
7402413 if you lose your good driver discount you will have to pay your entire insurance bill each month

7402434 go where the facts and evidence take you and do whats right
7402435 because of that im holding off giving or pledging until i know more about dukes actions and inactions in response to crystal mangums lies da nifongs and others attempts to frame three obviously innocent duke students and the frame up cheer leading that came loud and venomous from many at duke including faculty
7402436 mind you im not saying i wont give im saying ill hold off giving until bot chair steel and president brodhead give me and other alums more information
7402437 since march 2006 weve all gotten dozens of letters e mails copies of duke magazine and what not weve been to alumni weekend ive talked to people who were at those dinners with dick or whatever they were called
7402438 but weve gotten no explanation for why brodhead never said in march 06 the lacrosse captains had cooperated fully with police there must have been a reason for his withholding that information we want to know what it was
7402439 a lot of us wonder why brodhead or steel or someone at duke didnt speak out against those vicious activists who waved castrate and give them equal measure
7402440 please dont get me wrong i love duke and as i say i want to contribute
7402441 i will as soon as i get satisfactory answers to the questions im asking
7402442 i dont expect you to provide them steel and brodhead need to do that
7402443 i know nothing im asking about is your fault youve been very nice to talk to and i appreciate your listening
7402444 somebody at duke needs to tell us something besides we made an out of court settlement on that suit and the others so we cant say anything
7402445 its time duke told us the truth of what happened and what didnt happen
7402446 were not children we can handle the truth we deserve the truth

7402454 i know you might think that persecution is a sign that god has abandoned you but its the opposite god has deemed you worthy to suffer for the name of christ its his righteous judgment
7402455 it is a righteous thing for god to judge sin and condemn sinners
7402456 i cannot believe that a loving god would judge sinners and send people to hell

7402463 on the other hand the names that the accused are revealing may not ring a bell for the police it is quite possible that the person may be the same but the police and the accused know him by different names they have given themselves fake names for different purposes and are known by various aliases so it is possible that police is looking for the same person that the accused are mentioning but are finding it difficult to arrive at his real identity if photos are not available
7402464 we are exploring if those persons in custody of ahmedabad police are involved in the hyderabad blasts too or they know of the persons who were involved so far the names or links are not falling into place
7402465 the dozen odd persons arrested by the ahmedabad police also had given themselves aliases and throughout the operation they were known by that name only those who were involved in the operation did not know the real names of each other even during the training camps held in kerala and gujarat where persons from various states attended they had fake names in cases where we dont have the suspects sketch or photograph it is difficult to pin point who is who

7402502 the question for me is not so much whether st marys should be closed down but whether st marys will close itself down by practices that separate it from communion with the roman catholic church
7402503 nevertheless only extreme recklessness would place a buddhist statue in a christian church
7402504 no matter where that takes place there is every possibility it would arouse angry feelings particularly with christians from different religious cultures
7402505 but its own style of worship and sacramental practice can hardly be described as roman catholic
7402506 as such it is out of communion with the roman catholic archdiocese of brisbane and universal roman catholic church under the leadership of the bishop of rome

7402552 the ultimate lap time wasnt that important but getting through traffic without losing time was crucial
7402553 when jan and i were teamed together in 1999 i was really looking forward to having another year to build on what wed learned
7402554 that didnt happen but to build on what we learned about each other last year at corvette racing and then to carry that spirit into this year is very cool
7402555 my stint started out really good and we were able to attack hard at the start
7402556 i might have pushed the rear tires a little too hard and the car went loose so mentally and physically it was a lot of work we had a bit of a gap over the no 4 corvette then the caution closed it up the crew for the no 3 corvette did an incredible job to keep us out in front on the pit stops
7402557 i love watching this team operate in the pits and the first pit stop was a consummate demonstration of how well prepared the corvette racing crews are
7402558 both cars came in at the same time and left at the same time it was awesome
7402559 when you look at todays result it was a contest that either car could have won
7402560 at any given time in the race one car might have been a few tenths of a second faster than the other and thats great racing i think the fans enjoyed it and i know the team did too now were ready to head to detroit for our hometown event
7402561 i am happy for the team and both cars are okay
7402562 we were fast again the car is one piece so lets move on to detroit at the end of the day a 1 2 finish for corvette racing is good for everyone
7402563 traffic seemed to be horrendous at times and i kept losing out to jan in that
7402564 we seemed to have the quicker car and i could stick with him or gain a little when i got a clear track

7402571 the water had no where to go it went into the rivers and now its going to take a lot of time for that water to run through the system
7402572 im pleased about the declaration and grateful to president bush
7402573 those calls have been coming in and at this point we have some teams coming in that will be doing a more detailed assessment where they will be going into these homes and looking at what type of damage theyve had
7402574 he has this air of perfection and joe biden is more down to earth
7402575 its a total diss to sen clinton in my opinion
7402576 it just speaks volumes about how barack obama doesnt stand for anything
7402577 most people feel that if she wanted to press to be vice president she would have made a bigger push for it
7402578 madonna considering shes now 50 is so fit she did a really good job
7402579 he will have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7402580 the american dream under eight years of bush and mccain that american dream is slipping away
7402581 no one has supported president bush in iraq more than i have
7402582 support tax breaks for companies who ship our jobs overseas
7402583 you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7402584 ive been disappointed in my friend john mccain who gave in to the right wing of his party and yielded to the very swift boat politics that he once so deplored
7402585 folks campaigns for presidents are a test of character and leadership
7402586 thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience he will have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7402587 of course senator biden is comfortable on the attack he spent the entire primary highlighting barack obamas inexperience and failed judgment on national security
7402588 the nice thing about hosting one of these conventions is that you can show off
7402589 we dont want some traffic jam protest or unfortunate incident to become the big story because theres too much good stuff going on here we have the infrastructure to be prepared to handle anything
7402590 weve always had to overcome this idea that were not big enough or important enough to even be part of the national political landscape
7402591 that was part of the idea behind wanting to get the convention in the first place if people see colorado and the western spirit theyll get past all of that
7402592 there are some security measures in place that will be seen and some that will be unseen
7402593 we have a subcommittee to address any possible thing that can happen
7402594 i can tell youre my type of woman because you refused the straw
7402595 there are no jokes in islam there is no humour in islam there is no fun in islam
7402596 the plan is for him to fly in sunday night
7402597 if hes up to it in the 11th hour and can get the green light from doctors he might be able to pull it off
7402598 i hope obama loses so hillary can run in 12
7402599 10 000 people died in a tornado in kansas 12 died
7402600 mccain can some one please tell me my damn code name for that bloody football that follows me around all the time
7402601 10 000 people died in a tornado in kansas 12 died
7402602 ladies and gentleman the coverage of barack obama was embarrassing
7402603 i feel a tingling sensation going up my leg when i hear obama speak
7402604 shape up and get in line the republicans are coming
7402605 he probably should have bit his tongue but lets be honest rendell is not lying here msnbcs effusive love of obama was way over the top if thats how you feel thats fine but the one sided nature of msnbc during the primary was disgraceful
7402606 hailobamamessiah musical theme and use it for your convention theme it is a hoot just great
7402607 does it ever occur to ed rendell and the other hillary fanatics that the media may have tilted toward obama because hillary ran like a republican attack dog
7402608 its not surprising then that they get bitter they cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who arent like them or anti immigrant sentiment or anti trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations
7402609 gee ed you cant tell the obvious truth about msnbc news being in the bag for obama that might help mccain win
7402610 my candidate didnt use dirty tactics only hillary did this
7402611 by the way when tim russert of msnbc died the nation cried when snow of fox died few paid attention
7402612 people of pennsylvania arent ready to vote for a black candidate yet
7402613 people of pennsylvania arent ready to vote for a black candidate yet
7402614 rendells ego is bigger than his stomach hed never admit that he became a liability
7402615 fox is the mccain network with sean hannity as his biggest cheerleader
7402616 pat buchanon hates obama and cant even try to hide it he has venom in his voice anytime he speaks about him
7402617 he could have sold himself to wall street but he did not instead he worked as an organizer making only 10k
7402618 mccain will reinstate the draft and send your sons and daughters to war
7402619 bush mccain iraq war policies will or have already jeopardize our national security without we have no leverage and can not afford to go to war
7402620 fox new has been the voice of the republicans since its inception lets talk about that oreilly and hannity are the main culprits
7402621 whaaa whhhaaaa my candidate lost someone get the crybaby a diaper before he messes himself
7402622 shape up and get in line the republicans are coming
7402623 is obama qualified to lead the most powerful nation on earth
7402624 bama campaign keith olbermann you dont have to wear that blue drss dress tonight walk the streets for
7402625 bama since i knew him i wouldnt talk bad about the chosen one i have to tell you just how i feel i wont share you with another boy i know my mind is made up so put away your make up told you once i wont tell you again its a bad man love way keith olbermann you dont have to put on the red light roxanne you dont have to put on the red light i know who im voting for
7402626 anybody who is against the iraq war is un american
7402627 msnbc is totally in the tank for obama and all our guests reflect this view
7402628 as a democrat you ought to support the one chosen by the majority
7402629 cnn was squarely behind clinton so why are people complaining about msnbc keith was the only one behind obama joe s tucker and dan abahms were tough on obama so lets all stop whining
7402630 hes got the passion to lift up middle class americans he hasnt forgotten his working class roots he has the expertise that will make him a great counselor on international crises that might come up
7402631 has challenged the status quo and hes even criticized senator obama so its a tribute to senator obama that hes not just choosing a yes man but a person who will speak what he believes
7402632 im still tooling around with my speech a little bit it may not be as good as the other headliners the first three nights but hopefully it will make clear the choices the american people are going to face in november
7402633 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7402634 support of barack obama is clear she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7402635 a good team personality wise they complement each other well i think youre going to see them really enjoying being out on the trail together
7402636 now you pick someone who is a consummate washington insider who was elected to the u s senate when barack obama and i were 12 years old
7402637 the convention will give us an opportunity to reach out to those people hillary is going to be 100 percent for him
7402638 when he had darker hair it was pretty obvious he had larger plugs
7402639 with the lightening of his hair it looks much much better now
7402640 and a typical session is 1 000 to 2 000 grafts
7402641 a lot of people have touch up work and he may have had some
7402642 i think he should darken the hair on the top of his head
7402643 one of the reasons being with it being lighter than the rest of the hair it makes it appear to be thinner
7402644 in my view his haircut and style do not complement his squarish face shape
7402645 a forward comb with a serrated fringe would soften that
7402646 i mean its really common for a lot of guys
7402647 transplant hair if a good one can be cut and styled almost exactly like your real hair
7402648 senator obama sees community health centers as a vital part of efforts to invest in prevention and reduce costs
7402649 ive heard complaints from a handful of constituents but ive also had calls from people in the health care profession complaining
7402650 the medical professionals who have come to me are accusing the university of dumping patients on its neighboring institutions whether its being implemented in the way thats in the best interest of the patient i cant tell you
7402651 was running a campaign to cut coverage for the poor
7402652 in the past we opened our doors and saw whoever came
7402653 we would see a patient who had general pneumonia and if we needed to see a patient who needed a liver transplant that liver transplant patient couldnt get in the door
7402654 we were taking general patients away from mercy hospital michael reese and they were financially at risk
7402655 we harmed other hospitals without knowing we harmed other hospitals
7402656 the collapse of the health care system was driving more and more people to the emergency room
7402657 the trend line was and is a disastrous one from the standpoint of maintaining the hospital their goal was to find an answer

7402706 there was a lot of institutional selling in sterling mr waterer said
7402707 on the back of that we saw some other currencies fall such as the euro and the australian dollar

7402709 a stronger us dollar weaker gold theme has seen the aussie dollar retrace below the 0 8650 level mr waterer said

7402981 in view of these facts and in order to satisfy these important tribes and to prevent the difficulties which might hereafter arise through the settlement of whites who are already flocking into fort mcleod and other portions of this territory your excellency decided that these indians should be treated with this year and the indians were notified accordingly
7402982 his honor mr laird the lieutenant governor of the north west territories and lieut col james f mcleod c m g were selected by your excellency to negotiate the treaty the former of these gentlemen had assisted in 1874 in negotiating treaty number four with the cree and saulteaux indians and the latter during his residence for some years past at fort mcleod as commandant of the mounted police force had acquired the entire confidence and good will of the indian tribes proposed to be dealt with

7402984 he was great before he got hurt and i mean for brian he had a couple of good appearances and then he had a rough one
7402985 but for the most part hes been pretty consistent hes healthy when you first come back maybe sometimes you try to do too much to try to prove you are healthy and ready to go but hes really been pretty consistent since hes come back hes pretty much picked up from where he left off before he got hurt
7402986 we knew that we had a chance to sweep and any time you can do that youve got to take advantage of it especially where we are right now
7402987 we just kept swinging the bats kept swinging the bats and got a big homer by robbie cano late this is the type of ballpark where youre going to see home runs no lead is safe here you just have to find a way to outscore the other club
7402988 i was really concentrating on getting the ball down i wasnt able to and that made my whole effort go toward getting the ball down i kind of lost a feel for my breaking stuff and i wasnt able to get that over early in the count bottom line i threw too many pitches early and i was never able to recover from that

7403062 if the u s dollar is rising commodities take a hit its been a huge factor
7403063 we may see this rally in the u s dollar continue in the short term but you have to differentiate between speculation and the underlying demand for commodities
7403064 the majority of the increase in commodities over the last five years has been driven by demand from china and the emerging economies being so great that supplies havent been able to keep up

7403082 we came out a little slow had a couple turnovers which we cant have
7403083 today when we got into that slower tempo we didnt perform as well
7403084 if we cant get some consistency there then we are going to have to go for it on fourth down a lot
7403085 i think and i believe those guys will be ready
7403086 the last two days they have been kicking extremely well
7403087 even if we the wide receivers were healthy he would play
7403088 we wont be our best football team in that first ball game

7403091 i didnt know washington state was ahead in so many ways
7403092 we had a balk a wild pitch a homer errant throws walk off home run
7403093 we played for the cycle both teams across the board
7403094 i tried to get on base for matty i got a pretty good pitch to hit took a hack at it

7403102 we have reason to be exceedingly proud and every reason to look forward to the following years
7403103 i thought it was very meaningful to start out the freshmen class with a convocation
7403104 it was one of those days you dream about as a hitter

7403109 we want the student body to know more about what we do than they have in the past
7403110 we also want to put on diverse programming and appeal to all audiences our funding comes from student dollars so our number one priority is giving the students what they want
7403111 it is one of the fastest growing student organizations on campus
7403112 we will work at bringing something to campus that we think the students want and then get a reception completely different than expected
7403113 they field what the rest of the student body knows

7403158 today i wanted to provide an update on some information i posted back in july and also highlight some other exciting news that we came out with today

7403160 your number one source for news and information on urban living in columbus ohio
7403161 ive followed it a little but im still not quite sure what exactly the deal is
7403162 i know they laid a bunch of people off which made a lot of people mad then again lots of companies are laying off workers these days so who knows
7403163 i saw footage of people clearing out their offices even taking home plants from the lobby i know they went bankrupt and i think some of their top executives may have been guilty of some sort of extortion but i could be totally off
7403164 didnt the collapse have something to do with the california energy crunch
7403165 im pretty sure i saw something on the news about it being related to that but then i also read somewhere that there was some kind of trouble with their accounting so maybe it was both or neither
7403166 from what i gather some of the top enron executives predicted the earnings wrong and as a result they overbudgeted
7403167 so then they had to fire some people to make up for the loss and everybodys mad because the people they fired were all the low level employees not the top guys like themselves
7403168 a lot of people are saying a lot of things about this company
7403169 right now its all just a lot of noise im going to wait until the dust settles before i even consider trying to get a handle on it

7403177 it shows just how out of touch national politicians really are from the life of the people john mccain doesnt even know how many houses he and his wife own
7403178 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
7403179 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
7403180 couric asked about mccains answer when politico inquired about the number of homes he and his wife cindy own mccain referred the question to his staff who said he had at least four records show the number could be twice that depending on how you count the familys properties
7403181 i am grateful for the fact that i have a wonderful life
7403182 i spent some years without a kitchen table without a chair and i know what its like to be blessed by the opportunities of this great nation
7403183 the attitude of the great coordinations of the international communist movement towards nepali revolution
7403184 the existing coordinations and aggregations of the international communist movement do not yet express themselves on the meaning of nepali revolution
7403185 none of the various aggregations of communist parties and organizations can set itself even as an embryo of a new international if it does not overcome this difficulty if it just restricts itself to denounce revisionism and imperialism if it does not propose a course that could lead communists to victory in the imperialist and the semi colonial and oppressed countries according to the specific conditions of the ones and the others such proposals do not rise from some individual genius nor from the particular qualities of a single party or organization
7403186 the fact that they are able to denounce revisionists lies and imperialists crimes but they are not able to give their opinion or stutter about the situation in nepal where communists are advancing is a sign of their difficulties
7403187 aggregation suggests that they expect to be shaking up the alignments of communists internationally forging something new on a new basis
7403188 a course that could lead communists to victory in the imperialist and the semi colonial and oppressed countries according to the specific conditions of the ones and the others
7403189 rise from the open and frank debate among the various communist parties and organizations on the international level
7403190 this debate then must be united to the practical organizations in all the struggle fronts against imperialism for defending the conquests of the working class and the peoples masses the oppressed people and nations women young people environment etc and to mutual solidarity so doing the debate cannot be reduced to an empty and abstract talking the common practice will confirm which positions are right and which are not
7403191 if it does not propose a course that could lead communists to victory in the imperialist and the semi colonial and oppressed countries according to the specific conditions of the ones and the others
7403192 they rise from the open and frank debate among the various communist parties and organizations on the international level
7403193 such proposals do not rise from some individual genius nor from the particular qualities of a single party or organization
7403194 contrary to your believe rim had a tremendous impact on cpn m line to overcome its reformist vision and start the protracted peoples war in nepal so dont try to change that this has been in the official writing of cpn m itself you cant change the history of rim by puttying your destructive vision in the place of rim in international communist movement
7403195 i still dont see why radical left wing people in nyc think that there is any reason to work for the obama campaign so i am posting up a little piece of excellent flame bait
7403196 no one can see you you have only yourself to look to you are going to be completely isolated when you make your decision and afterwards you can hide that decision or lie about it
7403197 the small shopkeepers would not help us any more than the country people would
7403198 the man near me is other so i dont know how he would react
7403199 better he should read john locke more and rousseau less but perhaps his frenchness gets in the way
7403200 and it is one of the sad things of the last century that too much of the revolutionary movement has worn that case hardened shell of assault without also radiating a warm generosity and living solidarity toward those close and toward humanity as a whole
7403201 he meant real people reified not deified those who live and eat and work and cry and sing and fight and dream around us they are most precious love of them and fierce intolerance of their suffering is the motivation for all we communists do or at least it should be when we are seeing our world and its people clearly with all their writhing contradictions
7403202 what is to be done burning questions of our movement

7403206 the early christians were having a lot of difficulty getting people to join their movement
7403207 the law in its previous imperative is not is no longer tenable even for those who claim to follow it it is a principle of death for the suddenly ascendant truth badiou p 27
7403208 a shift from concern with this world toward preoccupation with the supposed next world p 81
7403209 this whole story of how the jews were the ones responsible for jesus being crucified is very improbable
7403210 was worked into the christian tradition about a century after the death of jesus
7403211 as a military outpost and instrument of u s imperialism in the world
7403212 in the christian world life has been hell to all those who have refused to practice christianity
7403213 have i gone into this to such an extent p 81

7403215 a smugly arrogant attitude towards religious fundamentalism and religion in general
7403216 it is a deep form of contempt for the masses to fail to take seriously the deep belief that many of them have in religion
7403217 in the fight against injustice and oppression to unite as broadly as possible with people who continue to hold religious beliefs
7403218 for god so loved the world that he gave his only son so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life
7403219 what it is actually putting forward and what it is actually promoting p 122
7403220 underlying this very verse is the notion that humanity is all screwed up thats the first point to keep in mind here
7403221 was not a supernatural being part of the same substance of god the father and at the same time the son of god
7403222 here i wont attempt to further explore the arcane christian doctrine of the trinity
7403223 and then theres this whole matter of the holy spirit
7403224 role is to be the loving long suffering mother of jesus
7403225 a kind of intercessor for people in their supplications to god
7403226 a powerful father figure in a human form is not enough for many people
7403227 the image of an all knowing all seeing all powerful god for whom lo the powerful head of state is a representative
7403228 let us be clear female children and children in general should not be seen and treated as the property of their parents and their father in particular
7403229 an unmistakable suggestion of a final solution against the masses of people in the inner cities
7403230 i didnt come here to tell you what you want to hear
7403231 oppressed people who are unable or unwilling to confront reality as it actually is are condemned to remain enslaved and oppressed
7403232 the most prophetic intellectual and spiritual leader of our generation
7403233 family values agenda with an spiritually based anti war pro science progressive agenda of their own avakian concedes there is much on which to unite with lerner p 160 but criticizes him on a number of points
7403234 vast majority are motivated by principles and who want what is best for the world
7403235 is true because it is effective not because it gives us factual information but because it gives us deeper insight into the meaning of life
7403236 but shouldnt one ask why following the defeat of the socialist revolutions in the ussr and china people have flocked to religious movements why were the efforts to inculcate atheism so disappointingly partial and so quickly reversible might they have been too crudely and insensitively applied based on imperfect analysis of this phenomenon of religious belief
7403237 this new synthesis involves a recasting and recombining of the positive aspects of the experience so far of the communist movement and of socialist society while learning from the negative aspects of this experience in the philosophical and ideological as well as the political dimensions so as to have a more deeply and firmly rooted scientific orientation method and approach with regard not only to making revolution and seizing power but then yes to meeting the material requirements of society and the needs of the masses of people in an increasingly expanding way in socialist society overcoming the deep scars of the past and continuing the revolutionary transformation of society while at the same time actively supporting the world revolutionary struggle and acting on the recognition that the world arena and the world struggle are most fundamental and important in an overall sense together with opening up qualitatively more space to give expression to the intellectual and cultural needs of the people broadly understood and enabling a more diverse and rich process of exploration and experimentation in the realms of science art and culture and intellectual life overall with increasing scope for the contention of different ideas and schools of thought and for individual initiative and creativity and protection of individual rights including space for individuals to interact in civil society independently of the state all within an overall cooperative and collective framework and at the same time as state power is maintained and further developed as a revolutionary state power serving the interests of the proletarian revolution in the particular country and worldwide with this state being the leading and central element in the economy and in the overall direction of society while the state itself is being continually transformed into something radically different from all previous states as a crucial part of the advance toward the eventual abolition of the state with the achievement of communism on a world scale
7403238 and a lot of marxist writers could learn a lot stylistically from early avakian you can explain complex ideas to the masses in simple language you dont have to mutter in jargonese to do it
7403239 who spent a lot of time at expensive ivy league universities
7403240 we shouldnt understand this principle im articulating in a fill in the blank with seven different synonyms for
7403241 by combining a mostly positive but critical assessment of this history with some new ideas about what socialism ought to be in the future
7403242 zizek and other philosophers do not write for the masses
7403243 the big words are used to exclude certain people the great mass of people actually from the conversation
7403244 remember its us the working class who are going to have to carry out the revolution thats going to be needed to make those ideas a material force
7403245 well we dont thing socialism is possible until the far distant future so for now were fighting for capitalism an elected president and developement through foreign owned sweatshops thats what we want you to pick up a rifle and fight and die for
7403246 voting for the democratic party because we think they are the lesser of two evils
7403247 you cant be a gay communist cause we dont like being around gay people and the straight masses dont like gay folks either
7403248 i happen to believe that you can explain quite complicated ideological concepts in everyday language
7403249 i happen to believe that you can explain quite complicated ideological concepts in everyday language
7403250 i want to have a dialogue with the russians i want them to get out of georgian territory as quickly as possible and i am interested in good relations between the united states and russia but in the 21st century nations dont invade other nations
7403251 the georgian army had no chance of winning a war with russia or any intention of occupying the territory they captured
7403252 cases of possible threats by russia directed at georgia with the intention of taking control over the baku ceyhan pipeline
7403253 russia actively tends to isolate the central asian region from direct access to world economy especially to energy supplies if georgia government is destabilized western access to baku caspian sea and further will be limited
7403254 ever since the continents started interacting politically some five hundred years ago eurasia has been the center of world power the key to controlling eurasia is controlling the central asian republics
7403255 we have an imperialist country invading its former colony a colony where it has continued to occupy 10 of their national territory during the course of their 17 years of independence
7403256 the u s instigating an ally in the caucasus into conflict with russia
7403257 to reiterate in light of those facts we shoud unconditionally support military victory for the georgian army and defeat for the russian army while not politically supporting either side
7403258 the attack was short sharp and deadly enough to send the georgians fleeing in humiliating panic
7403259 the workers of the world are behind the stars and stripes
7403260 what is to be done with the mingrelians the abkhasians the adjarians the svanetians the lesghians and so on who speak different languages but do not possess a literature of their own
7403261 of course not one of the regions constitute a compact homogeneous nation for each is interspersed with national minorities such are the jews in poland the letts in lithuania the russians in the caucasus the poles in the ukraine and so on it may be feared there fore that the minorities will be oppressed by the national majorities but there will be grounds for fear only if the old order continues to prevail in the country give the country complete democracy and all grounds for fear will vanish it is proposed to bind the dispersed minorities into a single national union but what the minorities want is not an artificial union but real rights in the localities they inhabit what can such a union give them without complete democratisation on the other hand what need is there for a national union when there is complete democratisation what is it that particularly agitates a national minority a minority is discontented not because there is no national union but because it does not enjoy the right to use its native language etc permit the use of native language and the discontent will pass of itself a minority is discontented not because there is no artificial union but because it does not possess its own schools give schools and grounds for discontent will disappear a minority is discontented not because there is no national union but because it does not enjoy liberty of conscience religious liberty liberty of movement etc give it these liberties and it will cease to be discontented thus equal rights of nations in all forms language schools etc is an essential element in the solution of the national question consequently a state law based on complete democratisation of the country is required prohibiting all national privileges without exception and every kind of disability or restriction on the rights of national minorities that and that alone is the real not a paper guarantee of the rights of a minority
7403262 and i must say any hint that we should support the u s intervention in georgia or support its nasty little proxy force is deeply mistake
7403263 the west has wanted to break up big multinational states and make them smaller but it has had a fetish about preserving the boundaries of the individual component parts that either tito created in yugoslavia or stalin created in the soviet union and it doesnt want to accept that within many of these states you have a matrioschkal doll if you like of minorities within minorities and very often small nationalisms are even more unpleasant than big nationalisms at least to smaller people who live among them
7403264 and to show how there is a certain continuity despite the change in the regime to a youthful thrusting regime in 2003 with the rose revolution you should remember that james baker went in 1992 to endorse eduard shevardnadze shook hands with the leader of the main para military group mkhdrioni gabrioslini and he of course went in 2003 to say it was time for eduard shevardnadze to go to give way to mikheil saakashvili educated at columbia washington law school and so on
7403265 i was thinking earlier today in fact that my academic career would have prospered if i had suffered more from amnesia because i wouldnt keep remembering that our governments senior politicians for that matter commentators and experts had endorsed as boundlessly reform minded tremendously successful democrats and principled humanists people who within a few years they suddenly discover are corrupt people manipulating the local economy stealing foreign aid and running the regime for their own benefit
7403266 a lot of the problems with president saakashvili was that even if i was always inclined to be skeptical about his promise that he could clean up georgian politics put the economy back to work end the terrible poverty in georgia that existed throughout the 1990s and even btw reintegrate abkhazia and south ossetia peacfully i was always skeptical of that but none the less many georgians i suspect hoped that it would happen
7403267 after all he had the support of the americans maybe this time with the american aid and european aid would actually put bread on the table get hospitals with medicine perhaps the model of the europeans and the americans would stop torture in the prisons
7403268 i once asked a prison governor was it true that political prisoners were tortured he said we beat everybody who comes in here we make no distinctions
7403269 and in fact the cynicism is quite striking every time i go to an election which is endorsed as totally free and fair by the international osc observers i also go to the prisons and they say oh its you oh yes you can come in you can see how awful it is and so on because we know that none of the powerful people will take any notice
7403270 and on monday night i was on channel 4 news with bruce george leader of the election observers and he said nobody listens to mark hes the only person that says this apart from russians and then he added with that new labor racism that distinguishes our society today after all he doesnt seem to know that russians are russians they are natural imperialists we brits may feel that when it comes to no1 imperialists surely we have some claim to have led the world even russia was never quite as big as our empire
7403271 but just to take a continuity from 1993 to the present day some of you might have seen the very plausible very passionate georgian ambassador to the united nations irakli alasania his father was killed in 1993 as one in charge of the para militaries in sukhumi in the fighting with the abkhazians theres a grudge match here but the alasania family is also an important clan in georgian politics mr saakashvilis father abandoned his mother when he was a child and she married an alasania
7403272 if you look at almost any aspect of economic political life particularly defense procurement and remember georgia spends 70 of its budget on defense youll find oddly enough the alasania family name just keeps popping up its a career open to talent
7403273 btw this talent is very helpful in helping to shape opinion in the west you may have seen that senator john mccain is a forthright supporter of georgia demands that america acts to defend georgia his chief campaign advisor randy shoinerman sp received 900 000 from georgia to act as a lobbyist for georgia now those of us who know georgia will be surprised that an amount of money that would probably keep 3 000 people living happily for a year in georgian terms is given out
7403274 the continuity between shevardnadze and saakahsvili are not only corruptionary predilections torture and so on but its also the desire to integrate with the west
7403275 we no longer have a divide between political parties its one thing in a time of national crisis when your own country is threatened say 1940 to see all the parties rally together but we now have no discernable difference of opinion among political parties in western countries certainly not in britain and america about foreign policy and i think its a sign of the decay of democratic debate and is not a healthy thing at all
7403276 its the domino effect its really a proxy war for the russians or more particularly the communists look at the red arrows coming down
7403277 it seems to me that in the short term president saakashvili will survive because it would be to embarrassing for the americans for him to go but once the u s election is over in november he will be quietly removed i was in a bbc studio with a georgian spokesman defending saakashvili and as we left the studio he turned to me and said he is such an idiot he should be shot and of course when georgians say that it is not to be taken lightly
7403278 proxy war fighting army will cross the caucuses and march on moscow or turn south to teach those ungreatfull turks what for or over to iran to deal with them
7403279 saakashvili when he was campaigning to come to power said that he would live in a ordinary two room apartment with the people
7403280 what was interesting was that in the car filming me while the georgian policeman dealt with this was an obviously non georgian person he couldnt be more american if he tried
7403281 a great extraordinary aspect of this whole conflict is the americans have spent vast amounts of money training the georgian army and they the us went to iraq after all one of the great ironies of this whole situation as we hear condoleezza rice david miliband and so on saying you cannot in the 21st century invade a foreign country you cannot in the 21st century want regime change
7403282 now no doubt this is all very bad but who are we to say
7403283 but the interesting thing that the lessons that saakashvili seems to have learnt and his army seems to have learnt are unfortunately from the iraqi army the debacle of the iraqi army the collapse and disintegration rather than perhaps what the americans wanted to teach
7403284 its an index of the poverty of georgia that i once was talking to an american soldier who was training some kind of missile system there and he said the great problem with training the georgians is that they get paid 30 dollars a day a huge amount of money a monthly income for these sort of peoples so tengis comes one day to learn how to set up the equipment and then his cousin temur comes the next day and then the next day along comes somebody else thomas beecham had this problem with orchestras different people trying to come to rehearsals but its no way to fight a war now if you have an army like that then perhaps the best thing is to be neutral and not to fight a war
7403285 i think myself coming to this central point the real clash between russia and georgia of course is a geopolitical clash between russia and america the expansion of nato
7403286 the tragedy for the georgians is that they are pawns in between and the best solution would be the solution that actually during the cold war was found take austria in 1955 eisenhower and eden could deal with krushchev and melancov and agree that austria should be neutral and make a state treaty why do we have to have youre either with us or against us why cant we have neutrality why has neutrality had to die
7403287 it seems to me that georgia is the classic example of a small country that could have been neutralized would not have had to waste money on weapons that turn out to be essentially self destructive
7403288 might have had some chance to devote its resources and its energies to economic improvement which has not taken place despite reading the economist or the financial times it has 11 growth
7403289 georgians soviet people in general used to say we produce everything in this country but most of all statistics laughter its one of the ironies of the post cold war situation that the kind of nonsensical statistics which were produced in a stalinist command economy are now produced in what is supposedly a free market competitive economy but they bear no more resemblance to reality than they did in 1937 and on that tragic comic note i will stop thank you for your attention
7403290 my eyes glaze over at this discussion does anybody here claim to have the slightest possibility of influencing events with their analysis if not what is the point
7403291 lots of what happens in the world doesnt strike me as involving either the russians or the americans to any great extent for example there was recently a maoist revolution in nepal nobody thinks the russians are involved only some indian chauvinists talk about china being involved and they equally suspect pakistan and claims that the us was or could be involved in events in a landlocked himalayan country sandwiched between india and china strike me as unconvincing even if ambassador moriarty thought otherwise
7403292 why people like your slef the lord has blessed you
7403293 i do not support roe versus wade it should be overturned
7403294 the thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine hes erratic hes hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
7403295 lebih baik gw mati daripada harus merasakan hal seperti ini lagi
7403296 theyre a playoff team so we knew what to expect we came out the second half with a good drive and really got into a groove thats what our offense is all about when you play playoff caliber teams its going to be tough
7403297 you cant put it on one person on one i made a call late and somebody thought i did the snap count but i was just trying to move the protection just things like that through the preseason you still work on those things and hopefully you get all those kinks worked out
7403298 you cant go into the season and make that many mistakes its already hard enough to win a game so if you create penalties and set yourself back its even harder
7403299 you just have to let guys play so they can get a little bit of a feel as opposed to a series then pull them out and put somebody else in
7403300 would i have liked to see booty the whole second half yeah i would have
7403301 judge not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
7403302 s avonds zitten puzzelen met sudoku henk ook t v gekeken en om half een ging ik naar bed

7403305 zaabiz has entered the indian market because we see a great opportunity the challenge however is to bring out the true efficacies and benefits of our platform which can then be optimised to achieve greater benefits
7403306 please excuse me but im planning to teach my child not to let strangers get personal with him so i had better practice that myself
7403307 is going to be my breakout year the year i finally stopped being invisible
7403308 look at you all waiting for that obama text on the vp watch
7403309 hes a rocker thats their idea of a rocker some dude from missouri with bangs
7403310 if i took a photo like that with my dad both of us would be vomiting in the photo
7403311 let no one be found among you who is a medium or spiritist who consults the dead
7403312 we created a chance and it was great pass from megan and a great shot from kiersten up a goal at halftime we knew the adjustments we needed to make and we executed well in the second half
7403313 we came out a little slow had a couple turnovers which we cant have
7403314 today when we got into that slower tempo we didnt perform as well
7403315 if we cant get some consistency there then we are going to have to go for it on fourth down a lot
7403316 i think and i believe those guys will be ready
7403317 the last two days they have been kicking extremely well
7403318 even if we the wide receivers were healthy he would play
7403319 we wont be our best football team in that first ball game
7403320 we need to be able to look forward have a great week working against other concepts and schemes
7403321 i feel like as long as we keep getting better each and every day and everybody comes willing to work we will be ready for oklahoma state next week
7403322 they were pretty fired up to run with him the day he was here
7403323 they went out on one of our long run courses
7403324 i was hanging on for dear life with him and he was barely breaking a sweat so it was a little bit humbling it was a lot of fun i mean its not every day you get to run with a world champion
7403325 i wanted to do something that combined my love for kids and family
7403326 i thought i would do something with my educational background
7403327 ive been asked to stop smoking or i must leave
7403328 well one of the things the bar and restaurant owners are suing the city over is the anti smoking laws are very vague
7403329 but the lawyers for the city at circuit court for our lawsuit on the smoking ban said that once the bar or restaurant owner tells the customer they cant smoke and if they keep doing it they have to leave the owners obligation is over
7403330 at our meeting with the health department a couple of weeks ago they told us they were pretty much just giving the bar and restaurant owners the tickets and if the customers put their cigarettes out they didnt give them a ticket
7403331 so i said you mean the people who break the law are being given a pass and the places trying to prevent the law from being broken are being given the ticket whats wrong with this picture
7403332 and they said well they wouldnt say it like that but i think thats exactly whats happening
7403333 theyre to ensure that once the bar owner has given the customer a warning we give them a sticker
7403334 so people know that our obligation as bar and restaurant owners is over and the city shouldnt give us a ticket its beyond ridiculous we put a smiley face on it because we want to be customer friendly we dont want to insult anybody we want to keep things on a friendly basis so we can keep our customers
7403335 and im teamed up with some tv guys here in denver from l a were going to go around and interview people and see what we can find
7403336 i dont have credentials so were going to have to steer into the turn a little bit and because i left the radio station were going to be on the periphery
7403337 in light of the fact that we dont have credentials were going to try to turn lemons into lemonade and go down there like the average guy not like im
7403338 youre so lucky not to be one of those revved up go go go people in the morning people are going to love being around such a calm person
7403339 and we made sure that that did not happen again
7403340 you americans kind of make those great sitcoms where six really attractive people all hang out and moan about not getting partners and live in massive great apartments and moan about not having any money thats sort of not the show that ruth and i ever wanted to make
7403341 the stuff that we like is the stuff that i guess holds a mirror up to the world that we live in and the world that we care about and so ultimately we just wanted to tell a truthful romantic love story which hopefully was really funny
7403342 one of the funniest things that ive found on tour is when i look out in the audience i see people with a home depot apron hat or a shirt and theyre pointing to it like hey check this out
7403343 usually if youve got an apron youre an employee or youve got a pretty good in because they dont give those out to everybody
7403344 i feel ive always used acting in my life as a survival technique
7403345 thats why i dont really feel at times that im a real actor who does his homework and all that stuff i got into acting when i was pretty young it was a response to when i was younger and was thinking about something and my mother would say to me get that miserable look off your face id say oh im not miserable now somebody pays me to do it i constantly question it and i constantly question the value of it and see that it sort of perpetuates those insecurities
7403346 we have not received it yet the manufacturer is dragging its heels
7403347 nobody has received it to my knowledge in the united states if they did we would have them but its going to be big and the reason its going to be big is because ledger is dead not because ledger is terrific
7403348 made a phone call and we jacked up that order if he hadnt died it would have been nothing because the jokers been out before
7403349 rarely does something come out where the guys can make something look good theres always a lot of things for girls
7403350 wearing the joker costume a colonial costume the patriot a cowboy costume brokeback mountain or a knight costume a knights tale and a black ribbon
7403351 its a shame that somebodys death creates this kind of stir
7403352 how many times can you be a pirate for halloween
7403353 once the missile defense system is put in place it will work automatically with the entire nuclear capability of the united states it will be an integral part of the us nuclear capability and for the first time in history and i want to emphasize this there will be elements of the us nuclear capability on the european continent it simply changes the whole configuration of international security of course we have to respond to that
7403354 us missiles in europe beyond deterrence to first strike threat
7403355 by means of a us first strike about 99 of russian nuclear forces would be taken out
7403356 some people have the illusion that you can do everything just as you want regardless of the interests of other people of course it is for precisely this reason that the international situation gets worse and eventually results in an arms race but we are not the instigators we do not want it why would we want to divert resources to this and we are not jeopardizing our relations with anyone but we must respond name even one step that we have taken or one action of ours designed to worsen the situation there are none we are not interested in that we are interested in maintaining a good atmosphere
7403357 it would be better to look for other ways to fight terrorism than create low yield nuclear weapons that lower the threshold for using these weapons and thereby put humankind on the brink of nuclear catastrophe
7403358 i am convinced that we have reached that decisive moment when we must seriously think about the architecture of global security
7403359 the need for respect for the archaeological historical cultural and religious heritage of iraq and for the continued protection of archaeological historical cultural and religious sites museums libraries and monuments
7403360 we reaffirm our commitment to protect iraqs natural resources as the patrimony of the people of iraq which should be used only for their benefit
7403361 it was there in what the greeks called mesopotamia that life as we know it today began there people first began to speculate on philosophy and religion developed concepts of international trade made ideas of beauty into tangible forms and above all developed the skill of writing
7403362 the heirs of a great civilization that contributes to all humanity
7403363 youd have to go back centuries to the mongol invasion of baghdad in 1258 to find looting on this scale
7403364 i thought i was given assurances that sites and museums would be protected
7403365 persuading the pentagon to relax legislation that protects iraqs heritage by prevention of sales abroad
7403366 merit securing as soon as possible to prevent further damage destruction and or pilferage of records and assets
7403367 coalition forces must secure these facilities in order to prevent looting and the resulting irreparable loss of cultural treasures
7403368 our troops who have been proudly guarding the oil ministry where no window is broken deliberately condoned these horrendous events
7403369 cracks and gaps where somebody had tried to gouge out the decorated bricks forming the famous dragons of the ishtar gate
7403370 2 600 year old brick pavement crushed by military vehicles
7403371 between may and august 2004 the wall of the temple of nabu and the roof of the temple of ninmah both of the sixth century b
7403372 at least 8 000 treasures looted from iraq museum still untraced
7403373 library books letters and priceless documents are set ablaze in final chapter of the sacking of baghdad
7403374 pentagon was told of risk to museums u s urged to save iraqs historic artifacts
7403375 this has been a hard but well considered decision and we believe it is the best one for all concerned
7403376 due to the bad weather we have been delayed in putting the infrastructure in place and it is a big concern that the weather conditions will hugely dampen the experience we want to give all our festival goers
7403377 postponing the festival will mean that we can give everyone the fflam festival experience they deserve bands organisers and festival goers alike
7403378 we expect the new date to be at the end of the summer and are doing all we can do get everything reorganised as quickly and efficiently as possible so that we can confirm the date within the week
7403379 we have to remember that industrial design equals mass production and that every move every decision every curve we specify is multiplied sometimes by the thousands and often by the millions and that every one of those everys has a price we think that were in the artifact business but were not were in the consequence business
7403380 the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment
7403381 we believe that the key to creating large scale greenhouse savings is via a sustainable business model where financial health and sustainability are core business goals
7403382 scientists in the united states say planting and preserving trees in some parts of the world may in fact make the earth hotter in less than 100 years forests will have made some places up to 12 degrees warmer
7403383 when sunlight comes in from the sun and strikes the surface of the earth some of its reflected back to space but when it hits trees then only around 15 per cent of it gets reflected back to space and so most energy in that sunlight stays on the earth on the surface and causes it to be warmer than it would otherwise be

7403390 dat je altijd naar jezelf aan het staren bent waarom doe je dat
7403391 je zit in mijn hoofd je bestaat niet ik hoef je geen antwoord te geven als ik niet wil
7403392 nee dat is niet alles ik kijk naar mezelf om te controleren of ik er nog ben om me rot te kunnen voelen als mijn haar weer pluist om te schrikken van de grootte van mijn neus en profil om te bekijken of de kleding die ik s morgens uitgezocht heb wel echt staat om de verhoudingen te controleren en om er steeds achter te komen dat ik nooit tevreden zal zijn maar
7403393 ik kijk ook omdat ik mooi ben om te zien hoe slank mijn handen hoe blauw mijn ogen en de welving van mijn nek omdat ik steeds opnieuw getroffen ben om te kijken naar een werk immens geavanceerder dan ik me voor kan stellen en t ch mag ik het gebruiken ik kijk omdat ik geschapen ben omdat iemand mij bedacht heeft uitgetekend en tot slot vol liefde ontworpen omdat ik perfect ben omdat ik ondanks al mijn tekortkomingen en ondanks al mijn fouten omdat ik ondanks alles wat me niet zint of wat niet voldoet aan het ideaalbeeld omdat ik ondanks alles volmaakt ben omdat besloten is dat ik zo moet zijn en het goed was
7403394 vandaag ben je alles vandaag ben je iedereen die ik me kan wensen en vandaag vervul je al mijn dromen met een kinderlijk gemak vandaag maak je alles goed wat je gisteren verpestte vandaag ontdek ik jou zoals ik je ooit kwijtraakte vandaag verdien je mijn liefde terug

7403416 its about the lies we tell them about fame and money and whats beautiful and what will give them life its an apology for those lies but more than that its an invitation to the truth about a god who is bigger than the pain this world so often leaves them in

7403418 you know the truth is that right after 9 11 i had a pin shortly after 9 11 particularly because as were talking about the iraq war that became a substitute for i think true patriotism which is speaking out on issues that are of importance to our national security i decided i wont wear that pin on my chest

7403427 kita bicara di depan saja biar lebih santai bapak lagi ada tamu
7403428 sebenarnya sejak dulu bapak sangat sibuk tapi sesibuk apapun selalu menyempatkan diri bertemu dan berkomunikasi dengan anak anak setelah pulang kantor pasti beliau menanyakan kondisi dan apa apa saja yang dilakukan putri putri kami
7403429 kalau tak ada komunikasi bisa biasa terjadi salah sangka dan pertengkaran
7403430 apa saja kita bicarakan saling berbagi pokoknya kadang kadang kalau cucu sudah bangun ikutan juga bisa menghilangkan penat dan stres
7403431 potensi perempuan di padang sangat bagus tapi kurang didukung saja

7403440 if we create or become a mirror image of the religious right we have failed
7403441 but if we have increased the number of chairs around the table then weve succeeded
7403442 people of faith are being engaged in the convention in a new and robust way and its because of senator obamas acknowledgment that people of faith and values have an important place in american public life
7403443 now theres a genuine interest in speaking with groups and religious groups who were previously considered enemies
7403444 this big push is making people crazy thinking theyre bad moms if they dont get their kids vaccinated
7403445 merck lobbied every opinion leader womens group medical society politicians and went directly to the people it created a sense of panic that says you have to have this vaccine now

7403454 particularly during the sars epidemic xinhua has for last few months been putting out news reports embarrassing to the government but they are designed to fool the international community since they are not published in chinese
7403455 nikes are red meat where we come from and we always want the finer things to eat
7403456 while we were able to preserve some family bibles the storm was extraordinary and unfortunately many were swept away
7403457 we are sorry that we were not able to keep the pact we made with families who wanted their bibles preserved
7403458 y et also from the book of life we know white people will refuse gods commandment and not voluntarily relinquish their goods in late 2006 and early 2007 st thief toured the country admonishing whites of the new commandment of god that their possessions were to be given over exodus 8 3 the plague of the frogs and the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly which shall go up and come into thine house
7403459 an interpretation of the plague of the frogs is that it represents a period when the israelites began to act ugly toward the egyptians who enslaved them
7403460 from defacing their valuables and monuments to pissing in the nile river the israelites did every despicable thing they could to their slave masters the kind of situation we want here
7403461 in the book of revelations the book of life is the book that comes when the bible is expired sisters and brothers
7403462 fellow bloggers know me as a liberal writer these acts committed today are the most reprehensible by any blacks i have ever seen public protest is necessary this type of protest is unacceptable and will not progress black causes it will only further divide and cause ill feelings between the races

7403464 een normaal persoon gebruikt de emmer omdat die groter is dan een lepel of een kop

7403469 het resultaat van de gang van zaken vanaf het moment dat wij uit elkaar zijn kon alleen maar minder dan een pyrrhusoverwinning opleveren
7403470 ik verschool me achter haar zonder zelf hoe pijnlijk ook echt bij te dragen aan dit proces
7403471 childhood is a crucial time when bodies are growing and brains are developing its so important to fuel the body with good nutrition and teaching children smart eating habits at a young age is a great idea it starts with the parents serving as the role model
7403472 when children consume a high fat high sugar meal their bodies will crash and they will become very tired and lethargic which is not going to help them perform at their best level in school
7403473 a smart dinner will help your childs brain function if they are satisfied after dinnertime then they will sleep through the night and a child needs at least eight to nine hours of sleep a night in order to function while in the school the next day
7403474 if you are concerned about carcinogens marinating a product and this would be any kind of muscle food product is a good way to dramatically reduce the formation of hcas
7403475 actually a grill runs at higher temp so the effect probably would be more dramatic
7403476 then you can cook it really well done and have no hcas
7403477 vegetarian cooking on the grill isnt going to give you any of these things
7403478 ive been fighting alongside acorn on issues you care about my entire career even before i was an elected official when i ran project vote voter registration drive in illinois acorn was smack dab in the middle of it and we appreciate your work
7403479 barack obamas failure to accurately report his campaigns financial records is an incredibly suspicious situation that appears to be an attempt to hide his campaigns interaction with a left wing organization previously convicted of voter fraud for a candidate who claims to be practicing new politics his fec reports look an awful lot like the old style chicago politics of yesterday
7403480 raised by a foreign national through a number of contributors who werent even supporting mccain
7403481 were an ally organization of csi we work with them on various projects csi is a different company altogether acorn is a community organization
7403482 acorn is a client of ours acorn has a lot of different partner organizations we are a partner but we are separate
7403483 municipal living wage laws targeting big box stores like wal mart rolling back welfare reform and regulating banks efforts styled as combating predatory lending
7403484 they unloaded a busload of people shouting pretty ugly things and scared the daylights out of my wife and kids
7403485 i thought it was a pretty cruddy thing to do
7403486 sure enough a bit of digging into obamas years in the illinois state senate indicates strong concern with acorns signature issues as well as meetings with acorn and the introduction by obama of acorn friendly legislation on the living wage and banking practices
7403487 what it came down to was that senator obama is the candidate who best understands and can affect change on the issues acorn cares about like stopping foreclosures enacting fair and comprehensive reform and building stronger and safer communities across america
7403488 hey vicki you are doing a good job working in every department

7403490 when he had darker hair it was pretty obvious he had larger plugs
7403491 with the lightening of his hair it looks much much better now
7403492 and a typical session is 1 000 to 2 000 grafts
7403493 a lot of people have touch up work and he may have had some
7403494 i think he should darken the hair on the top of his head
7403495 one of the reasons being with it being lighter than the rest of the hair it makes it appear to be thinner
7403496 in my view his haircut and style do not complement his squarish face shape
7403497 a forward comb with a serrated fringe would soften that
7403498 i mean its really common for a lot of guys
7403499 transplant hair if a good one can be cut and styled almost exactly like your real hair

7403522 national security is supposed to be a major theme for the democratic national convention especially with joe biden now obamas running mate
7403523 inviting a speaker with documented ties to extremist terrorists makes a complete mockery of this emphasis on national security
7403524 democratic presidential nominee barack obama and the democratic party should not allow an individual who sympathizes with murderous terrorists to speak at a peaceful interfaith gathering

7403563 it was against everything i was about everyone was just trying to prove a point there were times when i wouldnt even get up to go into the huddle with the team
7403564 he can pull up take it to the hole or face up and shoot it its too hard to stop him
7403565 he uses his body well is very physical and can also shoot it from deep
7403566 people said i was cocky but i didnt want to take a picture with someone so young who hopefully one day ill get to play against in the nba

7403651 experience teaches us that life is something fluctuant and uncertain full of surprises that remain unpredictable however hard we may try to foresee them of course they are unpredictable because they are brought about by laws that we do not know and that we will probably never get to know either any thinker dealing with fixed systems artificial organisms is bound to suffer from disillusionment the fact that artificial organisms are flexible and all their components are replaceable facilitates up to a point our being prepared for the unexpected lets say for the predictability of the unexpected even and to be prepared means to move at the right moment from the indefinite towards the definite all organizers sin by drawing the detailed contour of all studied and written organisms they do not take into account whatever is fluctuant and uncertain the more intelligent they are the worse their work is exactly because it will be more valuable intellectually and not only intellectually they apply the thinking pattern that is used to make up thrillers and philosophical systems

7403673 we cannot stand them and we detained many of them recently many of them were part of al qaeda despite the fact that many of them are helping us to fight al qaeda
7403674 the state cannot accept the awakening their days are numbered
7403675 some people from the government encouraged us to fight against al qaeda but it seems that now that al qaeda is finished they dont want us anymore so how can you say i am not betrayed
7403676 sacrificed and fought against al qaeda and now the government wants to catch them and arrest them
7403677 these people are like cancer and we must remove them
7403678 like a drug addict who quits only to take drugs again
7403679 had to be seen by any serious observer as trying to substitute a western sphere of influence for russian
7403680 a kind of glorified organization for security and cooperation in europe
7403681 making trouble on everything in order to have some leverage
7403682 i think it was a case of wanting to get georgia engaged before the window of opportunity closed
7403683 are not capable of enforcing the taiwan model in georgia their army in the caucasus is not strong enough to calm down the situation in their own territory i dont think they are ready for any kind of an adventure in somebody elses territory and hopefully they know it
7403684 and whoever is perpetrating it and ive mentioned this to the president there should not be violence
7403685 saakashvilis buddies in the white house and the office of the vice president kept egging him on
7403686 remember the 18 4 billion that congress appropriated at the urgent request of the president of the united states in the fall of 03 for which i helped floor manage and took on the responsibility along with others to push hard because i believe there is a nexus between the reconstruction and the physical safety and possible success of our military in the region just 6 billion of that 18 4 billion has been spent
7403687 success as i define it is leaving iraq better than we found it
7403688 many americans have already concluded that we cannot salvage iraq we should bring all our forces home as soon as possible they include some of the most respected voices on military matters in this country like congressman jack murtha theyre mindful of the terrible consequences from withdrawing but even worse in their judgment would be to leave americans to fight and to die in iraq with no strategy for success i share their frustration but im not there yet i still believe we can preserve our fundamental security interests in iraq as we begin to redeploy our forces
7403689 as david brooks reminded us in the new york times enemy aliens
7403690 some democrats have been pleading with obama to use mccains tough response to the russian invasion of georgia to paint him as a trigger happy interventionist who would risk bringing a war weary nation into military conflict in regions where the united states has no interest
7403691 for those democrats bidens conclusions from his trip may be a disappointment
7403692 consultations with georgian president mikheil saakashvili georgian prime minister lado gurgenidze georgian parliamentary speaker david bakradze and u s ambassador to georgia john tefft left the democratic senator seemingly as angry as mccain is
7403693 i left the country convinced that russias invasion of georgia may be the one of the most significant event to occur in europe since the end of communism
7403694 tragically one person is deceased as a result of the incident one person is currently being treated for hypothermia
7403695 theyre refuges in some respects for last remnants of some vegetation were talking about birds and fish speaking about fish for example weve got aquatic submerged vegetation which is pretty much just confined to some of these reaches of water here in the finniss
7403696 it would be devastating salt water couldnt be supplied into this river and see it survive so there would have to be some way of keeping it out
7403697 if we start putting weirs or regulators across any sections of the wetlands around here its a negative and would only be contemplated as a last resort to try and conserve this area here and in turn would spell a significant impact on the lakes
7403698 i mean the interchange between the currency and the finniss and the lake as an integrated whole theyre very important to each other
7403699 in the first year that we came there was a very good flow and there was a flow for most of the year
7403700 since we have been here its just progressively got worse particularly during the summer months and in the last season last summer it didnt flow at all
7403701 it was just heart wrenching to see the aridness that was down there and what was normally very lush surroundings even the trees there was no birdlife everything was just starting to disappear
7403702 we have over allocation here and we need to address it
7403703 weve got seven sites that we go to around the catchments sort of evenly spaced around the catchment the meadows creek and bull creek both flow into the finniss and we just try and keep track of whats happening in those places with salinity and nitrates and phosphates
7403704 it gives you a bit of an idea if theres too much fertiliser coming off peoples land and flowing into the rivers and upsetting the sort of balance and we also look at macroinvertebrates so looking at the little critters to see whos alive and how theyre doing
7403705 i think the governments a bit scared that theyre going to get a lot of court action about youve taken away my livelihood because you wont let me have my water
7403706 we know it is tight but we know with proper perspective and proper management proper priority on this area this can be saved and after all this is one of our icon sites

7403725 keputusan ini menaikkan harga sangat gegabah yang terjadi begitu dinaikkan secara berkala konsumen 12 kg akan lari ke 3 kg nah konsumen elpiji 3 kg akan balik lagi mencari minyak tanah jadi alih alih mengecilkan subsidi justru akan membengkakkan subsidi kalo orang berbondong bondong cari minyak tanah karena elpiji langka maka pemerintah kan mau tidak mau menggelontorkan minyak tanah hemat saya pertamina tidak mau rugi saya curiga akan mendorong orang untuk mencari minyak tanah karena memang sudah ada yang mau supply minyak tanah
7403726 elpiji ini barang banci kalau dibilang barang tidak bersubsidi kenyatannya disubsidi kalau barang bersubsidi kenyataannya tidak ada peraturan yang menyatakan bersubsidi padahal ini barang yang menguasai hajat hidup orang banyak sudah waktunya pemerintah menetapkan barang ini sebagai barang semi subsidi artinya tidak disubsidi secara penuh

7403752 lembaga peradilan kita telah terbelit sistem korup yang sudah merata di semua lini maka kehadiran ky sangat penting untuk mengawasi perilaku aparatnya ini urgensi sosiologis yang dikesampingkan untuk memunculkan hakim yang kredibel
7403753 semakin baik pengadilan dan kejaksaan menata kelembagaan termasuk personel mereka maka semakin cepat pula ky tak begitu dibutuhkan lagi
7403754 tetapi kalau mentalitas korup itu kan tidak serta merta dipatahkan butuh waktu bagi ky untuk bekerja keras dalam sisa periode ini dan berlanjut ke depannya
7403755 lembaga ekstra di luar peradilan seperti ky itu diperlukan untuk mengawasi perilaku hakim dan jaksa konflik dengan kepentingan lama tak terhindarkan dan kita lihat keadaan ini sebagai situasi transisional menuju penegakan hukum progresif

7403767 we went through its pretty well documented on our dvd elegies when we were talking about where we were as a band there was a period where nobody wanted to really touch us we said back then when the band went through this weird dark period and when we came out of it one of the things we said was we need to get to a point where a band like metallica says we need to take that band on tour and this year that whole thing happened man its surreal
7403768 metallica does not need machine head to open up for them to bring people into the arena they are doing us the biggest favor that anybody could ever do for a band it puts you in front of an arena full of people that potentially you can win over thats amazing that speaks volumes for the dudes that they are we couldnt be more honored we couldnt be more were blown away by it

7403773 in 2000 4 000 people decided the election that is a few campus dorms on the uw madison campus that is one campus like platteville and superior it is just one campus if they didnt get any attention maybe the elction would have been decided a different way
7403774 going back to the past two elections you can make the argument that wi won because of the strong votes in madison and if you look at closer there were strong votes from the youth they played a direct role in delivering a key state and that is going to count this time
7403775 the major way to approach passive students is to let them know the importance of voting and being active and also the simplicity of it
7403776 it was a complete and total surprise i had done nothing to suggest that i was seeking the post and i got a call out of the blue not from perhaps not from someone youd expect i had a telephone call on my cellphone from senator clinton

7403790 you realize there are mice everywhere we clean all the time and get inspected it is nearing summer and what do you expect blah blah blah
7403791 well i understand that but you see how unsanitary and unpleasant it is to dine here when someone finds a deceased rodent in the dining area i am not asking for much i will gladly pay for the drinks just not the food that i barely touched because of the fact of the mouse
7403792 i have so much pride in my mouse infested restaurant
7403793 so you think you shouldnt have to pay for the entire bill then i see no its okay its a custom thing no dont pay just leave
7403794 ie 6 cant provide the same web experience that modern browsers can
7403795 continued support of ie 6 means that we cant optimize our interfaces or provide an enhanced customer experience in our apps supporting ie 6 means slower progress less progress and in some places no progress
7403796 most blog spam comes from bots that either fake or as a trojan use internet explorer 6 of infected systems
7403797 we all know that ie6 is outdated and has horrible css rendering engine however most average internet users havent realized that yet why because we put our hard work on it and patch the bugs by various ie hacks

7403800 i read a writers almanac on the internet every morning and am very grateful to be able to do so
7403801 about time i paid for listening to and reading the writers almanac besides i could do with another mug
7403802 i read the writers almanac every single day send bits of it to friends save quotes in my archives i am inspired by the struggles of people of the past and adore hearing the historical truth behind the legends of the great and the unsung it has become part of the days beginning
7403803 my husband and i enjoy reading the writers almanac daily and value what it adds to our lives
7403804 i love the writers almanac and garrison keillor although im at work and dont get to hear garrisons voice every day i receive the e mail versions so that 5 minutes is an essential part of my daily life
7403805 as a writer ive enjoyed the writers almanac as a source of inspiration and enlightenment for years
7403806 writers almanac is one the best things in my inbox
7403807 i love my daily writers almanac email i appreciate the quirky interesting literary and historical facts and the wide range of poetry presented over time i have genuinely increased my knowledge of literature
7403808 lets take it from the ground up there is still some work to be done on this
7403809 at times i think some people sought for me to make every play
7403810 i was one of 11 out there but when much is expected then those type of words and feelings come with it and youre held to a higher standard i understand that i took the accolades so at the same time i have to take the criticisms
7403811 a lot of times when a guy gets a change of scenery its a fresh start and he has something to prove to everybody ive heard the knock on him but the thing i have to go by is what i see here on the field
7403812 since hes been here with us his attitude has been good hes helping the younger players playing the defense the way we want it and hes giving good effort and i think if we are cognizant of the fact that he might not be able to play 100 plays in a game and needs a breather we can get somebody else out there so he can catch his breath then still get good production out of him
7403813 ive had a long career as far as snaps go
7403814 ive had several seasons over 1 000 snaps being in those trenches that wears on you theres nothing wrong with a rotation theres no need for me to be out there playing on a half tank when theres more than one qualified guy next to me capable of handling some of the snaps
7403815 if they want to talk about it then ill talk about it if not theres no need for me to discuss it
7403816 in a 4 3 it allowed me to be more aggressive
7403817 its a big change from playing a tilt cock nose with an attacking pass rush style to playing a zero technique with a lot more man reading and pre snap reads thats been a transition for me
7403818 theyre detroit fans and if theyre not rooting for the home team what are they doing here

7403833 we have clear evidence of organisations which used to be funded and have delivered on outcomes but have suddenly not been supported
7403834 and we have to ask the question whether there seems to be an acceptance that if another black youth is killed they are just another one that we dont have to worry about
7403835 black youths within this country have been left to die and thats a very strong statement but its a statement that seems to be borne out through evidence about black youths who seem to be at the top of the list when it comes to our youngsters being killed
7403836 now were asking very serious questions of national government and local government as to why it seems that resources that have been allocated for community cohesion and other activities have not been going to those organisations

7403910 go ahead vote for obama see what it gets you
7403911 he who makes a beast out of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man
7403912 there is light at the end for the heart that holds on and there will be an end to these troubles
7403913 traditional fijian living is a good way to live and we come here to learn
7403914 i dont want to be surrounded by death right now
7403915 some of that strength in grain prices earlier this year was for real
7403916 as we go into the fall we know for example that the price of natural gas is going to go up an average of 20 per cent
7403917 for a family that means about a 260 a year increase which when looked at in grocery terms thats two or three weeks of groceries
7403918 its going to be quite difficult in the coming months in terms of their ability to put food on the table and to have a standard of living that is necessary
7403919 the rising price of gasoline energy food as well as tough economic times theyre coming together in a gathering storm
7403920 puts a few more steps into shopping looking around seeing what is the best bargain out there thats all you can do
7403921 hopefully the gas prices will level out a bit for the coming winter because thats always a problem too you cant get around as well
7403922 ive definitely rearranged what i buy where i buy and how i buy and i cant afford to drive the way i used to
7403923 public transit can be a blessing sometimes not as convenient but you do what you have to do
7403924 were starting to see the leading edge of the storm
7403925 we do some work in first nations community sandy lake located about 700 kilometres northwest of thunder bay
7403926 gas prices are even higher there 1 70 a litre it just absolutely and ultimately reduces your mobility
7403927 given theres already high rates of poverty were extremely worried about conditions in communities in northwestern ontario
7403928 the north and rural regions certainly are finding it difficult
7403929 the people coming in that cant pay their hydro bills and their gas bills and so theyre being shut off is increasing if you cant pay that you cant get food
7403930 peanut butter and jam i dont have i dont have any canned meat on my shelf i dont have the canned pasta on my shelf because theyre 1 a can the peanut butter went from 1 60 up to 2 20
7403931 so even for providing i have to make some choices
7403932 if youre not voting for obama go home youre not voting here today
7403933 if you favor barack obama youre a welcome guest here we just disagree with you
7403934 hillary was the one who fueled obama gaining he only gained as the anti hillary candidate the last gasp of dean et al she is doing the smartest thing she can removing the radioactive crap so she can run again in 2012
7403935 helped me cope better with stressful situations given me lots more energy and im breathing better

7403939 barack obama has chosen senator joe biden to be our vice presidential nominee
7403940 the whole idea of a roll call vote could be in flux at this point
7403941 the clinton people here theyve said they wanted catharsis they wanted that roll call but they may not get it
7403942 they dont want to be blamed for any trouble at this convention
7403943 that way youre not impeding efficiency and youre achieving equity on the back end
7403944 you fraud were too chicken to pick the strongest person for vp why b c she told the truth and you fraud were too chicken to accept it
7403945 ok they are now reporting that hillary will release her delegates on wednesday morning
7403946 im still tooling around with my speech a little bit it may not be as good as the other headliners the first three nights but hopefully it will make clear the choice the american people are going to make in november
7403947 i am puma hear me roar in numbers too big to ignore

7403954 you have shown us the unifying power of sport the olympic spirit lives in the warm embrace of competitors from nations in conflict keep that spirit alive when you return home
7403955 o que es t rolando na cena musical no rj
7403956 hai orang orang yang beriman bertaubatlah kepada allah dengan taubat yang semurni murninya mudah mudahan rabb kamu akan menghapuskan kesalahan kesalahanmu dan memasukkan kamu ke dalam surga yang mengalir di bawahnya sungai sungai
7403957 setiap keturunan adam itu banyak melakukan dosa dan sebaik baik orang yang berdosa adalah bertaubat
7403958 barangsiapa yang tidak meninggalkan kata kata dusta dan perbuatannya maka niscaya allah tidak akan membutuhkan bentuk puasanya dari makanan dan minuman
7403959 seandainya kamu berpuasa maka hendaklah pendengaranmu penglihatanmu dan lisanmu turut berpuasa dari dusta dan hal hal haram dan janganlah kamu menyakiti tetangga bersikap tenang dan berwibawalah di hari puasamu janganlah kamu jadikan hari puasamu dan hari tidak berpuasamau sama
7403960 inilah ketakwaan yang sejati adapun mencampuradukkan antara ketaatan dan kemaksiatan maka ini tidak masuk dalam bingkai taqwa meski dibarengi dengan amalan amalan sunnah
7403961 kewajiban orang yang berpuasa adalah menahan diri dari hal hal mubah dan hal hal terlarang mengekang diri dari makanan minuman dan jima ini sebenarnya hanya sekedar menahan diri dari hal hal mubah yang diperbolehkan sementara itu ada hal hal terlarang yang tidak boleh kita langgar baik di bulan ramadhan maupun di bulan lainnya di bulan suci ini tentunya larangan tersebut menjadi lebih tegas maka sungguh sangat mengherankan kondisi orang yang berpuasa menahan diri dari hal hal yang pada dasarnya dibolehkan seperti makan dan minum kemudian dia tidak berpuasa dan tidak berpaling dari perbuatan perbuatan yang diharamkan di sepanjang jaman seperti perbuatan ghibah mengadu domba mencaci mencela mengumpat dan lain lain semua ini merontokkan pahala puasa
7403962 barangsiapa yang shalat karena allah selama empat puluh hari dengan berjamaah dan sellau mendapatkan takbiratul ihram imam maka akan dituliskan begainya dua jaminan surat kebebasan bebas dari apni neraka dan dari nifaq
7403963 sesungguhnya allah tidak menjadikan batas akhir bagi amal seorang mukmin melainkan ajalnya
7403964 rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam merupakan orang yang paling dermawan dan beliau lebih dermawan sekali di bulan ramadhan
7403965 alangkah buruknya tingkah mereka mereka tidak mengenal allah melainkan hanya di bulan ramadhan
7403966 merupakan ciri utama diterimanya puasa kita di bulan ramadhan dan tanda terbesar adalah keberhasilan kita meraih lailatul qadar adalah berubahnya diri kita menjadi lebih baik daripada kondisi kita sebelum ramadhan
7403967 tamu agung itu beberapa hari lagi akan tiba sudah siapkah kita untuk menyambutnya bisa jadi inilah ramadhan terakhir kita sebelum menghadap kepada yang maha kuasa betapa banyak orang orang yang pada tahun kemaren masih berpuasa bersama kita bertarawih dan beridul fitri di samping kita namun ternyata sudah mendahului kita dan sekarang mereka telah berbaring di peristirahatan umum ditemani hewan hewan tanah kapankah datang giliran kita shallallahu alaihi wa sallam menggambarkan kondisi dua golongan yang saling bertolak belakang kondisi mereka dalam berpuasa dan melewati bulan ramadhan golongan pertama digambarkan nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam barangsiapa yang berpuasa ramadhan dengan penuh keimanan dan mengharap pahala maka dosanya yang telah lalu akan diampuni
7403968 betapa banyak orang berpuasa yang hanya merasakan lapar dan dahaga saja
7403969 dalam menyambut kedatangan musim musim ibadah seorang hamba sangat membutuhkan bimbingan bantuan dan taufiq allah taala cara meraih semua itu adalah dengan bertawakkal kepada nya
7403970 padahal mereka tidaklah diperintahkan melainkan supaya beribadah kepada allah dengan mengikhlaskan ketaatan kepada nya
7403971 barangsiapa yang mengamalkan suatu amalan yang tidak ada dari kami maka amalan itu akan tertolak
7403972 karena engkau telah menghukum saya tersesat saya benar benar akan menghalang halangi mereka para manusia dari jalan mu yang lurus kemudian saya akan mendatangi mereka dari muka dan dari belakang mereka dan kanan dan kiri mereka
7403973 solt de wind wer leven droagen ik huiverde dit is toch te gek ik begin me van alles in mijn hoofd te halen ik trilde over mijn hele lijf ik moet me beheersen op dat moment begint mijn vrouw te kreunen en ik ben net op tijd om haar op ik houd haar in mijn armen en kijk bij toeval over haar schouder naar buiten op het maanovergoten grasveld staat kaarsrecht een rijzige figuur de blik op mijn slaapkamerraam gericht op mijn blote voeten draaf ik de trap af en ren naar buiten de tuin in geschrokken herinner ik me de oerwortel en ren naar het schuurtje die man zou toch niet opgelucht zie ik de deken nog liggen en een stukje wortel steekt eruit een vreemde gloed straalt door de deken heen een soort schimmig groen het ene moment fel en daarna verflauwd het weer wat is er toch met deze wortel welke misschien welke duistere krachten verbergt het heeft het voor het water gezorgd en voor die vreemde enge man ik pieker me suf om meer dingen te herinneren uit de legende is de man in het boorje dan de droese dalm die voor zoveel ellende heeft gezorgd en het dorpje en de vrouwen heeft doen verdwijnen het zweet breekt mij uit want als het zo is wat gebeurt er dan met ons dorp ik heb het gevoel dat er onheil naderd dan verstijf ik mijn vrouw ik heb haar zomaar alleen achtergelaten in onze slaapkamer op een holletje ren ik weer terug het huis in naar boven waar mijn vrouw net een beetje probeert overeind te komen haar blik is verward en ze kijkt me doordringend aan het schiet door me heen dat zij me nog steeds niet verteld waar ze die middag nu naar toe is gegaan haar stem klinkt hees en schokkerig je kan zien dat ze inwendig een strijd voert haar pupillen gaan onrustig heen en weer dan blijft haar blik ineens strak op mij gericht en er verschijnen kleine zweetpareltjes op haar voorhoofd ze probeert me iets duidelijk te maken maar het lijkt of iets in haar dat tegenwerkt de blik in haar ogen wisselt permanent tussen angst paniek en verbijstering ze sluit even haar ogen maar opend ze direct weer en zegt moeizaam met trillende kaken
7403974 wees niet bevreesd wij hebben geen kwaad in de zin
7403975 wij begrijpen dit neem wat tijd om dit te verwerken strijder zegt ze
7403976 je gedachten zijn voor ons niet verborgen alles is ons bekend van de oerwortel en jou rosalinneke
7403977 je hoeft ons niets uit te leggen we weten waarvoor je komt ook dat je betrokken bent bij de zaak van je vrouw die als enigste en laatste weefster de fouten en gruwelen van het verleden kan herstellen
7403978 jouw vrouw roos is de laatste rechtstreekse nakomeling van ons ras
7403979 luister strijder ga terug naar jouw tijd en ga met de oerwortel het meer op de kolk zal je brengen waar je moet zijn vind roos en geef haar de wortel zij kan het kwaad met wortel en al uitroeien
7403980 laat je gaan geef je over en je zult gered worden zijn valse tronie toonde zich zeker van de overwinning en zijn akelige lach veranderde in een nachtmerrie achtige glimlach van deze vijand kon ik het niet winnen en ik zag mijn leven in flarden voorbijflitsen in mijn geest mijn krachten namen snel af en ik wist dat ik niet lang meer weerstand zou kunnen bieden aan deze woeste waterhel het was zover de kolkende watermassa sloot zich boven mij en in mijn geest doemde weer de triomfantelijke kop op van duusterman hij wilde net weer wat zeggen toen zijn beeld veranderde in het gezicht van roos ze keek bezorgd natuurlijk weer zon smerige streek van duusterman natuurlijk
7403981 ik moet u de groeten over brengen van uw rosalineke strijder
7403982 uw vrouw rosa ontwikkelt haar krachten door al deze gebeurtenissen nu snel ze weet en beseft nu wat haar roeping is ze is nog steeds in de de macht van de duistere krachten maar duusterman beseft niet dat dat zijn ondergang zal worden in de geest hebben wij nu contact met haar zonder dat duusterman dit weet wat er ontbreekt is slechts de oerwortel het enigste middel om de macht van het duister te breken
7403983 ga naar huis kijk op zolder daar liggen resten van de stof die roos heeft geweven maak
7403984 strijder wij groeten u en dat de kracht van de oerwortel met u mogen zijn
7403985 gij hoeft oe eige over de boat nie druk te moaken
7403986 ik wist dat je zou komen ik heb geen moment getwijfeld
7403987 maar wat is dit hier waar zijn we en hoe kom jij hier wat is er met je gebeurd
7403988 ja jij dacht dat het verdwenen was of verwoest roos glimlacht om mijn verbaasde gezicht dan vervolgd ze
7403989 o nee dat is natuurlijk het werk van duusterman amp co
7403990 ja kom mee dat is mijn bootje onderweg vertel ik hoe ik
7403991 het was alleen maar een krampje geloof ik alleen verwachtte ik hem niet dus schrok ik ervan
7403992 ons meissie wordt hier geboren dus voorlopig hoeven we ons nog niet druk te maken over de weg terug
7403993 lieverd mijn zussen zijn prima in staat mij te helpen bij de bevalling van ons meissie
7403994 zusterssssssssssze gilde met een volume waar ik nu nog geen naam voor heb
7403995 kom maar het dorpshuis in dan maak ik wat te eten en te drinken voor je en leg ik wat zaken uit over ons dorp de zusters en niet te vergeten over jou
7403996 waarom kunt u dan wel in mijn omgeving zijn zonder zwanger te worden
7403997 mijn vruchtbare jaren zijn voorbij jongen ik ben nu een wijze oude vrouw en kan geen kinderen meer krijgen mijn taak nu is om alles wat ik weet door te geven aan al de andere zusters ze te helpen bij beslissingen en ze met hulp en raad bij te staan bij de situaties waar ze in terecht komen
7403998 ach weet je eigenlijk zijn wij dabben een grote familie een familie van vrouwen en al lijkt het vreemd jij als enigste man voelt toch aan als
7403999 zoals je begrepen hebt vervolgde mynthia heeft tijd voor de dabben niet zoveel betekenis
7404000 maar we zijn er nog niet deze plaats is niet te betreden door duusterman
7404001 ik zal het je uitleggen de witte kracht is een ontlading van positieve energie die ontstaat alleen op het
7404002 begrijp je nu waarom duusterman je vrouw liet ontvoeren hij maakte zich grote zorgen toen hij ontdekte dat een nog een dabbenvrouw was op de bovenwereld en dan nog wel een die gerustgesteld
7404003 luister op het moment van de geboorte ontstaat er een magische energiegolf die wij met zn allen kunnen
7404004 je kan het je zult gemotiveerd zijn beseft wel dat de kans op een toekomst ja zelfs het leven van je dochter
7404005 neem even de tijd om bij te komen jullie en zeker roos gaan het nog zwaar krijgen de komende periode
7404006 ach meissie toch laat papa niet zo schrikken hij is niet gewend aan stemmen in zijn hoofd
7404007 ze kon het waarschijnlijk niet laten je even te plagen zo meteen moet ze zich bezig houden met haar geboorte en daarna is het een gewone baby die alles moet leren
7404008 het komt allemaal goed papa straks als ik groot ben weef ik een andere haarband voor je want je loopt wel een beetje voor gek met de oerwortel zo op je voorhoofd gebonden
7404009 het is goed meid ga jij je nu maar concentreren op geboren worden
7404010 frits is degene die jou dit avontuur heeft laten meemaken hij heeft het verhaal gestart en mag jullie nu weer gezond naar jullie eigen wereld brengen
7404011 ik bleef na het overlijden van bettie contact met de groep houden
7404012 door gaten in de tijd komen duistere krachten vrij die kwaad brengen
7404013 hoe weet u wat de oude antwoordde voor ik uitgesproken was
7404014 o het is goed te weten en er is geen weet bij uwes zie ik mm scherp uw gehoor
7404015 uwes moet begrijpen zei hij mij taxerend dat er in de weeromtiid ver om ver om van kwaad tot erger van doen was mm ja ja u bedoelt de
7404016 wat kin dat wiifke dr wat van nou t is geliik n mirakel
7404017 zo gunne de zaken die er toe doen in t werom das noait best
7404018 wat moat en wilde gij hier bie mien huske zijt gij een schelm dieventuig
7404019 he he kan het wat minder riep ik geschrokken maar ook kwaad uit en wie ben jij dan wel eucalipta
7404020 ja en waarheen ik weet niet eens waar ik ben
7404021 u laat me schrikken door hier zo plotseling te verschijnen
7404022 maar wie bent u eigenlijk wat is uw rol hij kijkt mij verrast aan
7404023 ik ben als tijdgeest node bekend met de veranderingen die de tijd van dan voegt naar de tijd van nu
7404024 wel zo moogt gij het duiden maar dit zal moeten geschiedde naar natuurlijk patroon
7404025 en dat heeft te maken met de gebeurtenissen in dabbelo
7404026 en de tijd dringt ik knikte en begreep dat hier misschien het begin lag van de oplossing ik vertelde van het heksenhuisje en de krater op de zandvlakte
7404027 gij moet weerom thans zijt gij en uw vrouwke eerste betrokkene bij het gebeuren
7404028 hij sprak plots ongewoon heftig hij staarde mij aan en ik zag zijn ogen blauw oplichten zoals bij mijn vrouw was gebeurd
7404029 gegroet vreemdeling uit verre tiiden dat gij mijne oetval van weleer kan vergeven
7404030 mag ik oe vragen tezamen met mijne kind het noenmaal te nuttigen
7404031 hoelang gaat dit duren en hoe is dit voor mijn vrouw haar gezondheid
7404032 doat wiet alleen de kalde macht ut alde doagen ik vond het een beangstigende tekst dat ene zinnetje gaf mij een onzeker gevoel wat betreft de mogelijkheid van een weerzien met haar het maakte eveneens tedere gevoelens in mij los ik slikte naar mijn idee iets te luidruchtig iets weg als in een visioen zag haar even voor me zoals ik haar het liefst zag met haar lange haar prachtig golvend los over haar schouders het hoofd in de nek en schaterlachend het maakte me even week ik voelde dat mijn ogen vochtig waren mijn arme rosalinneke zoals ik roos graag noemde ik voelde een hand op mijn schouder de oude vrouw keek me vriendelijk aan ze had een warme en begrijpende blik in dat oude doorploegde gelaat neem toch plaats heerschap zei ze zacht ze wees naar iets wat je met wat fantasie een fauteuil zou kunnen noemen ik ging zitten en begreep dat ze me iets wilde vertellen ze ging op een krukje tegenover me zitten en keek me aan ze legde haar beide tanige handen op de mijne en zei
7404033 ja sprak de oude zo stond het al sinds jaar ende tijd geschreven dat de gruwel van de duusterman zou zijn geschied zij alleen kon de duustere pijn genezen
7404034 maar de droeze dalm is de man in het bootje die mijn vrouw meenam op het meer
7404035 is mijn vrouw nu hier in uh uw tijd ik bedoel hier in deze omgeving
7404036 ja zeker en wel als zij gevat is door de duusterman is zij op een worp van de steen van hier
7404037 weet sprak zij verder dat zijn verblijf is onder de grond op ene plaats waar hij heer en de meester is
7404038 pas op heerschap met de heer van het kwaad ende gruwel valt niet te spotten
7404039 the use of this image is in extremely poor taste and it should not have been used to promote london
7404040 will you pledge that by january 2013 the end of your first term more than five years from now there will be no u s troops in iraq
7404041 its hard to project four years from now and i think it would be irresponsible we dont know what contingency will be out there
7404042 i agree with barack it is very difficult to know what were going to be inheriting you know we do not know walking into the white house in january 2009 what were going to find
7404043 would you pledge to the american people that iran will not develop a nuclear bomb while you are president
7404044 i intend to do everything i can to prevent iran from developing a nuclear bomb
7404045 would you pledge to the american people that iran would not build a nuclear bomb on your watch
7404046 well senator i want to ask you this because in 2004 when you ran for president you said we could not afford universal health care it was not achievable and it was not responsible youve changed dramatically on this issue
7404047 if israel concluded that irans nuclear capability threatened israels security would israel be justified in launching an attack on iran
7404048 governor if kitty dukakis were raped and murdered would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer
7404049 were going to take a break and come back with our lightning round 30 seconds to answer each question
7404050 he is thin skinned about having his motives and competence questioned so thats what you do
7404051 with a faith they could be practical pragmatic worldly that with these attributes they could manage what came over historys transom i see obama as like this things will come over the transom and hell approach them as a thoughtful sophisticate hell think
7404052 these rules send a clear signal that the administration will spend the rest of its days razing what remains of the rules and regulations that have kept wildlife like the bald eagle from going extinct
7404053 this means any time there is a new federal construction project well nepa the national environmental policy act will be waived and therell be no environmental review
7404054 as i acquired them i grew to appreciate vans work more and more
7404055 one of the things most courtrooms need is a splash of color and a sense of proportion most courtrooms are pretty drab
7404056 we should not be intimidated by the courthouse but neither should we enter it as casually as we would enter a store or restaurant
7404057 in a windowless courtroom good art adds a necessary degree of spice
7404058 my father spent a lot of time in courtrooms and now my art hangs in one
7404059 we are the custodian for the public and we need to offer an environment where people feel comfortable
7404060 i think its wonderful more inviting to lawyers and to parties
7404061 it feels better than looking at pictures of old judges or maps of texas
7404062 the courthouse is the face of government and for many people it is where theyll have their most important interaction with government
7404063 i meant this to be something that doesnt look government issue
7404064 i havent tried to run away from my endorsement of him
7404065 i want to say something about me and what i am running for congress for
7404066 i am proud to be in the position i am
7404067 because i think that being in the majority party and being in the party that has probably caused some of your interests more grief than the other party helps the cause we are on the inside of leadership and can try to make sure some of these bills never come to the floor
7404068 the way i am going to make my difference is by being able to call those folks up and make sure that they listen to the needs of this district
7404069 folks in our area realize lampson isnt being completely honest with them because he refuses to address his past support for tax increases on families budget busting spending weak immigration policies opposition to american energy independence and his supporting role for the obama biden campaign
7404070 we told him that if he went to bed with them they wouldnt respect him in the morning
7404071 but nick lampson thinks hes cute enough to turn their heads hes not
7404072 the real winners are this regions commuters who will benefit sooner rather than later from improved mobility
7404073 so we can know the answer before we start digging dirt and spending taxpayer dollars
7404074 he raised hundreds and hundreds of thousands for hillary in the primary
7404075 i promoted hillary because she knows us she understands us
7404076 i got not one cent from her and ill get as much from obama
7404077 will latinos cast a vote for mccain because they cant bring themselves to vote for a black man
7404078 yes some will and others may stay home and others may hold their nose and vote the democratic ticket
7404079 people are not going to stay home and the traditional gop effort to tamp down voting by the elderly by minorities and by the working class all strong democratic voters wont play
7404080 there was this trend where the amount of homework was equated with how rigorous your program was
7404081 what youre seeing in spring branch and in other places is a backlash to that
7404082 im not a believer in sending home 25 algebra questions as homework when five would let the teacher know if the student gets it
7404083 homework to be useful has to be graded and has to have prompt feedback it cant be done for completion only
7404084 it would be really nice to have some family time in the evenings to unwind to talk about your day
7404085 that doesnt mean that young children shouldnt be doing some homework
7404086 but the assignments should be short lead to success involve parents and demonstrate to kids that the things they are learning in school have applications to things they enjoy doing at home
7404087 anything that goes home for homework cannot be new material
7404088 it has to be something they have done before in class theres just not enough time in the day with all of the things we have to do to practice
7404089 students certainly are going to be expected to get things done on their own so thats an important skill
7404090 its kinda hard but thats my job to do it
7404091 asking children to work more doesnt have to be a boring horrible way to pass time
7404092 its possible to find ways for learning to be interesting and fun so the kids actually look forward to doing work
7404093 im a little excited and disappointed that the summer is over
7404094 i feel excited to see my friends but im not excited to be doing schoolwork
7404095 i just wish the summer would last a little longer
7404096 because summer is fun and i get to go a lot of places
7404097 but im excited because im going to meet new people
7404098 i grabbed my dog and went into the hallway and yelled help
7404099 she recalled within minutes her plea was answered by her neighbor tc lenormand who carried her down the stairs to the lobby
7404100 i was so afraid he was going to hurt himself
7404101 its important to raise peoples awareness they need to think about what they would do to evacuate way ahead of time they should practice with friends and family
7404102 find themselves in a situation where they have to roll themselves down the steps
7404103 i always evaluate the facility and determine how im going to get out of my room
7404104 there was a fire alarm and i was evacuating and i found a woman yelling for help
7404105 i carried her down thats the long and short of it
7404106 they would give you all the blurb all the copy then you would have to illustrate it panel to panel and you had a certain amount of poetic license
7404107 i had this drive to try to do the best i could one time i picked up a script one editor said one thing about you sitton i know youre going to fill the page that was a compliment
7404108 the style the artwork was a lot more clean and crisp
7404109 even without reading a lot of words it told a story in and of itself
7404110 he was very surprised i was able to find all that stuff
7404111 i think what they did was important this is part of americana
7404112 so many things happened to me in terms of racism from teachers principals and other students
7404113 i decided im not going to subject my kids to that
7404114 ten years ago there were not that many people of color home schooling
7404115 almost everybody knows in public schools blacks are at the bottom of the totem pole
7404116 i said no way am i going to allow you to do this type of damage to my child
7404117 i yanked him out and didnt know what i was going to do
7404118 theyve gotten a chance to see real life and make application with learning and weve been able to forge our belief system
7404119 we havent missed it you learn to tighten your belt
7404120 we were appalled and very disappointed in ourselves for putting him that environment
7404121 the teacher was sweet as she can be but there were a handful of kids totally disrupting the class we couldnt see how anybody could learn in that environment
7404122 my kids i want them to be well rounded and we have that choice when we choose their curriculum
7404123 you dont want me you want the office of the president and that doesnt belong to me it belongs to the american people and its not for sale
7404124 i dont consider that i have done anything which should be the reason for any award congressional or otherwise
7404125 my choice early in life was either to be a piano player in a whorehouse or a politician and to tell the truth theres hardly any difference i for one believe the piano player job to be much more honorable than current politicians
7404126 you dont want me you want the office of the president and that doesnt belong to me it belongs to the american people and its not for sale
7404127 my choice early in life was either to be a piano player in a whorehouse or a politician and to tell the truth theres hardly any difference
7404128 i for one believe the piano player job to be much more honorable than current politicians
7404129 when im in council session i tell everyone to watch
7404130 i may need to pick up the phone and say did you get that
7404131 we got the flat screens that dont take up as much room
7404132 i think those big old tvs are a safety hazard
7404133 i just wanted to spend my personal money for that not taxpayer money
7404134 sometimes i have to close the door because of the tv noise
7404135 it leaves the wrong impression that you dont have anything better to do than watch tv
7404136 i cannot see paying taxpayer dollars without getting them something in return thats why i like to give most of my surplus money to parks
7404137 being a newly elected official i wanted to make sure we knew each others personalities and how to deal effectively with the public
7404138 as an at large council person its really a challenge to get to all parts of the city
7404139 you can show up at a meeting and people might not know you
7404140 we needed some more storage space so we got some units that had shelving and storage built in
7404141 its very functional its not anything thats extra or over the top
7404142 i could have bought all new furniture but i didnt
7404143 i just took the chairs and had them re upholstered
7404144 i got to be here for six years i wanted it to match if you didnt notice i like to match
7404145 the reception is an opportunity for sen clinton to see her delegates many for the first time since the primaries ended thank them for their hard work and support and most importantly to encourage them to support and work for sen obama as strongly as she has in order to elect him in november
7404146 in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests
7404147 this campaign is not about barack obama and hillary clinton
7404148 his campaign is about george bush and four more years of george bush under john mccain
7404149 that message is going to echo clearly from this platform
7404150 sort of like us he obama comes from a middle class background he went to school on scholarships he had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about child care
7404151 the republican track record on national security has not been particularly good
7404152 my job in this campaign is to explain that talking tough and acting dumb is not a way to keep you safe and secure
7404153 we need somebody who talks tough whos going to act smart and be tough thats how were going to look after the safety of the american people
7404154 i dont think hes ready to be president and when youre commander in chief you shouldnt be having to select a mentor to help you with that role
7404155 we have a great track record of bringing substance with splash
7404156 you expect people to respond by organizing a protest and throwing their fists in the air and you also expect people to respond by flying 1 000 american flags
7404157 and those are two legitimate ways to respond to politics but there is a whole in between area that doesnt get talked about
7404158 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7404159 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain
7404160 the number of clinton democrats who say they would vote for mccain has gone up 11 points since june enough to account for most although not all of the support mccain has gained in that time
7404161 its not that theres anything wrong with the choice of joe biden a majority rate the biden selection as excellent or pretty good voters think he is qualified to be president and with the exception of al gore in 1992 the public ranks biden as the most qualified running mate in recent times
7404162 a lot of americans dont know who he is but his favorable rating is 13 points higher than his unfavorables but biden is not hillary clinton and its possible that is enough to have moved some of her supporters away from the democratic ticket at least temporarily

7404213 this sunday will be an emotional and important game for essendon as we farewell four players who in their own way have each had a big impact on the club and its supporters
7404214 i call on all essendon fans to get to sundays game and say thanks to these four players they deserve to be recognised for their hard work and commitment to the bombers
7404215 he is a champion of this club both as a person and as a player and he leaves a lasting legacy with his premiership and work to help establish the annual call to arms campaign and clash for cancer game
7404216 rama is a courageous person and is incredibly well thought of by the playing group coaches and staff i hope he continues to be involved with the club in the future
7404217 jason has had to overcome a number of injury set backs this year but he has just kept persevering and has come back into the senior side which shows his character
7404218 he has been a great warrior of the essendon football club and had an excellent career i see him as a leader and we have been fortunate to have him at this club

7404245 wolf blitzer on the situation room begging viewers to stay tuned so cnn can bring them coverage of a text message
7404246 was very effective in achieving its primary goal which was to build up obamas already massive database of supporters and develop yet another way they can be reached and mobilized during the final run up to the election
7404247 they can start to mash all the data they have collected from multiple places such as their e mail list their contributors their donors and now these cell phone numbers with voter files and give themselves the potential to identify key activists who might volunteer to make calls canvas or help with gotv get out the vote
7404248 this info will also help them identify people who are still making up their minds or havent fully committed and the campaign can redouble its efforts to make the final sale
7404249 i dont think folks expected that barack himself keyed in the message on his blackberry and sent it out
7404250 but signing up for the alert and then getting the word directly to your own mobile is a lot more personal than seeing it in a newspaper some kid threw up on your front porch beside many of the younger text generation dont read newspapers anyway
7404251 obamas use of the new tools is not like a single silver bullet that has one big impact
7404252 instead what they are doing is using the new media to reach a whole new generation the way they want to communicate over and over again every time the obama campaign touches these folks in the new media and they respond back its another strand of connectedness that eventually forms a strong web of connectedness and activism and that is very powerful
7404253 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7404254 we have seen some text campaigns in the many hundreds of thousands of opt in mobile users over the past couple years all in the consumer products services realm

7404330 i am not telling you how to vote but if the democrats win this bill will pass and you wont have a vote on whether you want a union

7404336 america is fill in the blank racist and not ready for a black man to be president stupid not willing to vote in its own self interests gullible to republican pr chicanery
7404337 the fallacy of the headline is that there is a direct competition between the two that its either or the reality is that strong global economic growth has changed the demand equation for u s commodities
7404338 farmers profitability doesnt change retail prices and farmers profitability isnt guaranteed by high grain prices the same factors that are lifting grain prices are lifting production costs
7404339 so yes the farm price index is at 162 percent of what it was 1990 1992 but at the same time the price index measuring what farmers pay for services farm wages is 189 percent of base

7404349 if the only way you can accept an assertion is by faith then you are conceding that it cant be taken on its own merits
7404350 my atheism like that of spinoza is true piety towards the universe and denies only gods fashioned by men in their own image to be servants of their human interests
7404351 i help others not because i dont want to go to hell because my higher power wants me to be of service to others
7404352 the most closed minded pig headed ignorant people i know on the other hand are atheists
7404353 people of faith give more to charity than people without faith

7404387 on my view james and dewey were not only waiting at the end of the dialectical road which analytic philosophy traveled but are waiting at the end of the road which for example foucault and deleuze are currently traveling

7404396 oh no what does this mean now shes hearing things
7404397 with all the things they have to deal with a job mortgages and kids education unless they have an accounting background there s no way for them to understand the process
7404398 we don t set our budget and have hearings until about mid september statutorily we re obligated to operate in july august and september based on spending no more than what we ve spent the previous year
7404399 we have a number of elected officials and appointed department heads around the first of july the finance committee meets with them and gives them their budget documents and we give them perimeters
7404400 the departments put together their requests and that comes back to us
7404401 we as a finance committee look at them and where the revenues are and start formulating the whole budget process
7404402 we have a very good group of people i ve noticed at the end of the fiscal year the number who have money left in the budget unspent and that s a real credit to them
7404403 we ve been very fortunate at the county level we ve been able to maintain a quality roads system
7404404 if someone was cut out of the budget they could go before the council the council can adjust up or down
7404405 they re very prudent in the way they spend their money
7404406 it s the people you put in public office that drives this community
7404407 with all the things they have to deal with a job mortgages and kids education unless they have an accounting background there s no way for them to understand the process
7404408 i ve noticed at the end of the fiscal year the number who have money left in the budget unspent and that s a real credit to them
7404409 we ve talked with staff to see what their visions for the department are
7404410 we ve surveyed the kids to see what they want we look at what facilities we have and don t have what programs we have and don t have
7404411 it s the people you put in public office that drives this community
7404412 we ve been working on trying to develop a training site
7404413 the first phase is what we re working on now
7404414 when we re running the volume of responses we re running it s critical to have a place to train
7404415 when the deputies first get out of basic training they wouldn t be able to keep up proficiency without additional training
7404416 keeping the deputies trained in the long run is a cost saver
7404417 we try to take advantage of as much free training as possible but you still have to pay the deputy
7404418 the city administrator expects the department head to accurately inform him of what it costs to equip personnel with what they need to perform their tasks for the year
7404419 only organizations that operate 24 hours a day weekends and holidays can know what it s like to set a budget like this
7404420 everything is looked at by what we will most likely be expected to do
7404421 you look at what the priorities are that the public will call the police for
7404422 then you have to look at specialized units like investigations they have a lot of different needs than the uniform division and they have a lot of specialized equipment not used in the uniform division
7404423 we try to maintain all of these specialized units because we believe they are important to the police department
7404424 we ve carried over funds for the pumper it s an item that you can t do in one budget year when we buy a 300 000 fire truck we want to use it for 20 years
7404425 this year i based it on what we were using per month and figured it at 4 per gallon
7404426 the deputies try to cut down on mileage as much as possible but we don t want to cut down on patrol or call response
7404427 we always have to budget for ongoing maintenance and repairs
7404428 every year we have to budget thousands of dollars to maintain our computer systems
7404429 wwdmagic is one of the biggest and best for west coast and international exposure exhibiting is kind of a no brainer
7404430 we expect to interact with a lot of potential buyers and really get some market spread
7404431 we believe that consumers are taking advantage of the service for their car payments not only because of the credit card rewards they earn but also the added convenience of being able to set up monthly payments not to mention a useful cash management tool

7404452 after all so many of them were in jail for things they actually had nothing to do with many were convicted by signing false statements under torture or under the flimsiest of evidence and were locked away for years
7404453 prisoners cant get jobs because of their convictions or even insurance or loans in some cases they cant get into countries like the us canada or australia so if they can wipe their record clean by proving that the convictions against them were unjust and flawed why not

7404458 translated to guantanamo the trial would go like this we say you are guilty of being an enemy combatant but wont tell you why or what evidence we have
7404459 i dont want him going but i tell you what i dont want my grandsons or granddaughters going back in 15 years so how we leave makes a big difference

7404463 do you agree or disagree with the statement made by former attorney general gonzales in january 2007 that nothing in the constitution confers an affirmative right to habeas corpus separate from any statutory habeas rights congress might grant or take away
7404464 i disagree categorically with mr gonzales the constitution guarantees the right of habeas corpus unless in the case of rebellion or invasion it is suspended my national security with justice act reinforces this constitutional right by extending by statute meaningful habeas review for all guant namo detainees

7404479 recevoir le leader devrait encore plus les motiver pour les faire tomber
7404480 cest clair quil faudrait les 3 points mais a le fera pas jimagine une d faite par un but d cart
7404481 but du cul ou de la bite on sen fout
7404482 nan nan faire le dos rond un bon 0 1 serait bien a contentera tous les nostalgiques des saisons de merde
7404483 putain 4 minutes et d j un but dans la musette
7404484 enorme erreur de de la nouvelle recrue borne juste avant le but apparement
7404485 elana fait certes une erreur sur les images de la vid o on va pas lui en vouloir il nous garantit lui seul entre 10 et 15 points par saison par contre la pelouse tait tr s humide au coup denvoi et a tr s certainement contribu l chec delana dans son intervention dune part cette pelouse a t arros e trop tardivement et dautre part la m t o ne le justifiait pas
7404486 ok avec toi pour elana on ne peut lui en vouloir par rapport aux points quil nous rapporte mais je ten pris ne parle pas dexcuses du style

7404488 shereni nous pourrit bien la vie chaque match en effet ducrocq pas mal aussi surtout que ce n est pas un lat ral
7404489 clair shereni il est impressionnant le joueur parfait pour monter puissant et solide
7404490 jai vu un beau match enfin surtout la deuxi me p riode menfin strasbourg a une grosse d fense et un excellent gardien bravo eux en jouant comme en deuxi me on gagnera cest certain tous les clubs nont pas le niveau de strasbourg
7404491 a sent la sapin nous serons plus pr s du national que de la ligue 1 cette saison
7404492 et ben voil on la notre cher championnat m diocre que lon affectionne tant et cette fois ci on est dans les temps
7404493 une d faite la maison je vais me finir dans la gnole pour oublier
7404494 derri re c est trop f brile et on sent quau moindre coup de vent on peut se faire enrhumer elana est tr s classieux sur certains gestes mais tr s f brile aussi sur certaines balles dommage on dirait qu ils se contaminent se chier dessus ou cause des consignes prudentes
7404495 je lis les commentaires sur allez brest sur le repositionnement de leroy gauche et je me dis que oui a brest nous avons dabord un probleme dentraineur

7404497 faut pas d conner quand m me domenec a t en finale de la wc bien quil soit la derni re des burnes janin cest le domenec de la l2 il est nul cest tout
7404498 seule satisfaction de ce match le limogeage de guegan au bout de 25 minutes larbitre a t bien gentil de ne pas lui coller un rouge jesp re quon ne le verra plus
7404499 bravo jannin pour avoir sorti gu gan on partait pour finir comme reims
7404500 catastrophe ce mec il se dribble tout seul en se faisant un sombr ro avec des sabots la place des pieds sur un contr le au bout d un moment faudra comprendre quavec un bourrin a peut aller mais 2 3 et le niveau de l quipe tire en bas d ailleurs moi qui critique janin souvent bravo lui d avoir sorti un gu gan aux fraises et qui allait droit aux rouges entre les coups de coude et les ballons perdus
7404501 sinon strasbourg a ne casse pas 3 pattes un canard ce qui rajoute encore plus la frustration de navoir pas au minimum arrach un nul
7404502 lequipe meritait quand meme le nul vu la deuxieme mi temps faudra esperer quil garde confiance en eux car cela peut vite tourner au vinaigre sans un grand cassard brest en mettait un ou 2
7404503 si on oublie la 1ere mi temps strasbourg ne conserve son score que par la chance maladresse brestoise et talent de cassard cette quipe na absolument rien dexceptionnel ils pouvaient rentrer avec un 3 1 contre eux en alsace leur d fense est tr s faible d s que brest a su jouer lat ralement
7404504 la meilleure deuxi me mi temps depuis le d but de saison mais face des grosses cylindr es de type strasbourg il faut aligner deux p riodes du m me acabit pour esp rer quelque chose mais avec la m me envie pendant 90 minutes plus de r ussite et un gardien autre que cassard a peut marcher a confirmer donc mais en attendant encore des points b tement l ch s domicile
7404505 premi re mi temps de merde disons les choses comme elles sont nous prenons un but au bout de 5 min de jeu et malgr s cela n ant total pas de r volte une quipe totalement amorphe qui ne semble pas vouloir revenir au score seconde p riode totalement diff rente la rentr e dyvan et le repositionnement de ferradj y tant certainement pour quelque chose mais il ne faut non plus oublier que strasbourg sest cantonn dans un r le attentiste afin de pr server ce but davance jai tout de m me la mauvaise impression que nous aurions encore pu jouer 90 min sans marquer le moindre but
7404506 brest a fait 20 excellentes minutes en 2nde mi temps mais cassard tait tr s chaud et ils ont en plus tr s bien d fendu ducroq shereni si brest pouvait jouer 60 minutes au niveau du d but de 2nde p riode c est le haut de tableau vis sur le d but de match c est le maintien a fait mal au cul de perdre mais vu le d but digne du national c est logique
7404507 malgr une bonne deuxi me mi temps je trouve scandaleux de voir autant de passes manqu es en l2 certains joueurs ne savent pas faire de passes

7404792 cuando se le otorgaron facultades para legislar sobre el tlc con estados unidos se form una comisi n multipartidaria que deb a dar seguimiento al trabajo del ejecutivo sin embargo nunca nos convocaron e ignoraban nuestro fuero
7404793 es un error pensar que las facultades concedidas para legislar sobre el tlc habilitaban al gobierno para modificar la ley 26505 con el fin de facilitar la venta de tierras comunales cuando esto solo pod a hacerlo el congreso
7404794 yo tengo un gran respeto por la confiep he sido su presidente cuando estuve en adex pero no puedo pasar por alto este comunicado yo me pregunto qu hubiera hecho la confiep si el gobierno decid a con un decreto la manera en la que deben disponer de sus activos

7404802 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7404803 after two days of negative publicity over its extrajudicial detention of 10 tibet supporters the chinese government is seeking to suppress a story that would have cast a shadow over the closing ceremony of these olympic games which includes a final propaganda push to legitimize chinas rule in tibet with tibetans singing and dancing along with other so called ethnic minorities

7404807 i am sure the russians have left other surprises for us
7404808 they want to disrupt our life and our economy as much as possible
7404809 its been quiet where i was for the past two weeks but now i am worried even though i am happy to be back
7404810 i am afraid that what happened here with the russians will happen again
7404811 the situation in the black sea is tending to become more tense
7404812 nato countries are building up their naval presence to deliver humanitarian aid i do not think that this will contribute to the stabilization of the situation in the region
7404813 it is still not safe in certain other villages with high concentrations of cluster munitions
7404814 it was really amazing there were kids swimming out to see us and boats sailing out to meet us
7404815 it took us a day and a half to get here and most of the activists got seasick but the people here were so happy when we arrived
7404816 they came they were welcomed but what will they do tomorrow they were hoping for a long confrontation with israel now they wont have it
7404817 now that weve come through whats the excuse to keep the third boat out or the 10th boat or the 100th we did break the economic siege of gaza
7404818 are often perceived as a burden and companies consider the salaries paid to them as a form of tax
7404819 i think we have a choice with these 100 million youths that are growing up now
7404820 they can be 100 million opportunities or 100 million ticking time bombs
7404821 we thought opportunities were getting better for young indian women but the harassment only seems to be getting worse
7404822 ultimately we look forward to a debate between joe biden and barack obama about whether barack obama has the judgment and experience to lead
7404823 the choice on iraq in this election is clear and compelling
7404824 joe biden believes the war was a mistake john mccain would still do it all over again joe biden knows the bush mccain policy has weakened our hand fighting terrorism and finding osama bin laden john mccain started beating the drums for war after september 11th and wants to double down on the bush policy for four more years if barack obama and joe biden had set iraq policy these last six years rather than george bush and john mccain we wouldnt be in the hole were in today
7404825 the president always has the right to act preemptively if we are in imminent danger if they are coming up over the hill he can respond if troops are coming out of tijuana heading north we can respond if they are coming down from toronto we can respond if missiles are on their way we can respond but that is not the way i hear it being used here we are talking about preemption as if we are adopting a policy
7404826 the power of the purse is useless because it presents us with a hobsons choice
7404827 we have our fighting men and women in place and we are told by the way the president will not take them home so lets cut off the support for them so they have no guns no bullets no ability to fight a war and no one is willing to do that

7404834 to the saints who are at ephesus and who are faithful in christ jesus
7404835 for the grace of god that brings salvation has appeared to
7404836 i refuse to believe that god put men or women under the curse that is a lie of satan
7404837 if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and seek my face and pray then will i hear from heaven forgive their sins and heal their land
7404838 any concept of grace that makes us feel more comfortable sinning is not biblical grace gods grace never encourages us to live in sin on the contrary it empowers us to say no to sin and yes to truth
7404839 grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ
7404840 paul an apostle of christ jesus by the will of god
7404841 oh well thats never been my name and im just wanting to use my real name is that so bad
7404842 curt lets see that basically means masculine and strong that just isnt you
7404843 10 as it is written none is righteous no not one 11 no one understands no one seeks for god 12 all have turned aside together they have become worthless no one does good not even one
7404844 21 but now the righteousness of god has been manifested apart from the law although the law and the prophets bear witness to it 22 the righteousness of god through faith in jesus christ for all who believe
7404845 30 the times of ignorance god overlooked but now he commands all people everywhere to repent 31 because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead
7404846 first he points out the eternity of election and then how we should think of it christ says that the elect always belonged to god god therefore distinguishes them from the reprobate not by faith nor by any merit but by pure grace for while they are far away from him he regards them in secret as his own
7404847 do calvinists secretly believe that god chose them for some reason other than their need for salvation would i as a christian believe that god chose me for some other reason than my need for salvation yes i do god chose me for his glory for his pleasure for his purposes sure i had a need for salvation but that is not why he saved me primarily
7404848 in the bible god does not say he chose us because of our desperate need he chose us before our need ever arose
7404849 in fact the miracles of christ and his disciples show them giving commands be healed rise up etc to people who couldnt possibly obey yet they did god worked the miracle through them picturing salvation
7404850 if you stop and think about it even the creation account in genesis is like this god commands the light to shine but how could it possibly obey yet it does
7404851 when god prefers some to others choosing some and passing others by the difference does not depend on human dignity or indignity it is therefore wrong to say that the reprobate are worthy of eternal destruction
7404852 if what i teach is true that those who perish are destined to death by the eternal good pleasure of god though the reason does not appear then they are not found but made worthy of destruction
7404853 solomon also teaches us that not only was the destruction of the ungodly foreknown but the ungodly themselves have been created for the specific purpose of perishing prov 16 4
7404854 i dont care who you are or where you are god created you for his glory somebody says what about the drunkard in the street what about that crooked man that lost man what about him you mean hes for the glory of god my friend this is a strong pill are you read to swallow it all of that is for the glory of god oh you may say i dont like that i dont remember that god ever asked anyone where or not he liked it he has never asked me that
7404855 unregenerate elect before an elect is saved and regenerated is he accountable for his depravity
7404856 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ
7404857 how can a holy god so regard sinful mankind that his wrath does not immediately break forth when he desires to be gracious
7404858 if it wasnt for the book of mormon their faith would all come crumbling down
7404859 i assure you most solemnly i tell you unless a man is born again of water and even the spirit he cannot ever enter the kingdom of god
7404860 oh no son that means when a person is in their mothers womb they are in a protective water and when they are born they are born of the water then when we believe in adhere to cling to jesus and his saving grace through the attonement of our sins through his shed blood we are born of the spirit and he lives within us
7404861 of course ive seen people like you before you are mormons
7404862 are you going to give me some of those things you have
7404863 sure but wait a couple of weeks because i want to read this book of mormon before you return
7404864 come unto me all you who are heavy laden and i will give you rest
7404865 this isnt about jonas smith you know its about jesus christ
7404866 yes they had and that most people didnt want to talk about god
7404867 thats funny because i think you thought i was going to be argumentative did you

7404931 have you read the spec on this order a peace officer has to be able to run five miles through alleys in the dark scale walls enter homes the health inspector wouldnt touch and not wrinkle his uniform
7404932 he has to be able to sit in an undercover car all day on a stakeout cover a homicide scene that night canvass the neighborhood for witnesses and testify in court the next day
7404933 he has to be in top physical condition at all times running on black coffee and half eaten meals and he has to have six pairs of hands
7404934 its the three pairs of eyes an officer has to have
7404935 another pair here in the side of his head for his partners safety and another pair of eyes here in front that can look reassuringly at a bleeding victim and say youll be all right maam when he knows it isnt so
7404936 i already have a model that can talk a 250 pound drunk into a patrol car without incident and feed a family of five on a civil service paycheck

7404938 i told you that you were trying to put too much into this model

7405016 pada ketika itu saya sedar yang dia mempunyai kesukaran bernafas dan terus membawanya ke klinik untuk diperiksa di sana doktor menyarankan agar saya membawa ros aqidah ke hospital untuk pemeriksaan lanjut
7405017 waktu ros aqidah berada di hospital merupakan saat yang sukar untuk kami terutama apabila melihat anak kita sakit dan kita sebagai ibu tidak terdaya membantunya

7405061 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7405062 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain
7405063 the number of clinton democrats who say they would vote for mccain has gone up 11 points since june enough to account for most although not all of the support mccain has gained in that time
7405064 indeed the day after his passing we learned that yadav was to attend the melbourne aquarium on a school excursion
7405065 it therefore appears that tragic circumstances on a cold and wet night conspired to claim yadavs life
7405066 we must hope the story of yadavs brief life eagerness to learn and tragic passing proves as a parable to all people that they should take the time in their hectic lives to thank the good health of their beautiful children and families
7405067 weve seen several important reports and papers published recently all of them initially inaccessible to many people with a disability
7405068 making information as socially important and highly publicised as the grocerychoice website and the green paper on carbon emissions trading inaccessible to a significant sector of the population is put bluntly a disgrace
7405069 all organisations government departments and agencies know they should be making documents and information accessible to everyone

7405082 i havent seen a city with this mix of technology all in one place
7405083 you can work your tail off on economic development but businesses wont come if its not safe
7405084 the costs are high and the benefits in terms of law enforcement are low
7405085 people are experiencing real estate by walking down the street theyre not experiencing it in front of the computer
7405086 it takes people involved in searches one step closer to the tangible product
7405087 but then why is there always a line for jiffy lube
7405088 its an absolute mystery that obama has not been able to exploit this issue more aggressively
7405089 theres no evidence that either candidate has really connected on this issue
7405090 if he is going to win obama will have to win on the economy

7405103 certain sets of words just fit together like beads on a string
7405104 its just like that has to be a lyric ive often used things people have said to me as lyrics because i just couldnt get over how you know crushing or romantic or lonely or just simple the words fitting together were kind of like certain objects theres just so much more to them than their appearance
7405105 the part of you that writes and the part of you that hears a melody in your head that approaches a keyboard and doesnt know whats going to happen when you put your fingers on there thats a very different part of you to the one that is trained and the one that listened to music of kinds
7405106 but i just loved singing so much that it seemed like the right thing to do i learned a great deal about how to manipulate and breathe and use muscles and those things have helped me greatly
7405107 it was just like two friends being around one another and talking about music and loving music and loving organs and loving pianos and loving four tracks and this kind of intense baby was born we were two people who had very similar colours in their minds
7405108 the things we want the things we cant have the things we shouldnt be thinking about but we do think about them all the time its like a game of smoke and mirrors you know
7405109 when you can use the confusion of infatuation and personal conflict to create something that has light and dark to it and can move and affect other people then its not just something thats a deep poison inside of you
7405110 i think the brain remembers the process and it just comes again and again
7405111 i might just be looking out the window be in the train you know when youre spaced out or just thinking of memories and things
7405112 you dont have to think so much when you make it you just start and you feel and you finish

7405116 my sisters and my family never understand what i do
7405117 they know that im making music but they dont really enjoy it or understand it its a bit of a shame my mother tells me often that i am lazy in life
7405118 for me the last album that i released solo was really japanese and maybe closer to old japanese music
7405119 even now im not really a person who is really looking for something in art all the time im not intellectual
7405120 more and more i dont listen to japanese sounds but of course i have memories of melodies from japan most i think
7405121 i think because ive never learned music i will maybe always return to this in my mind

7405132 in the end the little boy was so pissed and disappointed with his overly parochial art teacher he was inspired to steal some acrylics and paint an amazing wall sized mural in the boys room and then smoked a satisfying cigarette while he sat on a urinal and admired his work
7405133 when the school authorities discovered the vandalism in the boys rest room the little boy was immediately expelled from school he never returned instead spending his time sketching ideas and painting on walls around the city later in life while being interviewed about the recent opening his wall art show in a prestigious museum he was asked about the most influential person in his career he said without hesitation my fifth grade art teacher

7405372 the really exciting thing is it doesnt commit me to anything i have some distant idea but im very far from knowing what actually happens its like being on a very dark stretch of water late at night and you can see lights in the distance but you dont quite know whats in between and how to get there
7405373 mine used to cry at your age and so what you sweat you sweat theres a ring so what
7405374 oh bullshit she just wants to wear black if anyone has hyperhydrosis its me my whole body sweats
7405375 gracies telling mandie that she has super halitosis so she can wear black

7405380 the british needed every man they could get to fight
7405381 i translated german terms and phrases for british prosecutors in the courtroom
7405382 to see the whole rogues gallery of defendants not more than 20 feet in front of me was overwhelming g ring with a derisive grin most of the time streicher rudolf hess and other nazi criminals hess was either a great actor or mentally disturbed
7405383 we had samples of tattooed human skin manufactured into lamp shades and gloves even more devastating was the collection of photographs taken by german soldiers the most haunting one showed a trench the prisoners had dug before being shot at the edge of it one of the victims looked like my mother i had trouble sleeping for nights
7405384 the humid summers were like living in hot pea soup
7405385 i did better than i thought i was going to do
7405386 oh my god am i going to have to sneeze in the middle of this thing
7405387 i want to be able to give him this give us something to think about thats more fun than surgery
7405388 it went ok but why not theres nothing to lose
7405389 we team up with the red sox on it its great
7405390 we want to encourage local businesses and organizations to help in any way they can and encourage people that may be eligible for food stamps to apply for that kind of assistance
7405391 people come out and they feel ashamed because they used to be the ones that used to drop food off here sometimes they will sit there and they will start to cry
7405392 whether people want to believe it or not the recession is bad
7405393 during the course of the investigation we determined that a drug transaction had in fact taken place officers then arrested two individuals one being keith eppich
7405394 ill just confirm that he was arrested i havent talked to him
7405395 at the same time of course the legal system has yet to play itself out on the matter
7405396 currently we have the ability to test firefighters for just cause
7405397 whether a more broadly administered drug testing policy will be implemented is a matter for collective bargaining
7405398 moody street in those days in the 40s or 50s it was like broadway itself
7405399 you think moody street is busy now in those days there was all kinds of retail stores not to mention grover cronins it truly was the center of waltham
7405400 not only was grover cronins popular in waltham it was popular in eastern massachusetts they were the first one to use escalators and the first one to use air conditioning
7405401 there was also adams department store at that time which later became the parke snow department store adams was the second strongest store in the 20s 30s and 40s next to grover cronins
7405402 after world war ii the servicemen came home and everything really boomed
7405403 the ceiling had sparkling stars it was a beautiful place it had these little lights so that it looked like stars in the sky
7405404 just in from main street on the right hand side was a theater called the central square theater
7405405 a lot of us teenagers watched a cowboy guy named tom mix in the old serial movies theyd show they had all kinds of serials we would go there every week
7405406 we had a total of seven routes that we called foot routes back in the 1950s
7405407 a section of moody street was considered one route and that went from what was called central square to the newton line
7405408 our duty was to ensure doors were secure for the evening we had to check all doors of all businesses along the moody street line and that was 24 hours a day we had eight hour routes
7405409 we made arrests once in a while for persons being drunk but that was the major problem on moody street
7405410 one night there was an auxiliary officer patrolling moody street at 9 30 p m when cronins closed their doors this auxiliary officer called the station and said he heard strange noises coming from inside building
7405411 the officers went up to the office where the safe was lo and behold they found four youngsters from waltham with sledge hammers pounding away at the safe
7405412 christmastime was a great time on moody street the crowd was so bad and the traffic was so bad on christmas
7405413 there was a total of nine policemen doing traffic on moody street thats almost one at every intersection
7405414 when we first started our business it was the end part of moody street and it was in the end of its heyday
7405415 when i was a kid and i would come down here with my mother they had every name brand store that you could think of
7405416 when grover cronins went out of business it was really kind of a dive down here
7405417 we survived but we already had a clientele down here if you were just coming in it was hard to start
7405418 once cronins left moody street had a 10 year period where it practically died and it took a 10 year period for the restaurants to bring it back
7405419 through wrestling i have learned discipline determination and how to work with people
7405420 dont you think were moving toward in the same way that the ati and nvidia gpus accelerate 3d graphics
7405421 think video games that look as good as movies and movies you can interact with
7405422 there will be around 60 scenes like this each one unique and contextual each fight is unique each situation is unique you will never see the same animation twice each scene has its own story arc its own interactivity
7405423 and all this in a very dark and mature thriller full of twists and turns

7405447 rain clouds from hebei and inner mongolia had started to move towards the capital city at 2 p m
7405448 moisture in the air was at a higher level than at the time before the opening ceremony and would more easily develop into convective clouds
7405449 we decided to use planes to cover a larger area along with firing rain dispersal rockets from the ground
7405450 three very important players were missing and the guys who got the chance today took it with both hands and made the most of it
7405451 today was the most solid performance weve had so far since ive been here
7405452 it was one of those travers where you could shuffle the deck and run them back next week and have a different outcome
7405453 i think its still big browns division and everybody else is trying to catch up
7405454 right now colonel john has to be among the top tier
7405455 he has to be right up there with big brown but thats for the experts to decide
7405456 hes one of my mentors and a very good friend as well
7405457 we generally talk almost every day at the races or are texting its going to be a very friendly competition hed love to win the title and id love to win the title if i cant win it i hope he does
7405458 you never know todd could be five in front by next week
7405459 we have a lot of nice horses and weve had a great meet its not something that we were setting our goals to do be the leading trainer but when you get there you want it a little bit you get that fire in your belly and say lets try to do that but you really cant do different than do what were doing and hope we keep winning races
7405460 you have to learn to sleep fast up here you dont get that many hours
7405461 i think in my head i convinced myself that im the best putter i think through the past weeks and months and years with the media talking about my putting and writing about my putting and people talking about my putting it kind of gets to your head that youre not a good putter
7405462 so i made a point after last week that im going to change that attitude and i putted great this week if i keep doing this im going to win a lot more golf tournaments
7405463 well it happens what can you do you cant take it the wrong way
7405464 i think the most important thing about it is that i keep putting myself in a good position and unfortunately somebody just seems to be able to come up with some spectacular playing when im out there on top i felt like i played solid all week at the end of the day i had a shot
7405465 every year for 10 years weve been coming here to watch
7405466 to be in the same circle as the worlds top players is just unbelievable
7405467 for the last three days she cant hold a racket in her hands
7405468 at first i didnt understand why i was doing this
7405469 then it started to seem like that was what i was made to do
7405470 people were very upset if i brought more than three balls
7405471 people called the police on me but shes here now
7405472 but i suppose he seems like the favorite even though ive won here the last four times i still believe its an advantage if you know how to win a u s open like you said rafa has never been beyond the quarters
7405473 i was always expected to win so maybe now it changes a little bit because obviously theres a shift in the rankings
7405474 rafa will now feel what i had to feel for a very long time so it will be interesting to see how he handles it
7405475 big satisfaction for me after long time being no 2 but at the same time nothing change no

7405480 it really matters in the sense that there is much more drama in the 2008 democratic national convention than there has been in a convention for a long time that drama is watching the first three days and wondering what the last night will look like
7405481 i think the great danger is that turning the clintonistas loose for the first three days and then expecting them to come home on the final day in visible support of obama is risky
7405482 there is a chance for things to go wrong and they do involve the clintons
7405483 this roll call vote is a little dicey this business of giving the two lead clintons air time odds are neither of them will be a problem but that roll call vote could be a problem
7405484 there is more to be lost than to be gained from the convention its important enough to avoid the loss that they do what theyre doing in order to avoid defections after the convention
7405485 to look for a camera and they will tell you nasty things about obama and say they will never support him
7405486 you watch the fourth night of the convention and you watch the end of obamas acceptance speech when presumably hillary comes on the stage
7405487 is hillary lifting obamas arm over his head saying we are in this together and he is our champion
7405488 she has to demonstrate real enthusiasm for obama and she has to shake a finger at her supporters who are not yet willing to join him
7405489 at the time i was thinking it would be a total utility savings gas water and electric

7405493 if the u s dollar is rising commodities take a hit its been a huge factor
7405494 we may see this rally in the u s dollar continue in the short term but you have to differentiate between speculation and the underlying demand for commodities
7405495 the majority of the increase in commodities over the last five years has been driven by demand from china and the emerging economies being so great that supplies havent been able to keep up

7405517 people in new york would be shocked at what one encounters in other cities these days where the panhandling can be very intimidating
7405518 panhandling has gotten especially bad in cities that have a reputation for being liberal and tolerant they have tried to be open minded but now many of them see the problem as out of control

7405531 she always had a positive attitude about everything even when things werent going well

7405533 i learned to write on a piece of paper while looking at an lcd monitor
7405534 in her mind she would probably think that people would think she was weak
7405535 she was hard working if it took coming in before school and getting some extra help she would do that
7405536 this is the highest thing any athlete can hope for it has been a very happy experience for me i am proud to bring the somali flag to fly with all of these countries and to stand with the best athletes in the world
7405537 there is no money for facilities or training the war the security the difficulties with food and everything there are just many other internal difficulties to deal with
7405538 when we went back home my friends and i were rounded up and we were told if we did it again we would get killed some of my friends stopped being in sports i had many phone calls threatening me that if i didnt stop running i would get killed lately i do not have these problems i think probably they realized we just wanted to be athletes and were not involved with the government
7405539 the food is not something that is measured and given to us every day
7405540 the stadiums i never thought something like this existed in the world
7405541 the buildings in the city it was all very surprising it will probably take days to finish all the stories we have to tell
7405542 i didnt know what it was when i saw it
7405543 the olympic fire in the stadium everywhere i am it is always up there
7405544 its like the moon i look up wherever i go it is there
7405545 the good thing sports is the one thing which unites all of somalia
7405546 because of us the somali flag is raised among all the other nations flags you cant imagine how proud we were when we were marching in the opening ceremonies with the flag
7405547 despite the difficulties and everything weve had with our country we feel great pride in our accomplishment
7405548 i was happy the people were cheering and encouraging me
7405549 but i would have liked to be cheered because i won not because i needed encouragement it is something i will work on i will try my best not to be the last person next time it was very nice for people to give me that encouragement but i would prefer the winning cheer
7405550 we know that we are different from the other athletes
7405551 but we dont want to show it we try our best to look like all the rest we understand we are not anywhere near the level of the other competitors here we understand that very very well but more than anything else we would like to show the dignity of ourselves and our country

7405594 i just tried to soak in every moment and i had the time of my life we played in four cities in china and everywhere we went the volunteers and fans went out of their way to make us feel like olympians we leave china with a special fondness in our hearts for the people of this country and these olympic games
7405595 when we first drained the lake we expected that it would be empty for about a month however we found that seals around the tower which holds the inlet pipes were deteriorating this is a tricky problem so its taken time to design a reliable repair method unfortunately the run of wet weather over the past couple of months has delayed the installation of the new seal
7405596 and given high petrol prices many people are choosing to commute by cycle for the health of their finances
7405597 there are so many reasons apart from health and fitness for getting people out of their cars and onto bikes more cyclists mean less vehicle congestion fewer parking pressures fewer greenhouse gas emissions and more liveable towns and cities
7405598 and a vital part of this plan is for us to lobby on behalf of the region for more central government funding for cycling

7405601 the combination of roberts football experience and his ability to bring people together has been a great benefit to the club
7405602 but we kept on fighting and refused to give up

7405608 the document lays out in detail a plan by telstra management to sideline unions and cut the pay of thousands of field technicians lines workers and other key staff through new job contracts
7405609 the company aims to hold workers pay to below the rate of inflation effectively cutting its wages bill by almost 15 per cent over four years
7405610 for the average technician this would amount to a cut in real wages over time of 7300 a year
7405611 telstra is a prime example of big employers who are behaving badly towards their staff and thumbing their nose at the rudd governments cooperative industrial relations policy
7405612 we expect to see new laws introduced into the parliament very soon to scrap all of work choices and replace it with a fair and balanced industrial relations system
7405613 we have taken the extra step of talking to wholesale employees about whats important to them and that will be reflected in any proposed agreement
7405614 of course our employees will be able to vote on any proposed agreement

7405616 to ensure we would be in a position to get the settings right and provide continuity during a difficult period
7405617 nothing changed expect to the extent that when we extended mikes contract we believed and we were absolutely right that we were entering a very difficult environment
7405618 we wanted to have the option of security of tenure we also wanted mike to get the setting right for us as we got into the storm
7405619 we believe weve probably passed through the eye of the storm
7405620 weve had that continuity and weve now come to an agreement with mike that he step down
7405621 i cant say that the markets are turning very quickly but were prepared for the environment were in
7405622 its highly unlikely he will play again this year its time for the legal process to take place because i dont know all the facts
7405623 he will be stood down until the police matter is much clearer

7405725 they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like them or anti immigrant sentiment or anti trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations

7405730 please the faster you stow your bags in the overhead compartment the faster well get to the democratic convention in denver
7405731 on august 5 prior to the beijing games pastor romero had transformed two hotel rooms creating effigies of blood spattered torture victims and painting human rights slogans such as our world our nightmare the protest took place just days before president bush issued his strong condemnation of abuse of religious freedom in china after the protest pastor romero went into hiding and has been living in the open with the protection of a small shelter existing on rations he bought before leaving beijing
7405732 pastor eddie romero is a much loved church leader professor and family man whose actions are driven by deepest concern for the abused in china he took this exceptional step in order to draw much needed attention to the plight of those suffering persecution for their faith and other beliefs
7405733 while csw does not condone civil disobedience we strongly endorse the validity of the calls he is making for china to ratify the iccpr and to release the named prisoners his courage in handing himself over to the chinese authorities shows the depths with which he identifies with the suffering of the chinese people
7405734 china persecution of protestant christians in the approach to the beijing 2008 olympic games
7405735 a whopping 96 percent thinks that the olympics will be a success but a much lower percentage are satisfied with their jobs and family life etc so within this context of high satisfaction with the country and low satisfaction with the daily life we find that religious interest is very high in china today
7405736 the roads are being blocked by felling trees and attacks on christians have started
7405737 several church buildings are destroyed christian houses are torched and christians under attack
7405738 he was attacked by a mob and they were almost setting him on fire but the fire did not catch
7405739 by gods grace the police rescued him and have taken custody of him we are trying to get him released
7405740 we thank god that the government officials are protecting our campus and our people
7405741 and are on rampage to destroy several christian houses the condition may be same with other churches all over orissa
7405742 today the country of georgia has attacked the russian people of south ossetia killing thousands and causing a humanitarian disaster this is genocide against the russian people in response our russian peacekeeping forces have entered georgia to protect our people and bring peace against the georgian aggressor financed and supported by the united states
7405743 the lord said to my lord sit at my right hand until i make your enemies the footstool of your feet the lord shall send forth the rod of your power from zion and rule in the midst of your enemies with you is the beginning in the day of your power in the brightness of your saints i have begotten you from the womb before the morning star the lord swore and will not repent you are a priest forever according to the order of melchiszedek
7405744 from that day on no one dared to question him anymore
7405745 therefore many of his disciples when they heard this said this is a hard saying who can understand it
7405746 the remission of sins the pardon of transgessions the communion in the holy spirit the inheritance of the kingdom of heaven confidence in him not judgment or condemnation

7405750 america is not at war the marines are at war america is at the mall
7405751 have i told you today how grateful i am to have you blogging on my side
7405752 i think definitely you have to give a lot of credit to catcher geovany soto weve been working pretty well together im comfortable with him behind the plate i think a lot of it is mixing up pitches keeping them guessing
7405753 when he doesnt get behind in the count and throw a lot of balls its tough
7405754 he can throw anywhere from 88 to 91 and kind of sink it he can come with 95 to 97 its just tough to pick up he throws everything from the same arm angle
7405755 we wanted to shorten his stride its a simple little thing getting his hands set a little quicker so his swing is shorter more compact and into the ball
7405756 lou gave me his point of view on what he thought i should change
7405757 i was able to work on it a little bit in the cage but during the game i cant think of stuff like that while im at bat so i wasnt able to fully introduce what he told me
7405758 im getting pitches to drive and im not missing them
7405759 he could be out for 10 days or as much as two weeks we are just waiting to see what type of a heeler hes going to be
7405760 if we have the choice of having him for one game or 15 well take the 15
7405761 i think we were very soft in our pass protection in our run game we had a lack of sustaining one on one blocks on the first four passes that jason threw he had somebody walked back into him or he had somebody in his face it is very difficult to play qb from that position they played very aggressive football and we didnt match that intensity
7405762 for both teams because it was a chance to see what the starters could do for a longer period of time and we didnt do anything
7405763 obviously we can look forward to whats in front of us
7405764 being able to sweep baltimore definitely puts us in a much better situation against boston
7405765 i have a bunch of guys that just gave their hearts and souls to that game and i hope you understand that
7405766 i wish i would have had about 15 more minutes to sit out there with my team instead of come out here as quickly as i did thats how tough it is for me to process
7405767 i was trying to go down and away i didnt execute the pitch and big league hitters thats what theyre supposed to do
7405768 this was a big game we knew we had a chance to sweep and any time you can do that you have to take advantage of it especially where we are right now
7405769 its always nice to come home and were going to have an important series at home
7405770 weve just got to keep doing what weve been doing
7405771 when you lose the first two games of a series i think youre going to have a quick hook with anybody
7405772 it was like i never pitched before im disgusted with my outing
7405773 hello whos the adult here you dont put your six year old son in charge of the baby you do it yourself my gosh am i the only adult around here cant i trust you to handle anything

7405789 aircraft operators are required to secure each aircraft when left unattended
7405790 apparently the tsa inspector hoisted himself up using the tat probe as a stirrup
7405791 we caught it this time but who knows if this has happened other times and with other planes that are out there
7405792 pilots are the last line of defense we do our pre flight inspections but we dont have a system in place to check for broken parts
7405793 it is not tsas intent to cause delays or potential damage to aircraft as a result of our inspections
7405794 the inspector was able to gain access to the interior of seven of the nine aircraft inspected which is an apparent violation of the airlines security program
7405795 tsa is reviewing the inspection results and depending on the conclusion could take action with the airline up to and including levying of civil penalties
7405796 if not observed by vigilant eagle employees in chicago the actions of this inspector would have been unknown and could have jeopardized the safety of our customers and crew because of potential damage to the sensitive equipment mounted on the aircraft fuselage
7405797 american eagle is also concerned that the tsa inspectors method of physically hoisting himself up to the jet bridge using a part of the aircraft could have placed him in physical danger
7405798 the brilliant employees used an instrument located just below the cockpit window that is critical to the operation of the onboard computers
7405799 they decided this instrument the tat probe would be adequate to use as a ladder
7405800 are now doing things to our aircraft that may put our lives and the lives of our passengers at risk

7405819 i still dont expect us to regain the majority in the house
7405820 this thursday night well have six guys no seven guys that wont be attending the game
7405821 robert marve will be our starting quarterback for the season
7405822 some people may think this is a harsh decision because im such a stickler about the little things but one thing i do know if you do the little things but you forget about them they add up to big things and that will cause a lot of problems for your team as i saw were going to build a championship team were going to do it the right way and were going to keep enforcing those things to make a better team and better program and always doing the right thing and like i said before some schools may not be as harsh as we are but were the university of miami and thats the stand we take
7405823 many marves father talked about him possibly being bitter over the delayed benching any chace of marve transfering if harris excells
7405824 i think all of us are confused and stunned by this news
7405825 there are not many things around the country that compare to hurricane football kirby hocutt
7405826 well finally be able to see replays if something isnt right
7405827 what are these suspensions all about team violations or academics
7405828 im not saying marve will transfer but you have to imagine this wasnt the way he envisioned his career starting at um
7405829 the bible says the meek shall inherit the earth but there was no trace of meekness in faytene kryskow and her passionate preaching yesterday on parliament hill
7405830 were going to turn parliament hill into the wailing wall
7405831 during the summer all restaurants experience a drop in their turnover but i have not seen it yet even though its been predicted
7405832 next february and march are also booked because people book so far in advance now for the special occasion i never dreamt it would be like that
7405833 repeat business is a huge thing and i honestly think there is enough of that to bring us through
7405834 people still want to go out for a good and a nice experience and they book so far ahead they do not want to be let down
7405835 when i was 26 i was running the seventh best restaurant in the world tom aikens in chelsea and this is the first restaurant i have run here in ireland
7405836 we have registered an increase in georgias reconnaissance activities and preparations for armed actions in the georgian south ossetian conflict zone
7405837 i dont see why a public holiday is needed as the by election is exclusively for the permatang pauh constituency this declaration must have been a political decision
7405838 why a public holiday does guan eng know what kind of losses factories and businessmen will incur because of the holiday
7405839 my task was only to hear the oath and i had no part in the drafting of the oath which saiful made it is also unimportant for me so specify who
7405840 i also wish to deny that i received any money to witness the swearing i was only acting on instructions
7405841 during the swearing saiful mis pronounced one of the islamic words because he had it written down in malay instead of arabic
7405842 wallahi wabillahi watallahi with allah as my witness i swear i do not know or have any connection with the mongolian woman
7405843 have mercy on me o lord son of david my daughter is severely oppressed by a demon
7405844 send her away for she is crying out after us
7405845 i was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of israel
7405846 it is not right to take the childrens bread and throw it to the dogs
7405847 yes lord yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters table
7405848 o woman great is your faith be it done for you as you desire
7405849 it is not right to take the childrens bread the bread of the persons of the house of israel and throw it to the dogs to persons like the canaanite woman
7405850 como configurar o teclado no mac os x 10 5 leopard
7405851 but gabriel youve just done that with contest 9 here
7405852 the 16 day sport event has brought enormous joy and enthusiasm to the humanity and has won glory for both the host city beijing and the olympics
7405853 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7405854 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7405855 i think the bills insider does a great job of following the bills they give the most accurate facts and in depth stories that i have found on the internet keep up the great work
7405856 billsinsider com is a great website bills fans are unbelievably rabid and knowledgeable good stuff
7405857 im just trying to make the best of my opportunities
7405858 lay hands on computer tower quietly breathing then push the power button and beg god to make it work please oh please god just make it work pleeeaaaaassssseee
7405859 hes been chasing rabbits and quail in the back yard so hes very strong
7405860 his training is a bunch of love and his soccer ball
7405861 if these issues remain in this order going into november obama wins nevada its that simple
7405862 what has to happen is the more republican type issues have to increase in importance or voters have to feel mccain is better trusted on those issues
7405863 if the war on terror goes up into the double digits thats probably good news for mccain in nevada
7405864 they are blaming and assessing the blame for the current economic downturn on the current administration
7405865 a lot of voters are blaming republicans and mccain is assuming some of that blame
7405866 my plan is not going to bring about economic disaster we already have economic disaster from john mccains president george w bush
7405867 and hes been so tied to the bush administration that i think its guilt by association
7405868 mccain hasnt spent as much time talking about sustaining the tax cuts and the housing problem and the gas price issue as he should
7405869 but i think as it ends up the economy will be a stronger issue for mccain than obama
7405870 at the end of it when you boil all the fanfare away barack obama is for raising taxes
7405871 casino carpet is known as an exercise in deliberate bad taste that somehow encourages people to gamble
7405872 people always dont notice the rainbows in the carpet but they have a perception of good luck
7405873 you dont want a real plain carpet because people drop cigarettes on it and spill drinks on it
7405874 it is the same thing as putting canopies on tops of tables which has become popular that lowers the ceiling people dont look up at the spaciousness and concentrate more where the action is
7405875 the fact is at the places that have the most play the attention of the visitors is focused on the gaming equipment just like in a department store which frank winfield woolworth thought of in 1878
7405876 what would be the real issue here is gambling is a hyper experience nobody gambles to relax they gamble for the adrenalin rush therefore it is possible that a more exciting carpet pattern will create a more exciting atmosphere but nobody has ever demonstrated that
7405877 i am not arguing against it but i could not find the impact
7405878 but i emphasize that doesnt mean it is not there
7405879 note the regal tones of caesars palace the bountiful bouquet of mandalay place the soft almost abstract pointillism of paris all whispering gamble gamble just out of the range of consciousness as people walk to the nearest slot machine
7405880 you are trying to create an ambiance that is going to encourage people to stick around and play
7405881 so you cant treat carpets all by themselves they are part of the integrated pull
7405882 in that world it is not enough simply to provide games and play one has to understand as deeply as possible what play is and then build play grounds
7405883 you want to get that sense of vibrancy and energy with carpet that something is going on
7405884 the curve welcomes us and the oversharp angle rejects us the angle is masculine and the curve feminine the beloved curve has nest like powers it incites us to possession it is a curved corner inhabited geometry
7405885 the most enticing and alluring and stimulating casino spaces are those which make principal use of the curvilinear rather than the straight
7405886 many of the carpets use flowers and wheels both suggestive of a cyclical life flowers bud bloom and then die and their beauty is only ephemeral
7405887 the wheel was famous to the romans note its prominence at caesars palace as a symbol of the relentless capriciousness of fortune you must fill out the comment body in order to submit a comment subscribe

7405889 im very excited about tallying the data from this important online casinos survey
7405890 this is the first time weve asked for public participation in our scientific research and were absolutely flattered and grateful by the turn out i expect preliminary results will be tabulated by next month at which point well release general findings about important online casinos trends in this society to the local media
7405891 weve seen some very interesting commonalities across cultures ethnicities and various different societies online casinos survey takers were very considerate in their answers and this helped us greatly to further tune our hypotheses in the end well have a great set of data to analyze and study for the future as we continue to review how online casinos factors work in society
7405892 i chose not to answer that question because it had nothing to do with the study of online casinos and everything to do with my personal finances as a result i did not qualify for a compensatory gift but that is fine privacy is important even if were collecting data for academic purposes
7405893 usually i just sign off on results and make sure they are published in a timely matter but this time i really wanted to get hands on with this online casinos subject matter so i decided to aide my fellow employees with statistical measurements and data analysis personally im very curious about local online casinos ideas and trends
7405894 i was impressed with the publics awareness of online casinos trends in their daily lives ive been studying them for months now and some surveyees raised questions that i couldnt readily answer in those cases i referred them to write their comments down and submit them to our directors for further review
7405895 for those surveyees that took part in all three of the online casinos survey sections we offered three different forms of compensation a cash gift of 50 gift certificate to a local restaurant or a gift card for the upcoming holiday season at the local mall
7405896 and 50 cash is a nice gift i also added my name to the online casinos studys contact list for future surveys interviews and any public discussions its a very interesting and important topic
7405897 nevada is definitely a state in play which means were likely to see the good speakers at our breakfasts
7405898 i think that 7 oclock breakfast is going to come very early
7405899 theyll vote republican one day and democrat the next it depends on who they feel is better on their issues
7405900 sen mccain may be the senator from arizona but he is still of washington d c
7405901 he seemed to appeal well to people here when he was in nevada running before he dropped out i know a lot of folks who were supporters of his early on in the primary
7405902 one of the things we saw during the debates is his ability to speak about foreign relations in a very understandable way
7405903 voters in the west are not immune to being concerned about our countrys place in the world
7405904 append to usr local psa admin logs httpsd error log usr t
7405905 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7405906 hes got the passion to lift up middle class americans he hasnt forgotten his working class roots he has the expertise that will make him a great counselor on international crises that might come up
7405907 one of the greatest vice presidents in the history of the united states
7405908 i was shocked and confused i was filled with so many emotions no matter what happened at big brother i had spent considerable time with her in the house
7405909 i felt really bad for her now i know why i couldnt recognise her when i met her life has put her through so much she had changed
7405910 speaking to her was not easy it was very tough there was never any rancour
7405911 yes i was hurt when in the big brother house she made some comments about our country but even in the house we had made peace after the initial rancour once i was out of the house the media went to town and she got the brunt of it
7405912 believe me it was really sad when jade was slammed i never wanted to become a champion of the third world at her cost
7405913 yeah when the channel decided on jade they asked me if it was okay with me if i had any ill feelings towards her id have said no to jade but the truth is there was no ill feelings towards jade
7405914 my only precondition was that jade should be treated well at
7405915 to my delight the big boss contestants were very nice to jade i felt so proud to see how she was treated it just reiterated the fact we indians are very forgiving and welcoming
7405916 jades illness is not gimmick she mustve done pap smear cancer screening method before coming to india how would she know the tests would be so damning
7405917 neither passenger nor goods trains were allowed to move from stations
7405918 protesters damaged at least five vehicles two in rourkela and three in the coastal district of balasore
7405919 terrorists by the gujarat police interestingly saturdays terror e mail refers to several issues concerning investigations into the recent gujarat blasts
7405920 the police had said that the four were on their way to kill chief minister narendra modi the then deputy inspector general d g vanzara had said vanzara was arrested last year for allegedly staging the fake encounter of a gangster
7405921 to say anything whether there is any connection between the gujarat encounter and the e mail senders is too early all the options of investigation are open and we will probe the case from all directions said an officer
7405922 whether the e mail sender wanted to mislead investigators or the selection of this ip address was pre planned is yet to be established nothing can be ruled out at this point of time said the officer
7405923 a market survey of japanese figurine catalog shows that only a very small percentage of figurines are adult oriented figurines made by good reputable companies like good smile and alter are 100 clean and fit for all ages
7405924 the response to the festival has surpassed all our expectations in fact we are already gearing for preparations for next year
7405925 we will definitely restore the judges but after some debate in parliament
7405926 it is difficult to debate this issue for one day and i am not sure if the judges could be restored on monday aug 25
7405927 will give in writing to parliament that he did many wrong things in the past and that he will not participate in politics in the future after getting his written assurance parliament will provide him indemnity
7405928 the pml n has refused to become part of any indemnity for musharraf at any cost
7405929 estamos decepcionados porque china no ha aprovechado la oportunidad de los juegos para demostrar mayor tolerancia y apertura

7405934 i tried to mix what is gap and what is colette
7405935 it is coming from dada art when they were doing this type of thing
7405936 i am in the middle of all the fashion brands
7405937 for me i wear the gap only when it is special collections
7405938 were making it more intelligent and giving it a personality
7405939 were adding another layer to the brand the idea is to make a personalized store
7405940 a lot of people hate suits because when they fit terribly they feel strange inside like theyre going to a bar mitzvah and theyre 30
7405941 we started in the ninth position and to get a top five finish at a course that is very difficult to pass at is great
7405942 the pain was coming and going to steer left was really difficult but i just had to go to push
7405943 we have some room to improve and run against the bigger teams but today proved that we can compete with them
7405944 the car was superb i was pushing it to the limit there was nothing left out there
7405945 i guess we just need to shrug it off and come back strong next week
7405946 im not upset with anybody particularly we just did absolutely nothing right
7405947 with everything that happened this week we never lost faith
7405948 when you see guys doing that you just want to do your best
7405949 our reception of the prisoners tomorrow will be like a national wedding
7405950 releasing these kinds of prisoners indicates that the criteria israel used in the past will not endure this clears the way for other prisoners
7405951 these settlements are supposed to be the nail in the coffin of any future peace agreement with the palestinians
7405952 this place is holy to the jewish people and we have a duty to be here
7405953 the whole land of israel belongs to us and we should not be afraid to live wherever we want to the arabs must accept that
7405954 we are connected to the water grid we have phone lines from the national company bezeq we have been hooked up by the electricity company and have street lighting
7405955 we also have a kindergarten paid for by the state and a group of soldiers stationed here to protect us how can we be illegal
7405956 we can also see all the arabs from here and keep an eye on what they are doing
7405957 and in addition we can see the other settlements and check on their safety
7405958 they are very afraid that this will become simply the first of many settlements to fall
7405959 the settlers know that preparation of an alternative site could take years
7405960 the danger is that migron will be destroyed only to be resurrected in legalised form by the government as a new settlement close by adam
7405961 we believe it is possible to find a solution for the outposts that will strengthen the settlements
7405962 terror has seized you the fear of defeat seizes your heart often causing you to cower
7405963 dread your heart is heavy in the face of such evil
7405964 like this one you see here is made out of aquamarine
7405965 i like it when people find something that relates to them
7405966 oh noes my thoughts and feelings people are reading them
7405967 at 12 30 pm a cessna 206 was taking off from baptiste lake lost airspeed and entered a wooded area west of the lake
7405968 they come up with anything to make sure an incumbent doesnt have a race
7405969 erred in failing to consider any of the evidence submitted to it or address any of the issues raised in this proceeding before making its determination
7405970 you shouldnt be trying to be a lawmaker when you are a lawbreaker
7405971 i hope u get f ked in ur mouth scum pees of s t ur face is a anus bitch
7405972 if youre really interested in making your relationship work little rituals are a great way to do it
7405973 every marriage has what i call a relationship reservoir or the stored up emotional energy of the relationship
7405974 honey what do you think is the one thing most important to a successful marriage
7405975 it all started one winter night years ago when julie had had a really bad day
7405976 we were huddled under the covers of our bed and julie was describing how all the people who made her day miserable were bad polar bears and how she didnt want any of the bad polar bears coming into the bedroom and how the bed was our refuge from them you realize how embarrassing it is to admit this right anyway thats when we started calling the bed the igloo
7405977 its our little sanctuary only nice things happen in the igloo
7405978 its funny because i always thought that when you lived with somebody youd automatically know everything that was going on
7405979 but we find that if we dont take that time to connect with each other its really easy for life to get in the way the igloo offers one of the few times in the day where theres not a whole heck of a lot else going on so youre able to focus on each other in a deeper way
7405980 but its always a nice way for us to catch up
7405981 hes just my best friend and our marriage is a great partnership and theres no one id rather talk to
7405982 because we know plenty of married couples who fight a lot about how often they have sex the wifes upset because all he ever wants to do is have sex the husbands upset because he doesnt think they have sex enough but this has never really been a problem with us and i think it has a lot do with the fact that were always talking sexy to each other
7405983 were always complimenting each other tossing out fantasies telling each other were hot he gets to feel like he can have sexual feelings and i feel like i dont have to have sex all the time to appear attractive
7405984 lets put it this way the way i see it sex is like chocolate cake after five days of eating chocolate cake even chocolate cake doesnt taste that great
7405985 we are so disgusting this is so pathetic its like a sickness
7405986 look we get a kick out of it because its so ridiculous its our guilty pleasure
7405987 honestly i think we just need to be dumb for a while
7405988 were both very into our careers and when youre at work with any job theres going to be a certain amount of professional stress you like to come home sometimes and for that lousy hour or whatever kick back and relax
7405989 life is serious enough isnt it sometimes you need to do something stupid and if you cant be stupid with your husband who can you be stupid with
7405990 honey dont forget at 7 15 we have our nightly cuddle followed by the affirmation of our vows our 7 35 spontaneous flirtation and then of course a new episode of
7405991 you know that old saying how can i miss you if you dont go away
7405992 doing things separately gives you a chance to fill in the blanks that your partner cant fill in for you for example one of you likes classical music the other one likes sports plus taking a break from each other gives you more things to talk about because when youre joined at the hip whats to talk about youve already seen it all
7405993 as a woman you get this message that when you get married you spend every single waking second with your husband and youre so unbelievably happy
7405994 and my parents actually do spend every single waking second together and oddly enough they are happy
7405995 and yeah they spent every moment together but they spent every moment together at each others throats
7405996 so joe had to convince me that having our own lives was a good idea
7405997 it all brings a freshness to our marriage because we both continue to grow as people
7405998 getting out of the house and out of each others hair keeps us from going crazy
7405999 we have been married for seven years but praying together is something we didnt start doing until about a year ago
7406000 in the past whenever we faced big decisions wed have discussion after discussion about them but wed never really come to a resolution
7406001 i soon found that praying together brings out a real sense of selflessness and humility
7406002 when youre praying for each other not yourself youre focused together and speaking from the heart on a whole different level i would never have predicted this for us but it really works
7406003 as bad as any problem may seem at that moment
7406004 prayer always helps us see beyond it it doesnt have to be a long drawn out scripture reading just a few minutes a day when we pray it brings another level of honesty to our conversations i think its the most intimate thing you can do with another person
7406005 i guess you mean black people african americans as people also say these days
7406006 come on man get modern people dont say colored anymore
7406007 well around where i live they dont and they dont in most other places either i like living with different kinds of people and its not dangerous if thats what youre thinking hasnt been to me anyway youre just being prejudiced
7406008 sure i guess but i dont know what theyd write it on
7406009 i was going to say that was mighty white of him but you know
7406010 i bet you were just itching to say something about that one
7406011 yes i was something im not sure what though or if its really worth it
7406012 right you cant change those kinds of attitudes with just one comment
7406013 well maybe hed think twice before saying it again and what a weird thing to say actually i havent heard that one since i was kid
7406014 oh i have people at the mill still say that sometimes
7406015 really what do you think they mean by it do they really mean white as in racially white
7406016 actually no i dont think they do i think its usually just a compliment or a way of saying thanks it used to work in a more racial way of course back in the fifties or sixties but now its pretty much detached from race
7406017 but then bill knew it was wrong he didnt want to say it in front of that kid
7406018 right but i dont think he necessarily knew it was wrong because its racist he just knew it had some kind of bite to it so you shouldnt say it around kids
7406019 her hair is so beautiful its so shiny and smooth and its so black
7406020 but like me no one knows when that place had actual camps or how many workers there were or what they did i suspect they came up to build the railroad then left when that work was done
7406021 right i picked cherries with them when i was a kid migrant workers i havent seen any around since then
7406022 more migrants hands unwelcome except for what they can do temporarily with their hands
7406023 the democrats have shattered precedent with presumptive nomination of an african american it is impossible to know in advance whether or not voters will be negatively influenced by obamas race the keys however are a robust system that has endured through vast changes in the electorate the economy the society and the technology of elections it is unlikely that even a path breaking nominee will alter the negative verdict on the party in power
7406024 millions will watch you as you sink right down to the ground
7406025 barack obama knows a lot about housing problems one of his biggest fundraisers helped him buy his million dollar mansion purchasing part of the property he couldnt afford
7406026 rezkos wife did buy an adjoining tract but later sold the land at a profit obama paid market price for his home
7406027 from obama rezko got political favors including 14 million from taxpayers now hes a convicted felon facing jail
7406028 theres no evidence of any connection to the obama home purchase
7406029 we thought it was worth it if only to find out that our only insulation was a single layer of tar paper
7406030 our solar hot water system is working very well it cut our summer gas use last year by 1 3 to 1 2
7406031 we havent run the numbers for winter but youd be surprised how many days it kicks in even when its cold outside
7406032 i have this picture of me holding a medical apartheid sign from one of the protests
7406033 yeah pharmacists are clinicians were supposed to take care of people but we end up working more with insurance companies and barely at all with people
7406034 sometimes people will listen just because im a pharmacist it opens doors
7406035 nylon guys your son pilot inspektor do i even have to ask

7406065 lo m s destacado de esta pel cula son las escenas de acci n y los sorprendentes efectos visuales que se est n haciendo en postproducci n estoy deseando verlo sobre el kamehameha a n s lo puedo imaginarlo estoy muy emocionado
7406066 goku tiene un estilo de lucha h brido entre capoeira y karate
7406067 estamos esperando a que se diga cuando viaja el jugador y yo creo que este lunes por la ma ana ya se dar el anuncio oficial por parte del betis pero ya pr cticamente est atado
7406068 si no es ma ana pasado nery tiene que estar ac
7406069 la gente del betis ha estado siguiendo much simo a nery y obviamente ellos se quieren quedar a final de a o con el jugador lo que pasa es que de momento por la situaci n que ten a con el pr stamo del manchester city por la situaci n con el shakhtar se tuvo que tomar esta decisi n
7406070 la televisi n es una gran cosa en la forma en que es no queremos reemplazar la televisi n queremos aumentar y dar valor a la experiencia de la televisi n
7406071 queremos casar las mejores propuestas del mundo de la televisi n con las mejores propuestas del mundo de internet
7406072 me acabo de enterar que se lesion mart n y eso me produce una gran tristeza al principio estaba contento por el triunfo de boca sobre lan s por 2 1 pero luego supe de esa mala noticia
7406073 es un gran orgullo haber ganado esta medalla ha sido una gran experiencia en todo sentido la que hemos vivido en china
7406074 we have highlighted the negatives as well as the positives each area is not without risk but with due diligence you should be able to avoid the pitfalls owning something in these areas may not impress your neighbours just yet but in a few years they may well be jealous
7406075 i dont know when its coming but i bet its coming
7406076 its been such an honor to get this kind of attention i cannot believe five words would cause this and everybody from everywhere would know who the hat lady from greenwood is
7406077 i had a funnel cake in one hand and a mojito in the other
7406078 its a unique opportunity to raise the visibility of our organization and advocate positions that are important to us
7406079 it started with a couple of us that used to meet for coffee and it just started to grow
7406080 this really is not connected with a school or classes
7406081 i sometimes wonder why the people come out here like this but you can see what theyre doing theyre greeting each other seeing old friends
7406082 the best thing i ever heard is when a lady walked up to me and said oh im so glad i came
7406083 in october a couple from arizona plans their trip home for the coal crackers club because they always want to be here for it
7406084 my wife jean opie johnson is from shamokin im from lewisburg but anyone who has ties to the greater shamokin area theyre always welcome
7406085 one thing ive seen as an outsider if you make a friend in the coal region youve got a friend for life
7406086 you start coming and you see people you know and pretty soon you cant wait until the next one
7406087 we have fun together and were going to continue to stick together
7406088 you give your e mail address you fill out a page about yourself and then you can have friends in cyberspace so you can have these groups that organize kids theres messaging that goes on these web sites where theyre told to be at a certain place come to this meeting participate in this way
7406089 well that makes a great cover for the harvesting of human organs doesnt it
7406090 competition is the key to progress provided that self glorification and self aggrandizement is perceived to be the hoped for final product both selfish gain and selfish path complement and reinforce each other to replace competition with collaboration we will have to socialise the masses mindset to view collective glorification and collective aggrandizement as the hoped for final product only then will collaboration be perceived as the method by which progress is best pursued
7406091 nicolas sarkozy kaboul la phrase qui fait tiquer le net
7406092 if i were london id be embarrassed right now i dont think they should even bother with an opening ceremony in four years just march the athletes into the stadium hey kids wave at the camera raise a few flags sing a few anthems and break out the brew
7406093 well you know who has to be worried right about now vancouver bc
7406094 snow eh snow eh snow eh did you know no two snowflakes are alike eh
7406095 herr mehdorn nutzt nur den spielraum den ihm der alleingesellschafter bundesrepublik deutschland bel sst
7406096 und er nutzt diesen spielraum nicht zur erh hung der kapazit t und der leistung des systems eisenbahn in deutschland sondern f r investitionen auf der ganzen welt
7406097 the entire community is concerned that we have a united not divided austin and that the city council show leadership in guaranteeing that
7406098 call on austin to unite as a city and to work together with city management
7406099 this man is being treated less than a professional he is in a job that requires that he operate at a level that they arent accustomed to seeing blacks operate at
7406100 he reminded us several times that he was a minority like us
7406101 he made it clear that he did not govern by fear that he was a fearless individual and would not be intimidated by anyone
7406102 im nervous more because i dont know the systems and the city the exciting part is meeting the students and the other teachers
7406103 right now my biggest worries are setting up my classroom and figuring out what im going to do the first week
7406104 its been crazy having to move on top of everything else but this academy has definitely made me feel better about it
7406105 whether youre a first year teacher or a teacher who is already in the classroom and just joining us we want to honor you and welcome you into a community of learning
7406106 its still one of the most professionally rewarding things ive ever done
7406107 if anything im most concerned about the hourglass at the state
7406108 ive come up with my four perls of wisdom preparation effort respect and responsibility and being locked into learning
7406109 in middle school the biggest issues are who likes who
7406110 in high school theres sex drugs whos got money kids are dropping out and figuring out what theyre going to do with their lives its just a lot more complicated
7406111 a senior practicing judge or lawyer whose life and practice display sterling character and unquestioned integrity coupled with ongoing dedication to the highest standards of the legal profession
7406112 end free lifetime health care for lawmakers and bring their retirement benefits in line with other state workers
7406113 the proposed amendment does not spell out the true intent of the measure which is to heavily rewrite the states constitution
7406114 we are delighted with the cmas capital market authoritys historic resolution which we believe will greatly enhance the depth and breadth of the saudi capital market
7406115 this development will undoubtedly increase foreign capital inflows to the kingdoms stock market promote greater transparency reduce volatility associated with dominance of the retail investors in the saudi market and encourage more comprehensive equity research on listed companies
7406116 there is huge demand from international investors for entry into the kingdoms markets
7406117 the tadawul has the largest number of blue chip companies in the middle east a market capitalisation that stands around 500 billion constituting approximately one percent of the capitalisation of the global equity markets
7406118 as we have worked for a long time at establishing the necessary platform and mechanism
7406119 our steel project in west bengal is on schedule and we will commence construction work of the project from november this year
7406120 if kids arent sleeping at night it can affect their school work and mental development
7406121 if children are allowed to sleep properly a lot of these behavioral issues are improved
7406122 if the u s dollar is rising commodities take a hit its been a huge factor
7406123 we may see this rally in the u s dollar continue in the short term but you have to differentiate between speculation and the underlying demand for commodities
7406124 the majority of the increase in commodities over the last five years has been driven by demand from china and the emerging economies being so great that supplies havent been able to keep up
7406125 the nature of the practice began to change last year with the opening of memorial hermann sports medicine
7406126 we began to see a large sports medicine practice i think our fellowship is the only one like it in the country
7406127 the huge advantage with this fellowship is the interactive way we work with the team physicians and the athletes
7406128 the most common are hips and shoulders but we also treat a lot of wrists knees and ankles
7406129 with tendon inflammation you have to be very careful to guide the medication to a site close to the tendon without hitting the tendon which could rupture it
7406130 being able to work as a team with the surgeons and the athletes on a daily basis helps us make a more accurate report about the injury leading to less risk less complications and a smaller scar
7406131 estoy muy satisfecho con el resultado me qued muy cerca de hacer mi mejor marca personal que apenas hice en el campeonato mundial de este a o y creo que esto es el indicio de que el pr ximo ciclo ol mpico puede ser a n mejor para el pentatl n moderno mexicano
7406132 la esgrima me ayudo a avanzar poco a poco fui de menos a m s estaba en el lugar 28 y ya con la equitaci n y cerrando bastante bien con mi prueba fuerte que es la carrera sub hasta el octavo y eso es lo que me da m s gusto
7406133 considerando que estados unidos canad cuba o brasil tuvieron a dos representantes cada uno y que yo fui s lo por m xico terminar como el mejor pentatleta de am rica en los juegos me motiva much simo y abre posibilidades de resultados m s grandes
7406134 las chicas jugaron bien vamos mejorando el nivel y los resultados se est n dando tenemos cuatro a os para trabajar m s a n ahora estamos a la espera de ver si bibiana y mayra podr n asistir a algunas competencias internacionales que son del world tour de la fivb para cerrar esta temporada
7406135 no regreso satisfecha con el resultado creo que pudo ser mejor hubo algunas situaciones del jueceo que no nos dejaron muy convencidos pero s que dejamos el m s grande esfuerzo en la competencia
7406136 although momentum has not yet been officially launched we already have big plans for the company
7406137 one of the most significant is the construction of the international logistics city in sharjah which will offer top quality services to all clients and will allow them to manage their entire supply chain from a single location
7406138 being ugly is not a requirement for becoming a nun external beauty is a gift from god and we mustnt hide it
7406139 nuns are a bit excluded they are a bit marginalised in ecclesiastical life
7406140 this will be an occasion to make their contribution more visible
7406141 we are not going to parade nuns in bathing suits
7406142 its an initiative that belittles the role of nuns who have dedicated themselves to god
7406143 being ugly is not a requirement for becoming a nun external beauty is a gift from god and we mustnt hide it
7406144 nuns are a bit excluded they are a bit marginalised in ecclesiastical life
7406145 people are experiencing real estate by walking down the street theyre not experiencing it in front of the computer
7406146 it takes people involved in searches one step closer to the tangible product
7406147 but then why is there always a line for jiffy lube
7406148 the water is very deep its already at everybodys door
7406149 the reception is an opportunity for sen clinton to see her delegates many for the first time since the primaries ended thank them for their hard work and support and most importantly to encourage them to support and work for sen obama as strongly as she has in order to elect him in november
7406150 what if i cant carry it what if i trip and fall
7406151 the standing hurt a little but it was all worth it i had tears in my eyes when the flame was lit
7406152 i want to fight castro thats why i want to be your commissioner
7406153 its the type of hit that occurs once or twice a year around the world
7406154 i have guys i have to take care of right now
7406155 we have to take care of the gfeller family and their wishes too but we have a football team i have to take care of and seven other coaches and we have to get ourselves back together and be able to get through this
7406156 it would be foolish not to aspire to even greater heights especially as the host nation
7406157 sure weve got to see whether or not it is feasible to move to third place we havent made a decision on that
7406158 but this is not a national organising committee which is going to sit on its laurels and nor are the athletes we will want to make sure that we deliver the best for britain in 2012 so we are going to be looking to go higher
7406159 if you had asked me this two weeks ago i would have said impossible
7406160 the phrase we used was fourth in the medals is the best we can hope to achieve given a nation of our size
7406161 but we look at these games and what has happened to the russians if they are in reach then theres no reason to constrain our ambitions
7406162 in terms of 2012 nobody is going to be happy with the same again but we need to be bringing that to life probably through more medals
7406163 v yanse m s lejos no interrumpan sigan jugando pero sin armar alboroto
7406164 s llueve poco tan poco o casi nada tanto que la tierra adem s de estar reseca y achicada como cuero viejo se ha llenado de rajaduras y de esa cosa que all llama pasojos de agua que no son sino terrones endurecidos como piedras filosas que se clavan en los pies de uno al caminar como si all hasta a la tierra le hubieran crecido espinas como si as fuera
7406165 dicen los de all que cuando llena la luna ven de bulto la figura del viento recorriendo las calles de luvina llevando a rastras una cobija negra pero yo siempre lo que llegu a ver cuando hab a luna en luvina fue la imagen del desconsuelo siempre
7406166 pero t mese su cerveza veo que no le ha dado ni siquiera una probadita t mesela o tal vez no le guste as tibia como est y es que aqu no hay de otra yo s que as sabe mal que agarra un sabor como a meados de burro aqu uno se acostumbra a fe que all ni siquiera esto se consigue cuando vaya a luvina la extra ar all no podr probar sino un mezcal que ellos hacen con una yerba llamada hojas y que a los primeros tragos estar usted dando de volteretas como si lo chacamotearan mejor t mese su cerveza yo s lo que le digo
7406167 espera no vas a dejar sestear a tus animales est n muy aporreados
7406168 aqu se fregar an m s nos dijo mejor me vuelvo
7406169 y se fue dej ndose caer por la cuesta de la piedra cruda espoleando sus caballos como si se alejara de alg n lugar endemoniado
7406170 nosotros mi mujer y mis tres hijos nos quedamos all parados en la mitad de la plaza con todos nuestros ajuares en nuestros brazos en medio de aquel lugar en donde s lo se o a el viento
7406171 una plaza sola sin una sola yerba para detener el aire all nos quedamos
7406172 bueno si no te importa ve a buscar d nde comer y d nde pasar la noche aqu te
7406173 ella agarr al m s peque o de sus hijos y se fue pero no regres
7406174 al atardecer cuando el sol alumbraba s lo las puntas de los cerros fuimos a buscarla anduvimos por los callejones de luvina hasta que la encontramos metida en la iglesia sentada mero en medio de aquella iglesia solitaria con el ni o dormido entre sus piernas
7406175 all no hab a a qui n rezarle era un jacal n vac o sin puertas nada m s con unos
7406176 aquella noche nos acomodamos para dormir en un rinc n de la iglesia detr s del altar desmantelado
7406177 los ni os lloraban porque no los dejaba dormir el miedo y mi mujer tratando de retenerlos a todos entre sus brazos abrazando su manojo de hijos y yo all sin saber qu hacer
7406178 es el silencio du rmete descansa aunque sea un poquito que ya va a amanecer
7406179 las vi paradas frente a m mir ndome luego como si fueran sombras echaron a caminar calle abajo con sus negros c ntaros
7406180 no no se me olvidar jam s esa primera noche que pas en luvina
7406181 no cree que esto se merece otro trago aunque sea nom s para que se me quite el mal sabor del recuerdo
7406182 usted ha de pensar que le estoy dando vueltas a una misma idea y as es s se or
7406183 porque en luvina s lo viven los puros viejos y los que todav a no han nacido como quien dice
7406184 s lo quedan los puros viejos y las mujeres solas o con un marido que anda donde s lo dios sabe d nde
7406185 mientras tanto los viejos aguardan por ellos y por el d a de la muerte sentados en sus puertas con los brazos ca dos movidos s lo por esa gracia que es la gratitud del hijo solos en aquella soledad de luvina
7406186 un d a trat de convencerlos de que se fueran a otro lugar donde la tierra fuera buena v monos de aqu les dije no faltar modo de acomodarnos en alguna parte el gobierno nos ayudar
7406187 ellos me oyeron sin parpadear mir ndome desde el fondo de sus ojos de los que s lo se asomaba una lucecita all muy adentro
7406188 dices que el gobierno nos ayudar profesor t no conoces al gobierno
7406189 tambi n nosotros lo conocemos da esa casualidad de lo que no sabemos nada es de la madre de gobierno
7406190 yo les dije que era la patria ellos movieron la cabeza diciendo que no y se rieron
7406191 y tienen raz n sabe usted el se or ese s lo se acuerda de ellos cuando alguno de los muchachos ha hecho alguna fechor a ac abajo entonces manda por l hasta luvina y se lo matan de ah en m s no saben si existe
7406192 t nos quieres decir que dejemos luvina porque seg n t ya estuvo bueno de aguantar hambres sin necesidad me dijeron pero si nosotros nos vamos qui n se llevar a nuestros muertos ellos viven aqu y no podemos dejarlos solos
7406193 y all siguen usted los ver ahora que vaya mascando bagazos de mezquite seco y trag ndose su propia saliva los mirar pasar como sombras repegados al muro de las casas casi arrastrados por el viento
7406194 no oyen ese viento les acab por decir l acabar con ustedes
7406195 dura lo que debe de durar es el mandato de dios me contestaron malo cuando deja de hacer aire cuando eso sucede el sol se arrima mucho a luvina y nos chupa la sangre y la poca agua que tenemos en el pellejo el aire hace que el sol se est all arriba as es mejor
7406196 ya no volv a decir nada me sal de luvina y no he vuelto ni pienso regresar
7406197 pero mire las maromas que da el mundo usted va para all ahora dentro de pocas horas tal vez ya se cumplieron quince a os que me dijeron a m lo mismo usted va a ir a san juan luvina
7406198 qu opina usted si le pedimos a este se or que nos matice unos mezcalitos con la cerveza se levanta uno a cada rato y eso interrumpe mucho la pl tica oye camilo m ndanos ahora unos mezcales
7406199 my friend is your friend and your friend is my friend
7406200 its the olympics and im here for the usa i got a supercharge and took it from there it was unreal
7406201 the six fundamentals of success the rules for getting it right for yourself and your organization
7406202 what if i cant carry it what if i trip and fall
7406203 the standing hurt a little but it was all worth it i had tears in my eyes when the flame was lit
7406204 thats great now here is what else we should do
7406205 after the surgery our medical bills became even more unmanageable
7406206 we found ourselves buried by medical expenses and unable to keep up
7406207 part of the reason home prices are declining is a fundamental deterioration in the housing stock
7406208 during the boom nine out of 10 houses for sale in many markets were in prime condition now for every 10 houses at least three are dogs
7406209 an opportunity for senator clinton to see her delegates many for the first time since the primaries ended thank them for their hard work and support and most importantly to encourage them to support and work for senator obama as strongly as she has in order to elect him in november
7406210 we figured wed be fine if they said disperse wed disperse but we never got the chance
7406211 stop the torture stop the war thats what were fighting for
7406212 you cant compare new york which has buildings all around to denver that has open areas
7406213 we would be remiss if we didnt prepare for mass arrests
7406214 people would sit in buses waiting hours days to be processed if we didnt have this set up
7406215 we have a pamphlet called the constitution a lot of us have read it already
7406216 im not going to pretend im one of you because im not and neither is my opponent
7406217 i actually consider myself part of the agriculture community in north carolina
7406218 im not a johnny come lately to rural north carolina or to agriculture and agribusiness
7406219 national washington group and labor unions and other groups from throughout the country
7406220 the 30 second tv ads which now attack me by this washington labor group are saying that im opposed to free two year college tuition and therefore im against students im against kids
7406221 this has nothing to do with endorsements by quasi labor unions
7406222 my opponent says that childrens health care insurance sends the wrong signal
7406223 they know theyre going to get free medical care for their children
7406224 were sending the wrong signals by our government programs right now
7406225 i dont know where she got that quote from and i look forward to seeing it some day and im sure its out of context like many of the negative ads from national washington groups and labor unions
7406226 i in no way meant that i would want to take away health insurance from children
7406227 employees hours and work from home options are flexible in extenuating circumstances
7406228 for example when one staffers husband was sick she was encouraged to use a flexible schedule to balance family and work obligations and when another employee had a difficult pregnancy confining her to bed rest her home was set up so she could work remotely
7406229 hes got the passion to lift up middle class americans he hasnt forgotten his working class roots he has the expertise that will make him a great counselor on international crises that might come up
7406230 one of the greatest vice presidents in the history of the united states
7406231 has challenged the status quo and hes even criticized senator obama so its a tribute to senator obama that hes not just choosing a yes man but a person who will speak what he believes
7406232 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7406233 north carolina is a big state and its important that kay talk to voters from one end to the other
7406234 the closer you get to november the more the local democratic candidates are going to want to distance themselves
7406235 its indicative of what the conventions have become which is a place where not a lot of substantive business gets done but a place where party activists get to network
7406236 and people of that stature are already plugged into that
7406237 looking forward to campaigning with obama again this fall thats for sure
7406238 and she wants to spend her time getting her message out to as many voters as she can
7406239 it just so happens she had several events scheduled during the week of convention
7406240 i hope the delegates to the convention from north carolina have already made up their mind who theyre voting for governor
7406241 the only thing you could host that is bigger is the olympics
7406242 you do realize that it is for your eyes right
7406243 well how do you know it is ok to use on your hair
7406244 because if it is safe for my eyes the most sensitive part of my body then it is more than safe for my hair duh
7406245 im just saying cause you seem to have a problem with using products in the proper manner like taking off your makeup with toilet paper
7406246 i am so very resourceful in ways you have no idea
7406247 well when you had that bad rash on your arm and chest and i gave you some of that funky smelling white creme to stop the itch you never asked what it was
7406248 ill give you a hint it starts with an h
7406249 hey what does it matter what i used as long as it stopped the itch
7406250 i dont think that this will help stabilise the situation in the region
7406251 under the cover of needing to deliver humanitarian goods nato countries continue to boost their naval grouping
7406252 in addition to the spanish and german frigates that entered the black sea basin on august 21 yesterday a polish frigate and a destroyer of the us navy passed the bosphorous
7406253 i dont think that this will help stabilise the situation in the region
7406254 no withdrawal has been mentioned today the russians are keeping all their previous illegal checkpoints
7406255 but we are still scared how can we be sure there is not going to be another war the russian troops have only gone back 10 kilometres outside the city
7406256 no se trata de que sea un triunfo pol tico aunque sea por unanimidad si cuando se ejecute no satisface a los jubilados o no es una ley til
7406257 will be a powerful tool that leverages the eyes and ears of many toward the apprehension of criminals who threaten our protectors
7406258 families have been saying youve got to catch them quicker
7406259 this will be greatly appreciated i believe it will be a nationwide thing it will catch on
7406260 i dont think anyone will lose their heads but were going to figure out what happened were going to straighten this out
7406261 i played the game i dearly loved to play since i was kid
7406262 they gave me a number and now its hanging from the rafters
7406263 the sharjah show on august 21 was successful we are now planning a series of their saifeenas shows across europe and the middle east the show had a big turnout kareena and saif are a good looking star couple whom people want to see on stage together they have become hugely popular in dubai and europe because of race and jab we met though they didnt end up performing together they are very keen to do something together
7406264 we had a great show saif is in talks with the moranis to plan it for other destinations we had a crowd of over 20 000 people which was extremely heart warming
7406265 an opportunity for senator clinton to see her delegates many for the first time since the primaries ended and most importantly to encourage them to support and work for senator obama as strongly as she has in order to elect him in november
7406266 it seemed that only people of asian background were responsible for this type of crime but as i delved into it i discovered that it was a global problem its not just hindus sikhs or muslims
7406267 maybe you really are the keeper of the gates of hell
7406268 st anger was the low point of the roller coaster but were back at the top now
7406269 our relationship is part of what makes metallica special if everything goes smooth all the time then something is wrong you have to have friction as it creates energy brainstorms pro activity and we go forward
7406270 we wanted to play much better to open up the stadium but it didnt happen they outplayed us tonight
7406271 offensively we didnt have a lot of rhythm but we didnt have the ball a lot
7406272 in the second half we had a chance to get back in it but the turnovers really took the wind out of our sails
7406273 he handled the information we got in and out it was a noisy game and it could have been noisier but we got off to that good start
7406274 the touchdown was a plus but it could have been a whole lot better
7406275 weve got to get back to protecting the ball like the colts normally do
7406276 i told the team after the game that this was kind of a normal nfl game
7406277 if you could keep from turning the ball over and can win the turnover battle youll have a real good chance of winning the game thats what happened
7406278 quite frankly im going to have to make a judgment in the next little while as to whether or not this parliament can function productively
7406279 never be bullied into silence never allow yourself to be made a victim accept no ones definition of your life define yourself
7406280 with so many students and families relying on the college rankings for their higher education research were always working to find new ways to demystify the college search
7406281 this year weve included new ranking categories and editorial content that address the most relevant issues to prospective students weve also developed an interactive student center on usnews com which allows students and parents to research their college options through videos school discussion forums and expert advice columns
7406282 make sure you are covered for any accident that could put you and yours in the poor house raise your limits on all the coverage you can afford and lower your premiums by raising your deductibles if your car is older why carry a low deductible on comprehensive insurance which pays for fire wind hail and glass breakage
7406283 carriers also look at your age driving record and the make and model of your car where you live plays an important role in determining premium if you live in a nice neighborhood there generally is less congestion which means fewer accidents and probably not as many thefts most carriers want a three year history of how many tickets you have had and the accidents you have been in as part of the premium equation the kind of work you do also factors into the premium equation do boring safe work and you will pay lower premiums
7406284 finally a high credit score can lower your premiums carriers believe the more responsible you are about staying current on your bills will translate into responsible driving
7406285 always keep a disposable camera in your glove compartment if you are in an accident make sure you take photos before any vehicles are moved minutes after the accident the story will change so make sure you have pictures
7406286 isnt there some kind of day where you bring the books back and they you know forgive you

7406297 we cant make torchwood toys we cant market to children because its an adult show maybe we could do torchwood sex toys i will suggest it

7406299 while trekkers have had a number of big screen delights who fans are hoping that the success of the new incarnation of doctor who will see it make the jump to a cinema near them
7406300 im not against it i dont think its the most important thing for doctor who
7406301 a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show if it gets in the way of the show thats appalling
7406302 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic
7406303 its a practical issue this is a show thats hard for even the young super fit david tennant to keep up with it might kill someone over 60
7406304 we have provided daleks and components for the tardis in the past and i think a one off move to the big screen would be amazing
7406305 it would take doctor who to the next level the show has a worldwide appeal so should be very successful
7406306 i think david tenant is an excellent doctor who is perfect for the part because he is eccentric and a nice guy too
7406307 earlier the casualty ward received between 100 to 150 patients only today the number has increased to 800 the challenge is greater but resources insufficient
7406308 i had always been passionate about giving something back to my society which is why i chose to do medicine when i joined as a medical officer in 1989 and witnessed the poor condition of state run hospitals i decided to work towards a change i wanted to uplift the ward i was given charge of and prove that the government sector can also deliver if provided with the funds and opportunity this i was able to do over the years
7406309 the emergency ward at the jpmc karachi is possibly the only ward in the country where doctors are constantly busy if there is no political clash or bomb blast we are dealing with deaths from epidemics rain and what not
7406310 there were about 250 injured brought to the hospital and the chaos was unimaginable
7406311 in an urban city like karachi where suicide bombings clashes and political killings are common it is difficult to remain stress free but with time we learnt to handle one difficult situation after another
7406312 my official timings are from 8 00 am to 2 00 pm but i never return home on time and am unable to have lunch with my children it would always take me another three hours to wrap up
7406313 i am convinced that it is possible that some people have lived before as aliens one other possibility is that these memories have been implanted in order to program us to prepare for life off this planet
7406314 these recollections are vivid and powerful and i believe that these people are being sincere when they say these were their past lives i have one woman who feels very angry she feels she has been trapped here on earth and she just wants to get off the planet and return home
7406315 the world would be a poorer place without doctor who
7406316 that bore in the pub who delivers the punchline of a joke a second before it is delivered
7406317 for doctor who to turn into an old man youd be pissed off
7406318 even william hartnell had trouble back then he was often ill and he forgot his lines i think the doctor will always be about 40

7406332 as a nation we now look forward to holding the olympic games in london in 2012
7406333 the golden triumphs of the present british team can only serve as further inspiration to those who will be working hard over the next four years to make the london games a shining example of olympic success
7406334 the handover was marked with a quirky eight minute cameo of the capital that smacked more of the swinging sixties than of the 21st century cosmopolis that will stage the next games
7406335 if this is a statement of intent from the 2012 organisers that they will not try to match beijing in scale or spectacle but will instead rely on flair and wit it is commendable
7406336 as an emerging superpower china felt it had something to prove london should in keeping with our nations character be a little more understated

7406340 this book is an excellent learning tool like any other tool you get out of it exactly what you put in my advice is to spend as much time with each section as you need if you do that you will walk away with every bit of the knowledge an industry thought leader can provide

7406361 who will be the new vice president whoever you want thats who
7406362 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore
7406363 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7406364 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7406365 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7406366 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7406367 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7406368 obamas shortlist has narrowed to a handful of names and president clintons former no 2 isnt one of them
7406369 could donna come back well in science fiction anything is possible
7406370 i knew that there would definitely be an end to donna at the end of the series
7406371 but had that not been the case had it been open ended had there been potential for donna to stay for another series i must confess that id have said yes like a shot
7406372 could donna come back well in science fiction anything is possible
7406373 this is going to be catastrophic for millions of people
7406374 the point is that if you dont put the big rocks in first you wont get them in
7406375 recently a client wanted to have her father co sign for her first car
7406376 and the bank said no because he had signed on the car loans of two other children his score was 720 the other children were making the payments perfectly and his debt to income was in line the bank said no too many cars
7406377 no i mean the guy dad used to go to
7406378 i really love that movie the one with the alien
7406379 no i love alien at least i love nicole kidman
7406380 nicole kidman wasnt in an alien movie she was in a robot move
7406381 yeah nicole kidman was great in that alien movie staring that english guy from
7406382 oh my lord i am not eloquent either in the past or since you have spoken to your servant but i am slow of speech and of tongue
7406383 youre right to be upset but to put up such an arrogant waa waa post seems to me like someone is forgetting they arent the center of the universe
7406384 andy andy andy tacky tacky tacky i adore your site but this is the first post i have ever seen from you which is a clear abuse of your position at the helm of widely read resource
7406385 sorry andy but no sympathy from me whatsoever get a grip dude and stop whining
7406386 sorry for your loss but this blog is an important news source for many gay people you should wear that mantle with pride and not compromise your journalistic integrity by dealing with a personal issue by leveraging your readership it is an injustice to the quality of this blog very joemygod but not up to towleroad standards
7406387 nuns are above all women and beauty is a gift from god priest antonio rungi of the southern italian diocese of modragone told the daily corriere della sera
7406388 this contest will be a way to show there isnt just the beauty we see on television but also a more discrete charm he said
7406389 you really think all nuns are old stunted and sad this isnt the case any more thanks to the arrival in our country of young and vital nuns notably from africa and latin america
7406390 ive already told you once you cant hand out those balloons its an offence
7406391 the thr33 ringz concept is cause the industry is just like a circus
7406392 you got the strong men tattooed dudes bearded ladies elephants tigers all kinds of dumb crap
7406393 im not just saying that its really on the charts i got 11 number ones in one year in the history of time the beatles got 13 so if i woulda got two more in that year i woulda beat the beatles thats why im the ringleader
7406394 if you steal the t pain effect or you try to do a t pain song you re just singing karaoke
7406395 its non stop so i cant address somebody specifically everybody knows who they are it makes no sense to call names if you feel guilty then you feel guilty
7406396 i get all my top hats custom made in london so unless you know my people that do that you aint gon never see none like mine
7406397 i got too many of em already even for you to catch up
7406398 i have a lot of outfits i need to match up
7406399 if i go buy a kid robot outfit ill send that to my stylist and shell send that to london and have a kid robot hat made thats how consistent we keep it
7406400 i just cant wear em in convertibles theyll fly off i had to find that out the hard way
7406401 look directly out the front window and take a look at whats walking in front of our driveway
7406402 see i put a drop of blank dont know what she said in the clear glaze to take away some of that ashy tone and make it warmer
7406403 and how much is this fauxpas going to cost me including the three months i have to live with it until i come back and have my hair done again
7406404 barrington high school is less than a quarter mile away from ej amp e tracks
7406405 any student who is walking across those tracks every day were not only worrying about them getting hit but standing out there in the cold for extended periods of time
7406406 pretty much anywhere our buses go theyre crossing the tracks
7406407 would have an impact on our ability to get our buses to and from school
7406408 my frustration is they led us to believe they would finish this development
7406409 but suddenly they came out and bulldozed five houses that were started the foundations are just a pile of rocks now i know they filed for chapter 11 but theyre still in business we werent told they were ceasing construction here at the same time theyre opening other developments
7406410 when we moved in there was a school planned and a community pool and a workout facility but we dont have them but there are three ponds and they did a beautiful job of tying in the open spaces with the natural landscape were not panicking we realize a home is a long term investment
7406411 we wanted to keep the residents up to date on whats happening
7406412 their main concern is having the trash removed they also dont want to see another developer come in and build just anything we assured them that wouldnt happen
7406413 but theres a fine line between working with kimball hill on maintaining the property and complicating the issues
7406414 were hopeful that a developer will come in when the market turns around
7406415 maybe by the time they have the school built well be grandparents
7406416 this can help in some ways by adding a little drama to days that otherwise would not have much drama to them and it might attract more viewers to watch the convention
7406417 of course if viewers are attracted and then theres a catastrophe of some sort that would not be good news for obama
7406418 shes likely to play her part but its her die hard supporters on the floor thatll be hard to control if it all breaks down then they might as well kiss the election goodbye
7406419 i have no problem with the decision to do this
7406420 they deserve a lot of respect theres no reason to squelch other peoples opinions and then everyone should feel that theyve been treated fairly
7406421 i think that a lot of clinton activists including women are going to move to obama i find it hard to believe theyre going to vote for mccain
7406422 both the inspector and the actual construction company neither of them did their jobs correctly
7406423 consequently now we are in a situation where our kids have been put in harms way since the day the door opened in 2003
7406424 i think for the amount of money that the taxpayers are putting out the inspection process by the regional board is abysmally inadequate
7406425 so you need to have a process whereby somebody is assisting the districts
7406426 we have encouraged all of our school districts to hire this third party person who will be on the job every day while the building is being built
7406427 it isnt that we do solely the inspection by ourselves i dont think you can blame any one source for this happening
7406428 if people do what they are supposed to do then there arent problems and there are safeguards in place
7406429 the safeguards failed until fault is determined we cannot comment on what we know or dont know about the construction and inspection process because thats a subject of ongoing litigation
7406430 the community is right to be angry about it and the lawsuit will determine where the fault is going to lie
7406431 when there are problems with a project the advantage in that situation is you only have to go back to the general contractor to determine liability versus having to figure out which subcontractors are liable
7406432 marketers are at a crossroads with the data industry which is in the business of selling volume and not capable of mining the important data that customers actually need
7406433 we see businesses moving toward much finer targeting and away from a blast mentality demandbases solutions are designed to deliver a superior online experience while generating better top and bottom line results
7406434 we have brilliant mathematicians and programmers we are very strong on data analysis and have developed better technology which is cutting edge in russia we are constantly inventing new programs to stay ahead
7406435 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7406436 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7406437 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7406438 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7406439 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7406440 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7406441 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7406442 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7406443 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7406444 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7406445 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7406446 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7406447 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7406448 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7406449 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7406450 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
7406451 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
7406452 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7406453 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman

7406457 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7406458 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7406459 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7406460 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7406461 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7406462 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7406463 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7406464 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7406465 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7406466 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7406467 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7406468 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7406469 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7406470 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7406471 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7406472 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7406473 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7406474 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7406475 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7406476 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7406477 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7406478 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7406479 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7406480 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7406481 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7406482 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7406483 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7406484 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7406485 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7406486 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7406487 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7406488 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7406489 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7406490 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7406491 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7406492 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7406493 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7406494 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7406495 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7406496 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7406497 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7406498 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7406499 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7406500 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7406501 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
7406502 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
7406503 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
7406504 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
7406505 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
7406506 i have decided to raise no objections under australias foreign investment policy
7406507 to the extent the proposed acquisition lessens the competition in the global seaborne supply of iron ore it would be likely to have the effect of increasing global iron ore prices which would in turn increase prices paid by steelmakers in australia

7406532 okay so it goes like this word clutter endless thankless pitiful days are planted and ready and we are a new winter already but blip clang zap go machines at night and most of the time i am not as much sad as i am just well ready and nothing goes as fast as this whatever this is this which comes with blurheart and repeat fizzle studders this which holds me to the pen and words guide the fastening of a bushel of new days plus dreams
7406533 our top priority is restoration of the judges and we want it done on monday
7406534 the alliance is intact today but its future depends on the fulfilment of the promise zardari made for the restoration of the judges
7406535 i hit a 3 pointer to cut the gap to three points and then we both traded baskets to leave us down three points with less than 20 seconds remaining our coach ran a set play for me and i hit a trey at the buzzer to force overtime it was a crazy game
7406536 it was just really beneficial for me to get back on the court playing real games
7406537 we played against poland twice already we lost the first game but won the second one i was 4 for 5 from 3 point range in the first game and went 2 for 3 from 3 point range in the second game we play austria next
7406538 playing in the european championship helped me out a lot
7406539 but the games with the a2 team are really helping me it is great competition and i get a chance to play against the best players in europe
7406540 glen was a great friend and he gave me a chance to get into college coaching
7406541 he had an outstanding basketball mind and was well respected by the other big eight coaches
7406542 andy was real close to a couple of guys back in new york city
7406543 he would go there in the summer and watch all of the aau tournaments he had a knack of finding a lot of hidden talent he was responsible for bringing in a lot of great players from new york but we had a couple of near misses too he got a little known new yorker named julius erving to pick iowa state as one of his three campus visits
7406544 claire is an outstanding athlete that will give us depth on the perimeter
7406545 her international experience will help her adjust to the college game it has been great having aus alison lacey here both on and off the court now we will hopefully have some irish luck
7406546 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7406547 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7406548 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7406549 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7406550 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7406551 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
7406552 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
7406553 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7406554 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7406555 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7406556 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7406557 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7406558 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7406559 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7406560 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7406561 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7406562 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7406563 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7406564 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7406565 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7406566 if the u s dollar is rising commodities take a hit its been a huge factor
7406567 we may see this rally in the u s dollar continue in the short term but you have to differentiate between speculation and the underlying demand for commodities
7406568 the majority of the increase in commodities over the last five years has been driven by demand from china and the emerging economies being so great that supplies havent been able to keep up
7406569 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7406570 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7406571 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
7406572 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7406573 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7406574 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7406575 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
7406576 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
7406577 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
7406578 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
7406579 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
7406580 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
7406581 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
7406582 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
7406583 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
7406584 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
7406585 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
7406586 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
7406587 and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7406588 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
7406589 however nothing rallies the righties like a clinton a recent poll showed 49 of americans would never vote for hillary
7406590 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
7406591 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government

7406598 we have been actively engaged in this since the news of this kidnapping occurred
7406599 we have deployed additional staff from our mission in pretoria to our high commission in nairobi which is handling this case at a consular level
7406600 the dfat consular officials are providing consular assistance to the family in australia which have asked im simply referring to their request have asked the media to respect their privacy at this difficult time

7406606 because they ended up in a zone of high risk with unstable ice pillars which have a high risk of collapse at the most we might be able to survey the area to see whether some signs of the presence of the bodies have emerged the only certain thing is that these people are beyond hope of being rescued
7406607 they were not hit by the avalanche they are alive and unhurt
7406608 a wall of ice coming towards us and then we were carried 200 metres
7406609 its probable according to statements made to us that groups of climbers roped together were on the path up the mountain as well as in the place where the block of ice tumbled down

7406722 the income derived from the units at todays prices is attractive
7406723 its our view that the heavily discounted price will reverse in due course as the benefits of the diversification strategy of the trust are better recognised
7406724 this means that further rental growth will be available in the year ahead in the year to date rental reviews have resulted in an increase to the trusts income of over 1m
7406725 many commentators have observed the potential for property values to ease over the year ahead and clearly in times of economic change this cannot be ruled out
7406726 however rental growth within the property portfolio already evident since year end provides at least a partial buffer to this pressure
7406727 indeed we have recently negotiated conditional agreements to sell assets in excess of 60m at or around book value as at march 31
7406728 obviously theres a couple of teams that are top that have dominated the competition for the last 18 months
7406729 we give ourselves every chance and as long as we prepare right well take it as it comes
7406730 we probably havent put a full game together which weve been really happy with but theres definitely three quarters or half a game which is how wed like to play our football
7406731 and i think weve been putting some good scores on the board and also stopping the opposition so if we can do that for four quarters well give ourselves every chance to be successful
7406732 we were obviously a little up and down towards the start of the year and i think with two breaks this year weve come back pretty well and won seven of our last nine games
7406733 so its definitely positive and hopefully weve got a little bit more improvement in us
7406734 i dont know a lot about our position and what we need to happen but i think we need a few teams to lose and for us to have a pretty comfortable win
7406735 were in no position to take any week for granted
7406736 this weeks obviously nice and we know where we are but weve still got a big game ahead of us
7406737 indeed the day after his passing we learned that yadav was to attend the melbourne aquarium on a school excursion
7406738 it therefore appears that tragic circumstances on a cold and wet night conspired to claim yadavs life
7406739 we must hope the story of yadavs brief life eagerness to learn and tragic passing proves as a parable to all people that they should take the time in their hectic lives to thank the good health of their beautiful children and families

7406805 i think were fortunate to have michelle obama as our potential first lady
7406806 she is truly aware of all the issues that face our country she is someone that the average person can relate to
7406807 im sure she can bake cookies and has baked cookies for her family but im sure her family didnt prepare her for harvard law school not to deal with the social and political issues of the day

7406817 pocas personas de nuestra generaci n han encarnado con tanta transparencia el rostro manso y humilde de jesucristo
7406818 el hermano roger ha seguido el camino del cordero con su dulzura y su humildad con su rechazo de todo acto de grandeza con su decisi n de no hablar mal de nadie con su deseo de llevar en su coraz n los dolores y las esperanzas de la humanidad
7406819 en una poca turbulenta para la iglesia y para la fe cristiana el hermano roger era una fuente de esperanza reconocida por muchos incluido yo mismo ve a c mo aquella estancia les ayudaba a conocer mejor y a vivir la palabra de dios en la alegr a y la simplicidad
7406820 m s que a la rapidez del desarrollo del movimiento ecum nico l miraba a su profundidad
7406821 estaba convencido de que s lo un ecumenismo nutrido de la palabra de dios y de la celebraci n de la eucarist a de la oraci n y de la contemplaci n ser a capaz de reunir a los cristianos en la unidad querida por jes s
7406822 como un hilo conductor incluso en las decisiones m s concretas de cada d a acogiendo alegremente cada acci n que pueda acercar a los cristianos de tradiciones diferentes evitando toda palabra o gesto que pudiera retrasar su reconciliaci n
7406823 para m explic el purpurado el hecho de que cada a o miles de j venes sigan tomando el camino de la peque a colina de taiz es verdaderamente un don del esp ritu santo para la iglesia hoy
7406824 estoy contento de ver que los j venes que plantan cada verano las tiendas de taiz procedentes de diversos pa ses de europa occidental y oriental pertenecen a comunidades de tradici n protestante cat lica y ortodoxa y que a menudo acuden acompa ados por sus sacerdotes o pastores
7406825 como una par bola de la unidad que ayuda a superar las fracturas del pasado creo que muchos j venes se dan cuenta de lo que se juega con la unidad de los cristianos saben c mo el peso de las divisiones dificulta el testimonio de los cristianos y la construcci n de una nueva sociedad
7406826 encuentran dificultades para acompa ar bien a los j venes en su camino espiritual y en este sentido los grandes encuentros de taiz responden a una verdadera necesidad pastoral
7406827 gran continuidad en la vida de la comunidad de taiz y en la acogida a los j venes
7406828 la liturgia la oraci n y la hospitalidad contin an con el mismo esp ritu como un canto que nunca se ha interrumpido esto dice mucho no s lo sobre la persona del nuevo prior sino tambi n sobre la madurez humana y espiritual de toda la comunidad de taiz es la comunidad en su conjunto la que ha heredado el carisma del hermano roger y del cual continua a vivir e irradiar
7406829 ya desde joven nutri su fe y su vida espiritual en las fuentes de otras tradiciones cristianas traspasando as ciertos l mites confesionales su deseo de seguir una vocaci n mon stica y con esta intenci n de fundar una nueva comunidad con cristianos reformados dice mucho sobre esta b squeda
7406830 la fe del prior de taiz se enriqueci con el patrimonio de la fe de la iglesia cat lica
7406831 recibi en muchas ocasiones la comuni n de manos de juan pablo ii que ten a lazos de amistad con l desde los tiempos del concilio vaticano ii y que conoc a bien su camino en la fe cat lica en este sentido no hab a nada de secreto o de escondido en la postura de la iglesia cat lica ni en taiz ni en roma
7406832 reconciliando en s mismo la fe de sus or genes con el misterio de la fe cat lica sin romper la comuni n con nadie
7406833 en su conciencia l hab a entrado en el misterio de la fe cat lica como uno que crece sin tener que abandonar o romper con lo que hab a recibido o vivido antes
7406834 por respeto al camino de fe del prior de taiz ser a preferible no aplicar en su caso categor as que l juzgaba inapropiadas para su experiencia y que por otro lado la iglesia cat lica nunca quiso imponerle
7406835 por una parte el prior de taiz se sent a muy cercano a los obispos de roma en su preocupaci n de conducir a la iglesia de cristo en el camino de la renovaci n espiritual de la unidad de los cristianos del servicio a los pobres y del testimonio del evangelio
7406836 se sab a profundamente comprendido y apoyado por los papas en su personal camino espiritual y en la orientaci n que iba tomando la joven comunidad de taiz
7406837 la conciencia de actuar en armon a con el pensamiento del obispo de roma era para l como una br jula en todos sus actos l nunca habr a tomado una iniciativa que supiera que iba contra el parecer o la voluntad del papa
7406838 la iglesia quiere participar en su formulaci n y no perder derechos adquiridos
7406839 preocupa a los obispos quedar al margen de este debate por lo que reiteran que la iglesia quiere participar en su formulaci n y no perder derechos adquiridos
7406840 la iglesia valora positivamente la intenci n del poder ejecutivo de modificar la ley
7406841 muy importante que ella otros credos y organizaciones comunitarias tengan presencia en el espectro de la radio y la televisi n
7406842 la iglesia espera que se respeten sus derechos adquiridos entre ellos poder seguir manteniendo las emisoras de radio y televisi n que ya tiene y pide que tambi n se respete su trabajo pastoral en los medios

7406895 aggressive management of this infectious disease is feasible and can prevent high mortality rates and further transmission of drug resistant strains of tb

7406900 solid financial planning prudent campaign spending and the support of over 1000 donors give me a strong overall advantage
7406901 as the long time incumbent and member of the committee that writes the state budget it is no surprise that senator darling out raised me in big money and special interest donations she talks about being a fiscal conservative but has squandered her campaign resources the only thing i can be accused of overspending on is shoe leather ive worn through eight pairs since i first began going door to door and meeting with people in the 8th senate district over a year ago
7406902 my opponent likes to tell people she is out knocking on doors but the voters know the difference between riding in a car watching staff drop off taxpayer funded road maps that people did not even ask for and actually knocking on doors and talking to people

7406906 i want to be a teacher when i grow up just like you
7406907 the real problem is not too few teachers entering the profession it is too many leaving
7406908 the kids were wonderful to be with but the stress of everything that went with it and the low pay did not make it hard to leave
7406909 its sad because you see a lot of the teachers that are young and gung ho are ready to leave
7406910 sabrina walasek loved teaching middle school science and math in daly city and felton near santa cruz but after six years the oakland resident found herself worn out from keeping kids in check the amount of energy spent on discipline and behavior management just got to me after a while
7406911 according to a national center for education statistics nces survey of 8 400 public and private school teachers the main reasons for high teacher turnover and attrition rates are inadequate administrative support 38 percent and workplace conditions 32 percent
7406912 the standardized tests dont affect the students grades but for administrators the results can destroy careers
7406913 according to the national commission on teaching and americas future 2 million teachers will leave their jobs within the next decade

7406916 the program asks restaurants to submit their wine lists and menus and charges for the evaluation many restaurants proudly crow about their results though two thirds of all submissions win an award but evaluations are done on the wine selections rather than through in person visits and focus on the lists not necessarily overall service the program remains a major income source for the magazines publisher m shanken communications at 250 apiece the 4 128 restaurants in the 2008 list would have grossed more than 1 million total
7406917 the main wine list i submitted was a perfectly decent selection from around italy that met the magazines basic criteria about 250 wines including whites reds and sparkling wines some of which scored well in ws however osteria lintrepidos high priced reserve wine list was largely chosen from among some of the lowest scoring italian wines in wine spectator over the past few decades while its interesting that the reserve list would receive such seemingly little scrutiny the central point is that the wine cellar doesnt actually exist and while osteria lintrepido may be the first to win an award of excellence for an imaginary restaurant its unlikely that it was the first submission that didnt accurately reflect the contents of a restaurants wine cellar
7406918 these restaurants are not inspected every year montrachet which has kept the grand award since 1994 has not been reinspected since galileo an italian restaurant in washington that advertises its grand award on its on hold phone message won the honor in 1998 it was reinspected in 2000 but rotisserie for beef and bird in houston which has had a grand award since 1988 has never been reinspected

7406951 you know who i hope obama picks as his vp al gore
7406952 it was clear this election was going to be about change
7406953 people were ready to turn the page for a new approach to politics
7406954 i think it gave senator obama great credibility early on in the community of heavyweight fundraisers and political activists
7406955 hillary got the top three tiers of people in terms of staff and members of congress and surrogates
7406956 edwards got the fourth tier barack got the fifth tier with a couple of notable exceptions wexler was that exception
7406957 i was convinced then and im even more convinced now that senator obamas staunch support for israel and his compelling case to directly engage in diplomacy with iran for the purpose of thwarting irans nuclear ambition and stopping their financial support for terror was the most pro israel position that a presidential candidate could take
7406958 theyre a seal of good housekeeping as far as chicago jews are concerned with baracks bona fides
7406959 when he was running for congress and later on for the senate i would help organize fundraisers for him on the north shore which had been my congressional district and along the lakefront in chicago a lot of people who came to those were jewish
7406960 its a part of the yiddishkheit we grew up with to be a liberal
7406961 i was fascinated from the first time i saw him with jewish constituents at how easily they got along with him how much they liked him and were drawn to him and how well he answered questions particularly on israel

7406968 and if you look around in the park there are so many models and so many eras but theyre all airstreams and no one can tell them apart except for airstreamers as to their age or anything like that
7406969 there are some people in here who are so knowledgeable about airstreams
7406970 weve had a lot of different trailers but we will never have any other kind than an airstream again
7406971 theyre a bit of an icon theyre listed as one of the 99 things that america makes best and they are when you get into them and study them and read about them you realize that

7406996 the challenge is to avoid anything that smacks of angry black woman and get her back into the kitchen the question is whether she is willing to go along with that

7407017 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7407018 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7407019 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day

7407040 it is not a question of having technology or not having technology but rather what role it is allowed to play in human activities
7407041 the first to grow up surrounded by digital media computers are everywhere in the home school factory and office as are digital technologies cameras video games and cd roms todays kids are so bathed in bits that they think technology is part of the natural landscape
7407042 if we teach today as we taught yesterday we rob our children of tomorrow
7407043 computers are placed on small carts or desks with wheels so they can be moved to the area of need one strategy is to set up different workstations for students to use when working on a project access to a computer with an internet connection or cd rom capabilities may be one workstation and other resources can be available at other workstations students can rotate from one workstation to the next another strategy is for students who are using the computer to gather material they can print out the material and read it at a later time instead of trying to read it online
7407044 the carnegie commission on higher education concluded that technology should be the servant and not the master of instruction
7407045 due to the ever changing nature of technology effective teachers must realize that planning creating and modification of lesson plans and activities is a continuous process
7407046 inappropriately used in the classroom technology can be used to perpetuate old models of teaching and learning
7407047 learning does not take place better or faster simply by replacing one instructional medium with another
7407048 the shift of school from place to activity is a necessary transformation if our educational institutions are to be relevant in the lives of learners
7407049 research indicates that a childs success in school is significantly influenced by having a high degree of parental involvement
7407050 virtual schools are growing so quickly that a good count of them remains elusive
7407051 digital revolution w e are on the threshold of the most radical change in american education in over a century here with the web is the way for america to use the marvels it created to end the regression in our competitive and academic performance
7407052 legislature passed senate bill no 975 authorizing the texas education agency to invite interested schools to submit an application to join the virtual school pilot program aimed at benefiting at risk students
7407053 a strength of the southwest preparatory application was our schools strong history of working with at risk students
7407054 not make the kid fit the system but the system fit the kid
7407055 read background material engage in discussions with other students take test ask questions of his teacher and hands in assignments
7407056 the olo student body consists of a mix of kids who have turned to elearning for a variety of reasons
7407057 for a student to be successful in the virtual school system they have to be highly motivated self starting intelligent people
7407058 the virtual schools that are in wisconsin do a good job of marketing their product
7407059 there are pros and cons to any system the cons to virtual schools is we teach kids life skills as part of a curriculum im not sure you can get that sitting in front of a computer
7407060 core curriculum is based on wisconsins approved high school curriculum the core courses of english math science social studies and physical education meet the requirements of wisconsins department of public instruction
7407061 the wisconsin education association council thinks parents are taking the place of teachers in virtual schools a violation of state law that requires all public school teachers to have a valid teaching license
7407062 we cannot assume that our schools will naturally drift toward using technology effectively we must commit to staying the course and making the changes necessary to reach our goals of educating every child together we can use technology to ensure that no child is left behind

7407070 making information as socially important and highly publicised as the grocerychoice website and the green paper on carbon emissions trading inaccessible to a significant sector of the population is put bluntly a disgrace

7407078 a high percentage of muslims who attend that mosque are like all of us good americans hardworking honest kind the kind we all want to associate with but i think the majority is intimidated by a minority and i think theyre put in place to take control of these mosques and the reason for that is they want to institute in this country sharia law

7407092 i think virginia brown did the right thing by writing how she felt it lets other people know that they can be honest with their feelings and that they dont have to write nice lies because someone is no longer with us it could help some people see that maybe they need to get their act together now maybe the family like the woman said can move past this and come together
7407093 i too was raised by one of the most unkind human beings to ever walk the earth she like dolores aguilar had a wonderful husband who did not outlive her while most reading that obituary would wonder why a person would write such a thing i can answer that it was the only thing the daughter could do
7407094 i dislike the dishonesty and twisting of the truth that sometimes takes place after someone dies i refer to this as instant sainthood the obituary that ms brown wrote for her mother was inspiring and refreshingly honest i dont advocate that every death notice take the approach that she did but im glad theres an option for families who have someone like dolores aguilar in their lives in my opinion its not an obituary that tarnishes the wasted persons life but rather the day to day life she lived speaking the truth about her may help her descendants begin to heal and undo her legacy of cruelty
7407095 the brown obituary was by far the most classless and tasteless one ever im quite sure ms brown doesnt feel compelled to tell the truth in all ways nor should she bashing other people especially ones mother does not set you free i feel sorry for ms brown because she is hurt and wounded and death does not erase that kind of pain perhaps the obit was therapeutic for her and a good starting point to finally work through her anger and sadness
7407096 it takes some guts or a desperate need to purge and get the last word in to write something like that but damn if she wasnt being honest you make a good point though apparently we are becoming more and more accustomed more comfortable letting someone else take care of the simple things in our lives to the point where even a simple handwritten note that explains the life of someone is not a priority but a bill that needs to be paid on time hopefully others will think twice before they open a menu and choose the best obit for the best price
7407097 when i first read this column i laughed i thought it was a joke then i realized what a sad sad story it really is its too bad someone didnt get help for this woman who beat her children which would mean getting much needed help for the children it says the father was a good man did he do anything to stop the childrens abuse i dont mean to blame anyone else for this tragic life but cant help wonder if the childrens pain could have been lessened to think that it started out making me laugh
7407098 billy joel said it succinctly years ago honesty is such a lonely word everyone is so untrue to say the truth about a recently deceased relative who left a trail of abuse neglect and permanent scars on friends and family violates a basic taboo speaking ill of the dead but what about the surviving victims of the dead persons offenses do they not deserve a chance to expiate their devils by telling it like it was and is it hurts to face the wounds but it also heals thank you virginia brown
7407099 the story on dolores aguilar made me sad my mother could almost be her sister my mother was verbally and physically abusive she seldom had or has a nice thing to say to us or others it is sad because my mother is now 87 sick and frail i wonder how we will handle her obituary i dont think i could be as honest as mrs aguilars daughter but i truly admire her honesty
7407100 virginia brown had every right to say what she feels only her and her siblings know what they encountered as children because of their mother and only they know what they still continue to endure on a daily basis because of her its sad but true not all mothers and fathers have done great memorable things for their families the obituary was written with all honesty and will give virginia a sense of relief i hope that she and her siblings are able to come together now and be a family and are able to help each other with the pain that they have dealt with for so many years
7407101 i feel for the surviving family although im of the opinion that it should not have been written at all i too have a mother for whom none of the hallmark cards written ever fit when my mother dies if i write an obit at all it will probably be a bare bones timeline and there will be no funeral or memorial i used to say that my mother looked at the world through me colored lenses i too wish id had a nicer more loving mother but i didnt get one i feel for virginia brown and her siblings and hope they can manage to not pass on the legacy of ugly behavior that was modeled for them
7407102 brava virginia brown thats all i can say about the obituary she wrote regarding her mother obviously an evil woman beloved by none
7407103 i had to find sad humor in this obituary because i also had a mentally ill mother and it was a blessing and relief when she died as it stated i miss what i didnt have and am glad she is no longer tormented with the demons that ran her life and impacted mine i think it was well written honest and to the point
7407104 i hardly know where to start i had one of those mothers when she died i didnt have the courage to do something like that to this day i regret not getting it off my chest so my hats off to ms brown
7407105 there are more people with yet to be diagnosed or invented mental illnesses than doctors willing to perform worthless operations while it seems that undiagnosed mental illness continues to claim more aguilar family members i cant help but wonder why more families dont celebrate the passing of such oppressed individuals with a good public bashing i suppose most people have huge egos and want all their friends to read how wonderful their parents were or perhaps they have done nothing but blame others for their personal failures and simply take advantage of their parents silence
7407106 at least someone out there has the guts to be honest im not one to sugarcoat things at all a couple of years ago a co worker died there were many teary eyes until i asked if anyone knew where he lived did he have a family what was his favorite food and what was his last name for crying out loud nobody could answer but i was told that i was being insensitive i just wish there was more honesty
7407107 it is encouraging that so many people in the south west have gone smoke free in the past year
7407108 indeed the day after his passing we learned that yadav was to attend the melbourne aquarium on a school excursion
7407109 it therefore appears that tragic circumstances on a cold and wet night conspired to claim yadavs life
7407110 we must hope the story of yadavs brief life eagerness to learn and tragic passing proves as a parable to all people that they should take the time in their hectic lives to thank the good health of their beautiful children and families

7407191 h uman activity affecting the atmosphere is very likely an important driving factor
7407192 it might be about 1 5 degrees warmer at the end of this century
7407193 but global warming as proclaimed by al gore and co is a hoax

7407215 nuns are a bit excluded they are a bit marginalized in ecclesiastical life
7407216 this will be an occasion to make their contribution more visible
7407217 we are not going to parade nuns in bathing suits
7407218 but being ugly is not a requirement for becoming a nun external beauty is gift from god and we mustnt hide it
7407219 its an initiative that belittles the role of nuns who have dedicated themselves to god

7407228 if we didnt blog people would start to wonder about us
7407229 its a phenomenal promotion vehicle for a company or a great crisis tool or a great customer service tool
7407230 were trying to be as open and disclose as much information as we can
7407231 we gave a very loud voice to the people who said they werent happy about this decision
7407232 the blog at least helps people see how we think about it
7407233 thats the importance of public relations of advertising of everything we do

7407239 we had a number of opportunities to do some damage

7407245 the democratic party is about as united as ive ever seen it
7407246 maybe theres some clinton supporters out there who havent seen the light yet but they need to get over it
7407247 the view that john mccain is this cuddly old grandpa is just a bunch of you know what hes anti choice anti healthcare and more pro iraq war than george bush and dick cheney
7407248 i cannot put into words what it feels like knowing that ill be witnessing something this historic
7407249 when youre a kid in school you learn about martin luther king and the i have a dream speech
7407250 and now 45 years to the day of that speech well be seeing an african american accepting the democratic nomination for president
7407251 im not a conspiracy theorist obamas going to win the nomination
7407252 even though id still like hillary to be the nominee and get elected president im excited about the democrats chances this year i think were going to win
7407253 the iraq war weighed heavily with me and he was against it from the start plus i like what hes saying about the economy and the environment
7407254 ive taken him with me to so many meetings and rallies this past year that he must think that mommy just has a ton of friends
7407255 the reliance upon a drinking age of 21 is an overly simple solution to a very complex problem which is the place of alcohol in america
7407256 everything we can do to foster a safe and positive campus climate is a step in the right direction
7407257 if reducing the legal drinking age is the right answer then it is a step well need to take but well also need to consider the potential ramifications to those not in college those under 21 who may still be in high school
7407258 what weve done is helped create an underground culture that encourages binge drinking without any oversight or supervision
7407259 as it stands about 5 000 people under 21 die each year due to underage drinking
7407260 this is not to mention the sexual assaults violence and injuries
7407261 its a great thing to honor the people on flight 93 by putting together all three attack sites the pentagon the world trade center and pennsylvania
7407262 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever

7407270 cuanto antes mejor sin duda pero tenemos que estar seguros de que lo que decimos a las familias es la verdad
7407271 espa a tiene un sistema de control y supervisi n muy exigente el mismo que se sigue en toda europa y por el que se cumplen estrictamente todos los protocolos establecidos en la ue en
7407272 fomento sabe que hay aerol neas que ponen en peligro la seguridad
7407273 las empresas coaccionan a sus pilotos y t cnicos para no denunciar irregularidades y la administraci n intimida a sus inspectores
7407274 un gran debate nacional sobre las condiciones de la seguridad a rea
7407275 que se tomen las medidas oportunas para que esto no vuelva a acontecer
7407276 al detectarse un peque o problema el comandante decidi aterrizar con total normalidad en el aeropuerto de m laga

7407280 en los ltimos a os el pse ha pactado los presupuestos del gobierno vasco con el pnv y los ciudadanos lo han entendido
7407281 zapatero tiene pavor al debate de financiaci n auton mica
7407282 a zapatero no es que no le preocupe la financiaci n auton mica sino que le da pavor los suyo ha sido una aut ntica espantada se ha librado de tener que explicar en el congreso la reforma de financiaci n de los grandes servicios sociales que est n en manos de comunidades y ayuntamientos as como del reparto de impuestos de todos los espa oles en su lugar ha mandado al ministro de econom a pedro solbes
7407283 el gobierno est cada vez m s solitario en el congreso como demuestra el hecho de que negocie la financiaci n con alg n grupo minoritario
7407284 apoyar el proyecto del gobierno socialista cuando la crisis econ mica que vive espa a se est agravando y ste no est haciendo sus deberes conlleva un desgaste pol tico enorme
7407285 en pol tica hay que tener criterio propio y solbes no lo tiene la medida de los 400 euros no era suya el ministro de industria miguel sebasti n lo cont en un art culo y todo el mundo lo sabe y sin embargo aplic la deducci n de mala gana hay que tener mucho cuidado con esta forma de hacer pol tica
7407286 esto es lo que me dijeron en 2004 pero son elecciones que nada tienen que ver con las decisiones que ya tom el partido en su momento
7407287 vamos a batir el r cord en marketing dirigido a los hispanos
7407288 si los presupuestos no se prorrogan es porque el gobierno nos ha vendido
7407289 el debate que ha abierto zapatero sobre financiaci n desvertebra el modelo de estado y la unidad nacional
7407290 estos han sido los juegos de las apariencias y de las mentiras
7407291 la acumulaci n de incidencias en las centrales nucleares durante los ltimos meses y la reciente propuesta de sanci n millonaria a la planta de asc por irregularidades en el mantenimiento obligan a considerar que su proceso de conservaci n requiere un incremento de calidad y medios para evitar peri dicas alarmas y minimizar los riesgos
7407292 cada vez que se les da una oportunidad de manifestarse la aprovechan para lanzar soflamas amenazantes para hacer apolog a del terrorismo o para enaltecer a pistoleros
7407293 no puede hacerse es facilitarles el caldo de cultivo necesario para su envalentonamiento con la salida de prisi n de de juana chaos semanas atr s o con la inminente de arnaldo otegi ya es suficiente
7407294 el mayor peso que ha tomado la fed en la vigilancia de los bancos de inversi n es consecuente con el protagonismo asumido en la gesti n de esta crisis fortalecer una perspectiva m s amplia de la supervisi n es una lecci n que no por urgente de aplicar en ee uu es menos relevante en el resto del mundo como lo es esa prudencia en el manejo de los tipos de inter s en un contexto en el que la mayor a de las econom as de la ocde no puede descartar la recesi n
7407295 debe pasar a la acci n de concretar su programa y explicar claramente sus propuestas pues ya se le ha acabado el tiempo de las frases atrayentes y de los gestos medi ticos
7407296 last night biden wanted to leave his driveway and drive straight to the white house and tell bush paraphrasing that he knows what the world needs
7407297 i dont know if you are aware that i am a decorated vietnam war veteran
7407298 whether or not our next president and congress dismantle empire usa plus turning things around here at home
7407299 obama had a fork in the road go for experience or change
7407300 with the possible exception of al gore i cant think of someone who generates as much excitement
7407301 mccain was the same for nearly seventy years then he changed
7407302 claiming that mccain suddenly transformed into a different bad man is not plausible
7407303 launching implausible negative attacks is not the new politics weve been promised
7407304 its not just something biden is making up back during the primaries i remember talking to a lot of people about how i thought the 2000 version of mccain might have made a pretty good president but the 2008 model not so much but then the 2000 version would never have won the republican nomination which is why he moved so far to the right
7407305 i think bidens gaffes tend to be pretty superficial they dont reflect a fundamental lack of knowledge or empathy far from it so much as a certain ham fistedness in putting words together this is almost entirely forgivable and unlikely to create long term problems
7407306 i voted for the bill before i voted against it
7407307 we the people are responsible and accountable for what does or does not happen in washington and the fact is is too many american families are following the bad example of the federal government theyre spending more money than they make theyre charging their credit cards taking out home equity loans mortgaging their future
7407308 pretty mild but doctors will have a better idea in the next several days

7407320 i probably would have started as soon as i could pick up the racket
7407321 my mum used to represent new zealand and dad was a tennis player he played in the davis cup
7407322 women tend to peak in their late 20s so hopefully ive got more to come its a pretty hard sport on your body though
7407323 although this is clearly better than not lifting the gag order its also not much of a victory for the first amendment the fact is that the mit students had every right to make their presentation on flaws in the mbtas electronic fare system and they were not allowed to do so
7407324 it seemed like we were instantly thrown into this category that we were just kids and not responsible
7407325 if the dog has an accident what kind of action will you take
7407326 theres no question that these organizations have the best interests of the animals at heart but they shouldnt be playing god
7407327 you have no idea how traumatic abandonment is for animals
7407328 of course we want animals to find homes but we dont want to do it without any regard for the end result
7407329 some people have an attitude who are you to tell me what kind of dog i can adopt we are the people who decide where the dog goes and if we dont think youre going to be a proper owner thats it because two months down the road we know that dog is coming back
7407330 were fine tuning our mission about what it means to be a good pet owner
7407331 we got a lecture about how having a dog is a big responsibility
7407332 its been a while since weve reviewed any kind of toys and what i have today might be considered a toy or not
7407333 for review today ive got a micro sd t flash card reader from our friends at usbfever and its possibly the worlds smallest card reader on the market today
7407334 the crucial link in the chain for getting the best performance from the patriot viper pc3 16000 2gb memory kit is whether or not your motherboard and processor can handle front side bus increases if your nvidia or intel chipset based motherboard cant give you something upwards of at least 1600 mhz fsb then you wont really be tapping in to the bulk of the memorys potential nvidia 790i users can at least expect great things from the bios memory and cpu bus link option a quick change to a memory setting or two and youre running at 2000 mhz but again youll get much better results if you at least tap in to your processors 1600 mhz fsb potential
7407335 tragically one person is deceased as a result of the incident one person is currently being treated for hypothermia
7407336 and if youre happy being an asshole its freeing you end up quite cool
7407337 there have been many times in my career when ive thought of quitting four years ago i sent away for an application from columbia university i was thinking of getting an m a in creative writing and then teaching it but i was saved i took over for
7407338 we allege the defendant wrongfully enriched himself while he was in the office
7407339 the income derived from the units at todays prices is attractive
7407340 its our view that the heavily discounted price will reverse in due course as the benefits of the diversification strategy of the trust are better recognised
7407341 this means that further rental growth will be available in the year ahead in the year to date rental reviews have resulted in an increase to the trusts income of over 1m
7407342 many commentators have observed the potential for property values to ease over the year ahead and clearly in times of economic change this cannot be ruled out
7407343 however rental growth within the property portfolio already evident since year end provides at least a partial buffer to this pressure
7407344 indeed we have recently negotiated conditional agreements to sell assets in excess of 60m at or around book value as at march 31
7407345 obviously theres a couple of teams that are top that have dominated the competition for the last 18 months
7407346 we give ourselves every chance and as long as we prepare right well take it as it comes
7407347 we probably havent put a full game together which weve been really happy with but theres definitely three quarters or half a game which is how wed like to play our football
7407348 and i think weve been putting some good scores on the board and also stopping the opposition so if we can do that for four quarters well give ourselves every chance to be successful
7407349 we were obviously a little up and down towards the start of the year and i think with two breaks this year weve come back pretty well and won seven of our last nine games
7407350 so its definitely positive and hopefully weve got a little bit more improvement in us
7407351 i dont know a lot about our position and what we need to happen but i think we need a few teams to lose and for us to have a pretty comfortable win
7407352 its pretty pricey but at the end of the day few would disagree it now gives national foods more scale in australia said deutsche bank analyst kristan walker
7407353 the australian assets including lion nathan have been one of the major earnings drivers for kirin so it looks as though australia is becoming a more meaningful place of investment for them
7407354 national foods has the capability and financial strength to leverage the dairy farmers acquisition to create new business opportunities domestically and in the vitally important asian region managing director ashley waugh said
7407355 may be too closely aligned with people who hold radical political views
7407356 senator obama has made a choice more out of weakness than strength
7407357 the strong choice would have been hillary clinton the obvious choice would have been hillary clinton
7407358 she had 50 per cent of the democratic vote obama has 50 per cent of the democratic vote you almost have to go to extraordinary lengths to avoid her as the vice presidential pick of the party
7407359 shes going to be an important an important voice in this campaign
7407360 but obama felt that senator biden would be the best fit for him at this time
7407361 theyre going to be won over by the clintons appearance this week and what they say
7407362 we still dont have a lot of answers about senator obama
7407363 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
7407364 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
7407365 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
7407366 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
7407367 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
7407368 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
7407369 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
7407370 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
7407371 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
7407372 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
7407373 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
7407374 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
7407375 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
7407376 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
7407377 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
7407378 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
7407379 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
7407380 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
7407381 it is going to be a very emotional time for me
7407382 living in the south i never thought i would see the day
7407383 some people have a vision of tennessee as one of the racist places
7407384 verbal dissent should be placed in the appropriate place in the baggage before we leave
7407385 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
7407386 getting away with murder how politics is destroying the criminal justice system
7407387 making the case for yourself a diet book for smart women
7407388 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7407389 that global warming is unequivocal and that human activity is the main driver very likely causing most of the rise in temperatures since 1950
7407390 with ties to the oil and gas coal and timber industries
7407391 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7407392 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7407393 they have enabled spammers to push down their costs through economies of scale and eliminated the need for spammers to host their own spam servers as they simply take control of other peoples computers instead
7407394 recent fbi prosecutions of bot herders and investigations of message boards used by spammers suggests the going rate for spammers to send a million spam messages is as little as 5 10
7407395 shouting at me that i couldnt just hit people and drive away but i didnt know id hit him i really didnt have any idea it happened until they flagged me down and told me
7407396 custom spectrum made by bike maker tom kelly he doesnt measure you he just looks at you on your bike

7407398 the guy who rode his bike in front of novaks car
7407399 were a city that invites tourists to come and walk around our downtown to stroll along among our memorials and museums people have to look at this event and wonder if thats safe
7407400 i was hoping the team would get the colbert bump
7407401 i love this piece because its the disconnect we dont know our neighbors
7407402 im sure he planned it that theyre really close but not touching
7407403 it really fed into the art programs in the schools and how to grow them it was wonderful
7407404 its a great example of how museums address societal needs
7407405 the primary objective for this program is to come away with a better sense of modern and contemporary art
7407406 you can see the light bulbs and the sparks going off as theyre getting new ideas each day
7407407 plus im really excited that teachers in other disciplines want to use art to teach

7407412 at first all i could do was lie on the mat and do the poses in my head
7407413 when i started teaching i threw the yoga pictures away
7407414 the sound of the ocean the feel of the sand its very special
7407415 i stumbled onto the beach and met gina five years ago
7407416 yoga gives you this balance this inner calm you dont have to take medication to get it
7407417 we want no child getting a diploma who cannot read write or do math
7407418 but at the same time we as a state will not find it acceptable to push kids out
7407419 these changes are taking place and parents have no idea what is coming down the pike for students
7407420 my biggest concern is that these new regulations could keep a kid from graduating who should be able to get a diploma and go to college or get a job
7407421 my objective is to get this formally approved at the sept 3 meeting
7407422 because its really important for the districts to know what the expectations are so they can begin to work on them
7407423 we are not opposed to testing and we totally support the goals of the regents to have high performing school systems and students
7407424 but the tests were designed to be a check on the system not as a punitive measure against students particularly against students currently in the pipeline why is this on the backs of the kids
7407425 for remediation where is this money coming from what is the regents plan for that
7407426 i feel like we are raising legitimate questions as parents and taxpayers and we are entitled to that information
7407427 we just dont want kids to get hurt in the process or fall through the cracks through no fault of their own
7407428 parents can walk away from this knowing the education their kid is getting is better
7407429 if we dont think a district has everything in place we are not going to have the kids pay the price
7407430 the one thing that could re create the west is russia acting in opposition to the west nato had lost its way the russians have created a situation which gives nato a raison detre again to contain russia
7407431 there was no nato meeting no eu meeting the russians assume there are divisions and they are right
7407432 theres no unity at all within europe the newer eu countries are far more anti russian than the older ones
7407433 of course many countries like germany and italy that buy their oil and gas from russia they have to worry that if the relationship deteriorates it will have an impact on their economy
7407434 the way it unfolds in germany will be tremendously important because germany is an in between country
7407435 during the cold war europe always had a more moderate position than the united states had a more pragmatic position just for reasons of geographic proximity and because europe tends to have a more pragmatic policy than the u s

7407446 against the seahawks we came out and threw it a lot early even though we had a couple runs called we audibled to a couple passes because of bad looks but against the 49ers we came out and ran the ball and you ask any offensive lineman anywhere and thats what they want to do they want to have a chance to come out and run the ball and get after people a little bit and get a feel for the flow of the game and i thought they did
7407447 he manages the game very well and thats not a negative theres nothing wrong with that
7407448 but hes not just a game manager his rookie year when he came in obviously the package we had for him was limited and with our defense and special teams we asked him basically to do that for the most part but he is so much better of a quarterback than that its a positive that he does manage the game and has great presence and football intelligence but he can do much more than that
7407449 i play in the trenches dude thats like dog years
7407450 i had a herniated disc before i got here i guess that would be the red flag
7407451 we knew that everyone knew that it just was a thing where most people it doesnt affect it wasnt affecting me so if nothing is broke you dont fix it
7407452 then something happened in practice that second day the disc started moving and that caused some problems
7407453 i didnt miss a practice or a game in college
7407454 obviously if it was something serious i would have because if i could play with it in college i sure as heck could play with it for money
7407455 what the doctors told me this was a new injury he had injured his back approximately three years ago he had no symptoms of any kind of herniation when that injury occurred he had no missed time in the last three years so its a new injury
7407456 a goodly amount of players in the league play with this or worse
7407457 he never had any of these symptoms in college and thats what we went on there was some risk but it was more of a yellow flag than a red flag
7407458 he did have wear and tear which all players have including the other seven offensive linemen taken in the first round according to angelo i would do it again based on the information i was given
7407459 im pretty sure i am ahead of schedule in my rehab im pretty confident in whats going on with that
7407460 head athletic trainer tim bream said im ahead of schedule as far as my progress im doing cardio stairmaster and elliptical and im doing some walking and lifting i dont know when i will actually be able to run
7407461 im trying to get back in shape its fixed now i feel great i feel better than i did any day in training camp its just a matter of healing
7407462 the healing time is something that you cant speed up but with that being said i can do a lot of things as far as gaining my strength back i can do upper body i can do lower body i can do just about everything working my core
7407463 i can do basically all the machine lifts it gives me a chance to kind of get back to where i was when i got to training camp by the time the injury heals up the only other thing i will have to work on is getting my flexibility back
7407464 even at the same location the temperature near the ground may be very different from the temperature 5 feet 1 52m above the ground and different again from 10 feet or 50 feet above the ground
7407465 particularly in the presence of vegetation say in a rainforest the temperature above the vegetation may be very different from the temperature below the top of the vegetation
7407466 a reasonable suggestion might be to use the average temperature of the first 50 feet of air either above ground or above the top of the vegetation to measure sat surface air temperature we have to agree on what it is and as far as i know no such standard has been suggested or generally adopted

7407535 my full name is adeniyi oluwadamilare mongolia oxygen malomo most people call me niyi but since you are going to be my friend i will let you call me a special name that ill decide on
7407536 ok ive thought about it and you can call me kachakachiki
7407537 oh those names arent from my parents i gave them to myself
7407538 oh i was looking at an atlas a few years ago and i came across this country called mongolia i liked the name so much i decided to make it one of my names as for oxygen well my science teacher told me that its very important it gives life to living beings so i thought that i would add that to my list of names too since i want to be as important as oxygen
7407539 they know but i think they are used to my way of doing things so they just pretend that i dont have those names
7407540 i like to play around with things for example there was time when i wanted to find out whether it was possible to produce black hibiscus flowers by watering the plant with water that had been dyed green

7407542 but you arent achieving what you want you always start with a new idea or project and then a few days into it it fizzles out when you think of something new
7407543 well why should i continue pursuing an idea if i have an even better idea at least i have set the ball in motion for anyone who is interested in pursuing the idea better for me to free my intelligence to pursue more important matters

7407549 much of todays personal development literature is about how the type of thoughts you think influence your reality while i agree that the kind of thoughts you think affect your quality of life i think its also important to recognize how the amount of thinking you do shapes your experience of living theres a growing recognition that too much thought of any kind whether positive or negative can bring needless suffering into your life in this article i discuss some of the ways excess thinking takes away our ability to fully participate in and enjoy life and make some suggestions about how to stem the constant stream of thought

7407562 barack obama is an extremist who in supporting what amounts to infanticide would like to see all of us stand idle twiddling our thumbs as unplanned children who are born alive die this terrible death
7407563 we must realize this is definitely part of mr obamas plan for america
7407564 its hard to believe that this man who wants to hold the highest office in this land would not only oppose legislation to protect children born alive but would then lie about it for four years stating that he didnt oppose it
7407565 for four years obama misrepresented his vote saying that the bill he opposed in the illinois state senate was different from the bill that was passed by the u s senate and signed into law by president bush
7407566 suppose that a woman goes to an abortion facility for an abortion and by some blessing the child survives alive barack obama has voted that the abortionist medical staff and anyone else in the room should stand by and watch the child die a horrible death gasping for air without lifting a finger to help him or her
7407567 sen biden has consistently expressed support for a womans right to choose
7407568 while we have not agreed with him on every vote we have a longstanding relationship with sen biden that is open positive and constructive and we are confident this will continue in a new administration under sen obamas pro choice leadership
7407569 senator hillary clinton was our first choice and that of 18 million primary voters but presumptive democratic nominee senator barack obamas pick joe biden is a strong selection for vice president
7407570 now welcomes this important opportunity for one of our champions to participate in a national dialogue around issues that are facing our country and our world
7407571 we know that senator john mccain the presumptive republican nominee is a longstanding opponent of abortion and now pac will actively work to prevent him from becoming president

7407575 chaput is arguably the most respected leader of the catholic church in america
7407576 his record is a strong commitment to social and economic justice and the principles of the catholic faith hes also a strong patriot
7407577 pro life democrats who are proud catholics like myself feel this is an insult to our values
7407578 the democratic party has already driven millions of faithful catholics to the gop what they are doing now will continue that mass exodus
7407579 if we believe in the sanctity of life from conception to natural death we need to prove that by our actions including our political choices
7407580 the choice in abortion always involves the choice to end the life of an unborn human being
7407581 for anyone who sees this fact clearly neutrality silence or private disapproval are not options they are evils almost as grave as abortion itself sign up for free pro life news from lifenews com twice weekly pro life
7407582 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7407583 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain

7407605 first the wolf pack finds the weakest easiest target in the herd usually the young aged or injured
7407606 wolves have already been reintroduced to yellowstone the fact that people will eventually die as a result is seen as irrelevant by the groups responsible
7407607 terminating these animals means keeping the numbers of wildlife herds at a level we can hunt and eat for years to come
7407608 and we all know where that money will come from the pockets of hunters trappers and fishermen
7407609 what lost said was 12 01 am we should all run after our meat and rip its throat out with our teeth to kill it
7407610 we should all run after our meat and rip its throat out with our teeth to kill it
7407611 if any of you are capable of killing whatever youre hunting this year in the same manner as a wolf then you might have some real prowess
7407612 whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7407613 this working class kid from scranton and wilmington has always been a friend to the underdog and all who seek a safer and more prosperous america to live their dreams and raise their families
7407614 youll have a sense of who she is and what our values are and how were raising our kids
7407615 and i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us
7407616 we figured wed be fine if they said disperse wed disperse but we never got the chance
7407617 stop the torture stop the war thats what were fighting for
7407618 you cant compare new york which has buildings all around to denver that has open areas
7407619 we would be remiss if we didnt prepare for mass arrests
7407620 people would sit in buses waiting hours days to be processed if we didnt have this set up
7407621 we have a pamphlet called the constitution a lot of us have read it already
7407622 changing the law to transform innocent behavior into a crime where it poses no threat to public safety is entirely uncalled for and inconsistent with principles of the first amendment
7407623 it has a chilling effect on free speech and that has been found time and time again to be improper under first amendment principles
7407624 we want to throw a party for the children so its going to be like a carnival for free
7407625 the heart behind it is we want to do a random act of kindness for some kids who deserve it
7407626 its going to be full of activities and everything a kid could ever want

7407636 the area received an enormous amount of rain in a short period of time between two to four inches with as much as 5 inches in some areas
7407637 creeks retention ponds streams theyre all running at capacity so any additional rain would certainly worsen the situation
7407638 the main concern is rain and the potential for flooding
7407639 there is potential for very heavy rainfall in these storms
7407640 a priority to clarify the civil and societal benefits of this research to give them a new legitimacy and to put them firmly in a context of positive social dynamics
7407641 in contrast to the u s approach which exhibits a strong technodeterminist approach see for example the analysis in
7407642 specifying the type of interdisciplinarity in the nsfs nbic scenario
7407643 a strong engagement of a broad variety of ssh in the debate analysis and shaping of actual processes of technoscientific convergence can decisively contribute to overcoming a one dimensional sociologically and philosophically na ve conception of these processes and to embedding the dynamic developments in the nbic fields into the european knowledge society
7407644 the stakes of this election will be made very clear
7407645 back in june and july i truly thought he was going to blow mccain out of the water and carry 30 or 40 states
7407646 what has happened is that republicans mccain specifically have really twisted his great charisma this electric personality to discredit his ability his experience his capacity his judgment i fear they are about to do to him what they did to gore
7407647 obama has got to do some things that will shore up his ability to lead not just to charm but to lead theyve got to give credibility to his understanding of foreign policy his ability to deal with tough people and tough questions and his ability to be more explicit and convincing on his health care policies and energy policies
7407648 normally i might say these conventions are not so important but i dont think thats the case this year
7407649 there seems to be a sense of urgency we have had a couple of weeks that were not so good
7407650 i think in the case of mccain they need to frame him
7407651 viscerally my feeling is theyve got to come back at him hard and theyve got to do more to complete the task of definition both definition of him as well as definition of john mccain
7407652 he has still got to get to the meat and potato blue collar workers this is a big opportunity for him
7407653 i have a lot of doubts that this convention is going to be as persuasive as it should be because theyve got this d thing with hillary
7407654 i love hillary i was for her but this is the worst political decision i could imagine this is supposed to be an obama celebration youre going to get the nomination of someone who came very close to winning and youre going to get a lot of people in there cheering and hollering and some people booing

7407658 mod is very pleased with the success of the recent trial which demonstrated the potential capability of the technologies in zephyr this success has also reinforced the close working relationship between the uk and us on these key technologies

7407660 we continue to investigate the root cause of the issue including but not limited to the third party website that has allegedly facilitated this illegal exchange of information
7407661 weve already lost our son our honour weve sold our land to pay for legal costs and weve lost our home what else can we lose
7407662 without any added nuance 1 one view popularized by scott hahn is that jesus is here referring to the fourth cup at passover the sour wine that jesus drank served as the fourth cup the drinking of which he had skipped at the last supper or so this interpretation holds thus in this interpretation jesus has completed or finished the passover while on the cross 2 another interpretation holds that jesus shows here that he is the master of his own fate in that he has laid down his life by his own will st augustine says thus when jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished
7407663 christ our passover lamb is sacrificed for us let us do nothing any more but just believe
7407664 because we were smart enough to acquire valuable skills that the market rewards
7407665 this is the packaging and delivery section here the graces and blessings the people asked for are processed and delivered to the living persons who asked for them
7407666 how is it that there is no work going on here
7407667 after people receive the blessings that they asked for very few send back acknowledgments
7407668 if you have food in the refrigerator clothes on your back a roof overhead and a place to sleep you are richer than 75 of this world
7407669 thank you lord for giving me the ability to share this message and for giving me so many wonderful people to share it with
7407670 bringing out the hardcover last year during the hectic lead in to the primaries didnt help the book because it was perceived by some to be a campaign tool its actually a fine and moving memoir
7407671 hed work as hard as he could and harder than anybody else and that would either see it through or not he put his whole campaign on his shoulder
7407672 all he could do was go up to new hampshire and be john mccain
7407673 it was a streak of good fortune that he ran out of money and went up there and was himself thats what people love that he is himself not some sort of synthetic character trying to figure out who he is
7407674 the middle seat on southwest gave me a lot more opportunity to interact with voters
7407675 im not complaining still have town hall meetings still able to do 95 percent of what i did before
7407676 elaborate upon his stated intention to reduce the number of abortions by providing alternative programs
7407677 if we create or become a mirror image of the religious right we have failed
7407678 but if we have increased the number of chairs around the table then weve succeeded
7407679 people of faith are being engaged in the convention in a new and robust way and its because of senator obamas acknowledgment that people of faith and values have an important place in american public life
7407680 now theres a genuine interest in speaking with groups and religious groups who were previously considered enemies

7407683 i didnt even know the dnc was in town i dont watch the news
7407684 if i had known i would have done things differently it was a simple mistake
7407685 a religious war going on in our country for the soul of america it is a cultural war
7407686 hello george this is ron reagan id like to go over to the convention and announce that youre my choice for vice president if thats alright with you
7407687 i think to some degree ive become a shorthand or a symbol or a stand in for now
7407688 its a spirit that says we are looking for different
7407689 the only way we will be successful is if we are unified as a party and all democrats know we are full partners
7407690 we realize that mistakes have been made but were excited in florida
7407691 we had the guts to take the system on and we made progress this year
7407692 in key states markets where hillary clinton performed well and denver
7407693 the power to this message is that youre using the democrats own words
7407694 the mccain guys have successfully used the rapid response to set the terms of the debate on the eve of the democrats convention
7407695 we still dont have a lot of answers about senator obama
7407696 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket why for speaking the truth
7407697 she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care
7407698 john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7407699 who do you want to answer the phone at 3 a m
7407700 as long as clinton was a viable candidate in the democratic nomination process many of our members felt a passionate need to return the loyalty she has earned over decades of support
7407701 the reality is that this is going to be barack obamas week
7407702 we dont have any illusions about the challenges we face in getting our message out but you cant expect people to cover you if you dont show up
7407703 there should be a balance and we want to make sure were available to tell the other side of the story
7407704 i think to some degree ive become a shorthand or a symbol or a stand in for now
7407705 its a spirit that says we are looking for different
7407706 tomorrow we have a celebration the night doth draw near we know that dagon hungers from the sea his voice we can hear
7407707 red rocks is one of the places you take your cousins when theyre in town
7407708 in one day you can play golf see a moody blues concert a baby bison a 1 000 year old fen all in the denver parks system
7407709 the first step perhaps the greatest step in the great movement of making our mountains available for the people
7407710 we dont need half the crap they are pushing on us
7407711 were a big part of this were also a very large delegation its kind of hard to miss us and its really going to be hard to miss us now
7407712 right now its wonderful to be whole to know that our state has a voice when youre spanked you feel it
7407713 we have to come together we cant have a party divided
7407714 the only way we will be successful is if we are unified as a party
7407715 and we know that after the storm the sun always comes out
7407716 we have to move on from here and get about the business of electing a democrat to the white house
7407717 they accept the principle that weve been fighting for that no state should have a dominant position
7407718 what i want us to walk away from this whole experience with is how do we make this better
7407719 as a floridian i hope that they give us our votes back
7407720 as a person who looks at the impact it is going to have on 2012 i have to wonder about it
7407721 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7407722 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7407723 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7407724 what we have witnessed in beijing is a truly spectacular olympic games
7407725 we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to build on this moment
7407726 its all full of junk there how would you like to have a house next to you like that how would you like to have a nice home next to that
7407727 it degrades the whole neighborhood if he can get away with it anybody can put their junk out there
7407728 this is very nice stuff this is just great stuff
7407729 if you had to go out and buy this youd be taking 20 out of your pocket ive talked to the head of code enforcement two or three times im going to fix the place up
7407730 there are some people who have issues with hoarding or being pack rats they accumulate things that would not be acceptable to the normal neighbor
7407731 where we are really hard pressed to come up with a solution is when its homesteaded property we cant foreclose on homestead property you cant take away somebodys domicile but you can place a lien on it and keep them from selling it or transferring other property in most cases its an issue where the person may not have capabilities or capacity to understand what they are doing
7407732 ninety percent of our cases are resolved before they get to the board its that last 10 percent that we spend most of our time on
7407733 its an intense process but one thats well worth it
7407734 my year we opened the letters on the field and it made it a spectacle
7407735 its just kind of cool to come out here and see how the other side works
7407736 i think this is the reason sorority girls binge drink
7407737 im really excited that both of my sisters are in the same sorority
7407738 pi beta phi was my favorite because the girls are laid back and fun
7407739 darum hat sie auch gott dahingegeben in die gel ste ihrer herzen in unreinigkeit zu sch nden ihre eigenen leiber an sich selber sie die gottes wahrheit in die l ge verwandelt haben und haben geehrt und gedient dem gesch pfe mehr denn dem sch pfer der da gelobt ist in ewigkeit
7407740 ein sonniger junimorgen als hape kerkeling bekennende couch potato endg ltig seinen inneren schweinehund besiegt und in st jean pied de port aufbricht sechs wochen liegen vor ihm allein mit sich und seinem elf kilo schweren rucksack ber die schneebedeckten gipfel der pyren en durch das baskenland navarra und rioja bis nach galicien zum grab des heiligen jakob seit ber tausend jahren ziel f r gl ubige aus der ganzen welt mit charme witz und blick f r das besondere erschlie t kerkeling sich die fremden regionen lernt er die einheimischen ebenso wie moderne pilger und ihre rituale kennen er erlebt einsamkeit und stille ersch pfung und zweifel aber auch hilfsbereitschaft freundschaften und belohnungen und eine ganz eigene n he zu gott in seinem buch ber den wert des wanderns zeigt der beliebte spa macher wie er auch noch ist abenteuerlustig weltoffen meditativ

7407742 please dont let these horrifying images be the last i see
7407743 yep and mama wait until you hear this one its a little sexy
7407744 mama im conflicted i dont want to encourage him that would be cruel because i dont really intend to take this any further then again i dont want this to stop
7407745 yes your letter was lovely i dont know what to say but yes i think about us also
7407746 are you freakin kidding me are you for real is this a con did you have bowl of clueless for breakfast surely you must know the affect it has on me and said it exactly for that reason i inspire you after thirty nine years really i was fifteen years old im a woman now let me show you what an inspiration i can really be
7407747 how does it feel to know how you inspire me after all these years
7407748 and then deleted two paragraphs of pure raw honesty yes ever the coward thats me yet i still felt compelled to tell on myself
7407749 if you dont tell him how you feel youll regret it again
7407750 i went over there and these people were so happy and they had nothing they were so loyal respectful and loving they had their families and thats all they needed
7407751 its not about having the finer things in life its nice to have but you dont have to throw it in other peoples faces you can spend money on better things besides shoes and purses you can use money to help people in need and the less fortunate
7407752 i have my own money i havent asked for anything from my dad
7407753 im 19 years old and its time to take care of myself i want to show everyone a different side of me
7407754 to my surprise i would have never guessed that she would have changed so much and got some accountability
7407755 i never in a million years thought shed come back with the newfound respect and love shes got for her family she definitely learned something over there im so proud of her
7407756 shes not that girl you saw on that sweet 16 show shes awesome
7407757 she thought wouldnt it be great if these kids went away and saw how other people lived
7407758 i love ann dvorak i still remember her in i was an american spy when the japanese villains stick a hose down her throat i never forgot that
7407759 however if she wants to talk to you on the status of contract refer her to me personally immediately
7407760 i still expect to win the primary but in the unlikely event that i dont im in it to the end
7407761 i know im the one guy who can go to washington and get things done because ive gotten things done all my life
7407762 jack davis is showing his true colors as a spoiler in the race concerned only with his own self interests
7407763 hes not the least bit concerned about the voters in the democratic primary and his campaign is quickly becoming all about him
7407764 isnt the least bit concerned about the voters in the democratic primary
7407765 are you ok ld whats wrong youre not in a good mood right
7407766 great car everything about it except its starting problem that just sprung up
7407767 i which i could buy a new one just like it
7407768 fun to drive with many upgrades for the speed freak at heart
7407769 if hes up to it in the 11th hour and can get the green light from doctors he might be able to pull it off
7407770 i think keith has gone too far i think chris has gone too far
7407771 but anytime you pick a catholic its also courting controversy
7407772 you cant find a more regular guy than joe biden
7407773 he would be the kind of guy you would expect to find in the parish hall in the neighborhood that kind of personality when combined with the kind of reflective christianity barack obama has demonstrated is a winning combination
7407774 is as close to were going to be able to get as a society
7407775 there are elements within the church who say that if you are at odds with any of the teachings of the church you are at odds with the church i think the church is bigger than that
7407776 but his record of support for so called abortion rights while mixed at times is seriously wrong i certainly presume his good will and integrity and i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
7407777 i dont think its a happy day for catholics when a man who is literally dead wrong on what the catholic leadership of the united states has said for over three decades is the most important issue of social justice in our country is named to a national ticket and attempts to present himself as an intellectually serious and coherent catholic
7407778 the next republican that tells me im not religious im going to shove my rosary beads down their throat
7407779 hes this scrappy irish catholic and he has a long and powerful record of speaking his mind
7407780 i dont think hes going to take any attacks sitting down

7407813 hemos cambiado de entrenador se rescindi el contrato de frank rijkaard una decisi n que siempre es dif cil pero hemos garantizado la continuidad del modelo del buen f tbol con la contrataci n de josep guardiola
7407814 pens que no era el momento de dimitir justo cuando se renuevan las plantillas y que no era conveniente que el bar a se quedase sin presidente a principio de temporada e iniciar una espiral de procesos electorales
7407815 un club d bil e inestable s lo beneficia a nuestros rivales
7407816 our concern is his weight has definitely been evident throughout our community he has been a heavyweight for championing the cause our kids and our community so were asking if you want to take weight into consideration let the weight of his deeds let the weight of deeds again outweigh what his physical weight is
7407817 a lot of people had high gpas and still didnt get accepted
7407818 we could because of quality take a lot more students if the resources would allow us
7407819 we continue to tell them what weve always told them keep your options open and apply to other universities
7407820 there are a lot of kids that have kind of accepted their fate
7407821 ufs now looking at the big picture beyond grades and curriculum
7407822 to be a really successful university you must have the elements of diversity
7407823 the annual conduct of the ncae gives the students and the parents an idea on the field of endeavor most suited to the graduating students thus allowing for better decision on their choice of career
7407824 so far their return to normal life is going well some 15 000 evacuees from ozamis have returned to their homes
7407825 youll have a sense of who she is and what our values are and how were raising our kids
7407826 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket
7407827 you almost have to go to extraordinary lengths to avoid her as the vice presidential pick of the democratic party
7407828 has a high regard for senator clinton shes going to be an important voice in this campaign shes going to be an important voice in moving this country forward in the next administration he felt that senator biden would be the best fit for him at this time
7407829 hillary clintons support of barack obama is clear she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care
7407830 john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7407831 i dont have to lead you to anything its showed up over the last eight years
7407832 every time we got something to dry land the river would rise and things would start to float away again people who have lived here for 30 40 years said theyve never seen it like that
7407833 hes sort of like us he comes from a middle class background went to school on scholarships he and his wife had to figure out child care and how to start a college fund for their kids
7407834 a better sense of who he is and where hed like to lead the country
7407835 the only way we will be successful is if we are unified as a party and all democrats know we are full partners
7407836 i have a responsibility i do not own my vote i have to represent the voters who sent me
7407837 ultimately we look forward to a debate between joe biden and barack obama about whether barack obama has the judgment and experience to lead
7407838 the president has argued that confronting iraq would not detract from the unfinished war against terrorism i believe he is right we should be able to walk and chew gum at the same time
7407839 i am absolutely confident the president will not take us to war alone i am absolutely confident we will enhance his ability to get the world to be with us by us voting for this resolution
7407840 i did talk to him on the phone a short while ago and told him that he is in everyones thoughts and prayers
7407841 it was obviously the news that i did not want to hear
7407842 but after listening to the explanation and dr warrens thoughts on it i am convinced that this is the right procedure and the right way to go
7407843 the only thing i talked with michael about was his new challenge moving forward in his new assignment and he was very excited about that
7407844 obviously he loves the giants and obviously he is working for fox
7407845 right now he is relaxing and getting ready for his fox gig
7407846 i havent talked to any of the players or to kiwi or anyone this afternoon and until i do that i will just refrain from any thoughts about what might happen within our team
7407847 i think the number one thing that brings frustration anxiety and knots in your stomach all the things that go along with the injury to the players which do not allow your team to function as it is presented on paper
7407848 those types of things are very difficult for coaches no matter what age you are
7407849 therapeutic benefits of swimming for a dog is tremendous swimming allows the dog to exercise without impact on their joints and provides a thorough workout
7407850 s 10h30 o fogo foi completamente apagado pela brigada de bombeiros da central
7407851 n o teve impacto algum sobre os trabalhadores ou o meio ambiente
7407852 aconteceu na parte comum da usina longe do n cleo do reator e foi controlado com recursos pr prios em dez minutos
7407853 you know mom i kind of like it when there arent any pictures that way i dont have to think like the author thinks
7407854 mike while i concede that i am perhaps not exactly in the right state of mind to be making sweeping generalizations right now i am learning heavily towards never doing this again
7407855 some of the best mountain biking trails in southern ontario
7407856 im still too new ive worked with the most intelligent actors in this country like amitabh bachchan om puri and aamir khan right now i feel very special because ive someone like waheeda rehman on the sets she is too special for me to differentiate intelligence of all these wonderful actors would be presumptuous my journey has been too short
7407857 after i put together a larger perspective maybe i can comment better theyre all super accomplished im not being diplomatic im as nervous directing abhishek bachchan today in delhi 6 as i was when i directed his father in aks id say every actor from raveena tandon to sonam kapoor has added to my learning curve im always learning from my actors
7407858 it would have to be mr amitabh bachchan he brings decades of his experience on the table and yet he never allows it to show in his performances when i was doing black with him on many occasions he would be able to understand a scene fully even before i had explained it and then hed take it much further than where i thought it would go the hallmark of a truly intelligent actor is that he never allows the baggage of his wisdom and experience to weigh down his performance amitji can interpret a scene in a hundred ways but finally he knows which is the best way to deal with a moment
7407859 the way he would show sudden fits of absolute forgetfulness as an alzheimer patient in black still gives me goose bumps id give anything to work with him again
7407860 it is very hard to single out any one actor anil kapoor om puri and shabana azmi are all highly intelligent kareena kapoor has an instinctive intelligence shabana seeks out a context to every part she understands a part cerebrally and then gets emotionally attached to it chitrangada singh is stunning on the first day of shooting of hazaaron khwaishein aisi i was talking to her like a child on the last day i spoke to her as though she was naseeruddin shah
7407861 naseer is the most fantastically intelligent actor ive worked with and he doesnt let the preparation show on screen he was in my first film yeh woh manzil to nahin everything i know about acting came from watching him in front of the camera naseer taught me theres no generic rule for acting every actor is different you need to hit the right notes
7407862 currently kay kay menon continues to be a surprise a lot of people say things about shiney ahuja but hes very focused with me does commercial success spoil actors it didnt spoil aamir khan or saif ali khan saif works with a very rare intelligence he creates characters without fuss
7407863 therere so many super intelligent actors amitabh bachchan hrithik roshan and shah rukh khan know exactly what theyre doing mr bachchan can make the most stupid scene look convincing sadly many brilliant actors choose stardom above talent
7407864 ive worked with two major actors amitabh bachchan and akshay kumar no one has the creative intelligence of mr bachchan he keeps things very simple while shooting ill be the heart you be the brain he says on the sets he takes instructions carefully then adds subtle tones to it
7407865 but as for knowing what would work with the audience theres no one to beat akshay big films that he said wont work didnt akshay knows when something is missing in a scene at the last minute hell do something to make the scene more interesting he can actually see the audience reacting to a scene while shooting it when we were shooting namastey london in punjab he suddenly came up with the idea of wearing sunglasses in his own house when i questioned him on it he said it was because his character wanted to impress the girl
7407866 as for my wife shefali shah she transforms before camera she applies another kind of intelligence to her characters quite different from amitji and akshay
7407867 ive worked with some of the most intelligent actors in the industry from hrithik roshan and kareena kapoor in mujhse dosti karoge saif ali khan and rani mukerji in hum tum and thoda pyaar thoda magic aamir khan kajol and tabu in fanaa its very difficult to apply any uniform yardstick of intelligence to all these wonderful actors
7407868 ive always been an aamir fan even when i was a journalist when i finally got a chance to direct him i was able to bring aamir together with an actress he had never been paired with kajol and aamir are supposed to be such different actors
7407869 hello whos the adult here you dont put your six year old son in charge of the baby you do it yourself my gosh am i the only adult around here cant i trust you to handle anything
7407870 i have a job interview here in a few minutes
7407871 im terribly worried about how to make a good impression and i was wondering if you could pop by a few minutes into it and act as if you know me
7407872 hey jack didnt want to interrupt wonderful seeing you again
7407873 they will have to answer before the law kaya ho kelangan at nanawagan kami kay chairman murad na kung maaari either dadalhin niya sa gobyerno at ipaubaya niya sa justice system natin yung pagpa implement ng ating batas for them to answer those crimes thats why we are calling on chairman murad to either bring them to the government and let the justice system deal with our laws implementation for them to answer to those crimes
7407874 or if he cannot do it hes not capable of controlling his people or bringing them in then he should stand aside with his forces if they still believe that we can still work towards a peaceful settlement
7407875 sana naman yung mga milf commanders na hindi kasama dito sa pananaw ni umbra kato ay wag makialam dahil ho pag nagpagitna rin sila e they will be lumped up as one by our military and our pnp we hope milf commanders not involved with umbra kato will not interfere if they get in the middle they will be lumped up as one by our military and our pnp
7407876 ang grupo nila umbra kato at ni bravo at ibang kasamahan nila na gumawa ng terorismo have committed terrorist activities the milf as an organization as you know from the positions that they are taking now must be very clear that they are not tolerating itong ginawa nitong mga kumander po nila the group of umbra kato and their allies committed terrorist activies the milf as an organization as you know from the positions that they are taking now must be very clear that they are not tolerating the actions of their commanders
7407877 if they show that they are tolerating this this can be construed as their support to terrorist activities and of course how can we continue peace negotiations with a group that tolerates terrorism
7407878 with due respects to many of them they are no longer fighting government pero may mga iilan pa dyan na lumalaban at nagbibigay ng problema sa atin especially those ni sulu because firearms are still in the hands of rebels so i think we should review this paradigm itong policy na ito there are still a few who remain fighting and giving the government problems
7407879 kelangan po magsipag usap tayo sa mga rebelde kasama diyan ang disarmament provision otherwise there will be no sustainable peace in mindanao we need to talk to rebels and that should include a disarmament provision
7407880 kung meron man tayong resumption ng talks palagay mo the environment is ready for the resumption of the peace talks it is very important that we put up at front as a framework of negotiation disarmament
7407881 mais comment puis je mettre mon nom dans la barre de menu de mac os

7407891 no crecimiento de los salarios podr a llevar a una cierta conflictividad
7407892 no se puede querer imputar el peso de la situaci n exclusivamente a los salarios
7407893 con que se congele el sueldo de los ministros y de los altos cargos pero este mensaje no se le puede trasladar a una persona que cobra 1 000 euros al mes porque ya est haciendo un sacrificio cada d a
7407894 no se puede querer imputar el peso de la situaci n exclusivamente a los salarios
7407895 hay empresas que est n registrando balances con unos beneficios muy potentes y por tanto habr que hacer sacrificios en las dos direcciones
7407896 el sector financiero prejubile a una persona con 52 a os y un trabajador que est trabajando en el andamio tenga que estar trabajando hasta los 65 a os

7407899 deadly confirmation that a hard core cpusa member frank marshall davis played a key role in helping raise barack obama
7407900 no lo conozco pero escuch que rudy ulloa el choferata de kirchner anda con 100 palos verdes y lo quiere comprar
7407901 it seemed to us that since we had finally brought down soviet communism and seen the birth of democracy in russia the most important thing to do was to help russian democracy take root and integrate russia into europe wasnt that why we fought the cold war to give young russians the same chance at freedom and integration with the west as young czechs georgians and poles wasnt consolidating a democratic russia more important than bringing the czech navy into nato
7407902 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is sic going to solve the sectarian violence there
7407903 by and large whats left of the insurgency is just trying to hang on
7407904 the simple fact is that sending in over 20 000 additional troops isnt the answer in fact its a tragic mistake
7407905 it wont deter terrorists who have a completely different agenda it wont rein in the militias
7407906 the group will focus on education religion and social justice
7407907 the surge was designed to give the iraqi government time to take steps to ensure a political solution
7407908 this war is lost and the surge is not accomplishing anything
7407909 the united states is now winning the war that two years ago seemed lost
7407910 in baghdad parks are filled every weekend with families playing and picnicking with their children that was unthinkable only a year ago

7407926 he esperado unos minutos dentro del coche para ver si se pod a reparar pero una vez han evaluado los da os los mec nicos no ten amos posibilidad alguna
7407927 creo que hemos merecido ganar la medalla de oro porque hemos hecho un trabajo incre ble si no llega a ser por los rbitros en vez de la medalla de plata tendr amos la de oro
7407928 si les pitan los pasos que hacen la defensa con manos que hacen y pitan todo est claro que hubi semos podido ganar perfectamente hemos estado a tres puntos a pesar de los rbitros y si hubiesen estado bien seguro que hubi semos ganado pero claramente
7407929 si los rbitros hubiesen aplicado las reglas fiba hubi semos ganado pero estamos muy satisfechos por haber ganado la plata
7407930 era un partido para disfrutar y as ha sido hemos salido a la cancha sin miedo a nadie y no ten amos nada que perder creo que nos vamos muy satisfechos por el trabajo
7407931 el equipo ha demostrado que se crece en los momentos importantes y hoy ha sido as
7407932 se lo he comunicado a los compa eros ha sido un partidazo y no hay mejor despedida posible
7407933 cuando fernando tome una decisi n sobre su futuro se esclarecer n otros muchos asuntos todo el mundo sabe que la continuidad en renault depende de que se empiecen a lograr buenos resultados

7407935 el partido ha sido espectacular eeuu tiene un equipo de una gran fuerza f sica y son muy veloces nosotros con talento y ganas estuvimos en el partido hasta el final el partido ha sido bueno para el baloncesto
7407936 est claro que es un jugador de los m s potentes que tenemos y cuando juegas contra eeuu que tienen una potencia extraordinaria
7407937 no hay ninguna campa a de publicidad que pueda pagar ninguna administraci n auton mica ni nacional en la que se consiga un impacto medi tico similar al que se logra con una prueba de estas caracter sticas
7407938 fuerza y de capacidad de organizar acontecimientos de mucha complejidad como es un gran premio de f rmula 1 que se ha podido ver en decenas de cadenas televisivas de todo el mundo
7407939 este partido dice mucho de nosotros y de lo merecedores que somos de esta medalla se nos escap es una l stima pero estamos muy contentos
7407940 fue un partido bonito de jugar lo tuvimos muy cerca tuvimos opciones durante todo el partido
7407941 la diferencia fue la mentalidad nunca nos vimos derrotados que fue el error del primer partido donde nos falt chispa y confianza
7407942 no es igual un partido en la fase de grupos que una final pero estoy muy orgulloso y satisfecho
7407943 creo que s lo existe un dream team otros equipos puedes estar cerca del dream team
7407944 eeuu se tom muy en serio el torneo y trabajaron duro tuvieron que trabajar muy duro para conseguir el oro
7407945 madman it was a vile thing to write and instead of simply apologizing for it mr stoller decided to dodge and weave and construct straw men arguments about what i said

7407951 it is in truth not for glory nor riches nor honours that we are fighting but for freedom for that alone which no honest man gives up but with life itself
7407952 the underlying facts in this case are just too serious why should this defendant who made this type of claim be able to just walk away
7407953 she didnt make it back to the party and received a phone call wondering where she was
7407954 when she finally arrived at the party with no money and no crack she said she was scared and told the people she was stopped by police
7407955 shes going to choose the pressure of the law over the pressure of her family the next time
7407956 while ladds charges fall under the scope of crimes eligible to be addressed through accelerated rehabilitation dearstyne said ladds claims had a profound financial and social impact on the southington police department
7407957 the claim was made and to some degree remnants of that claim remain out there whether its in the southington police department or the community
7407958 these are accusations that stayed within the southington community for months each and every one of those patrol officers and detectives in southington were affected
7407959 para ser competitivos tenemos que apostar por el turismo y por la oferta de viviendas de segunda residencia porque la gente si viene a galicia es por su costa no a comer pimientos de padr n

7407980 till 2003 only a small percentage around three fourth of one percent of indian papers were written in collaboration with chinese authors
7407981 there has been a slow but perceptible rise in collaboration
7407982 the number of indo chinese papers has steadily increased over these eight years from 124 in 2000 to 361 in 2007
7407983 multidisciplinary physics physics of particles and fields astronomy and astrophysics nuclear physics and applied physics top the list with 468 189 181 83 and 59 papers respectively

7407987 many people didnt know that in tata sky sky stands for the company which is the biggest player in dth technology in the world market

7407989 in view of the dilly dallying tactics of the government on the issue the samiti has decided to continue its agitation and so it extended the bandh upto august 31
7407990 i feel this is amitabhs best performance he was the obvious choice for the role
7407991 amitabh suited the role of the ageing theatre actor perfectly i dont think anyone would have fitted the bill so well he is so eccentric performs so brilliantly and the way he speaks english is so impeccable and clear i feel he is the crowning glory of the film
7407992 rituparno ghosh creates magic out of relationship based cinema i dont think anyone would have treated the script the way he has done it
7407993 this film is in english and anyone who understands the language can enjoy it it imparts undertones of various messages and talks in particular of the conflict between theatre and cinema
7407994 i love watching a film like om shanti om but i know there are better people who are making such masala and romantic films now more intelligent and meaningful stories need to be told even mithya was such a film
7407995 the last lear is a niche film and so it was required to be shown internationally before being brought it to india it has already travelled to film festivals in toronto rome and london
7407996 when we thought of releasing the film around the summer vacations this year the ipl indian premier league matches were on and there were also a lot of big films packed till now we wanted to release it at a decent time when there wont be many commercial films to compete with
7407997 singh is kinng has turned out to be a huge success i think it will also help our film as seeing a trailer in a theatre is very different from seeing it on tv the theatrical trailer definitely has more impact and also generates more curiosity in the audience

7408001 the persistently gloomy outlook for the us economy and oil demand and spread of the economic downturn from the us to europe is weighing on prices
7408002 also as the us dollar gains strength the oil pricing comes down so the movement in the us dollar is also driving oil in the short term
7408003 no puedo quejarme por este segundo puesto esta carrera ha sido complicada para m porque he tenido algunos problemas de salud gastroenteritis que me han impedido estar al cien por cien

7408161 but we dont want to show it we try our best to look like all the rest we understand we are not anywhere near the level of the other competitors here we understand that very very well but more than anything else we would like to show the dignity of ourselves and our country

7408223 saya merasa bahwa dr afia mungkin dipulangkan ke pakistan segera mungkin sebelum 3 september atau segera sesudahnya
7408224 ini mungkin angan angan tapi harapan itu sedikit dikitnya menguatkan keluarga kami
7408225 adalah hal yang cukup aneh bagaimana kita menyerahkan saudara perempuan kita kepada non muslim laki laki yang sejarahnya penuh perkosaan dan perlakuan sewenang wenang kepada tahanan
7408226 the use of a computer for distribution and exhibition rather than with production
7408227 whenever i really try to do that it doesnt seem to work very well
7408228 but theres a pile there and i know a little bit more about a couple of them than the other ones ive got to see more so thats what were trying to do whether we can or not well see
7408229 so thats good its a gauge as to where our players are
7408230 the chargers secondary is considered one of the best in the league
7408231 theyre a real physical bunch so im looking forward to it
7408232 thats my main thing as long as im coming out and doing my job in practice and in the games the balls will come so im not worried about that
7408233 randy went down and everybody was thinking what are we going to do now
7408234 but there really isnt too much pressure on them they might think ah the entire city is counting on us to pick up the load
7408235 but realistically the defenses and cornerbacks theyre facing dont know too much about them is anyone going to double and triple cover courtney and ben probably not
7408236 so theyve got a great chance to exploit this situation
7408237 with the injury i have nobody would prefer that somebody really play
7408238 but right now i can play its a high risk i could injure it further but its hard i want to be on the field
7408239 dogs possess the capacity for a rudimentary form of empathy
7408240 its going to be a way of life i dont think there is any turning back
7408241 it is not from the benevolence of the butcher the brewer or the baker that we expect our dinner but from their regard to their own self interest we address ourselves not to their humanity but to their self love and never talk to them of our own neccessities but of their advantages
7408242 i dont pray about the wart i pray for forgiveness for consulting a dermatologist
7408243 humans tend to be attracted to those with a dissimilar genetic make up to themselves maintaining genetic diversity
7408244 but without enough state money saxton said the county might have to depend on volunteers and civilians to combat the menace
7408245 this plant just seems to take over the grass lands
7408246 ive still got the scar its like a second degree burn
7408247 in the past three years it has gone from hardly being noticed to a full blown invasion
7408248 my feet swelled up and it looked like i had web feet for a while
7408249 nobody remembers any autistic children in somalia im sure there must have been some but there were not that many
7408250 we have a condition that has no known cause and there is no cure and people are looking to us to provide them with answers
7408251 not only is it high among us here but we somalis dont accept this disorder
7408252 the parents feel like it is something that has happened to their children here
7408253 what were trying to do is find out if it is true that theres this alarming incidence
7408254 we dont have a blood test or a lab test to say you have autism so its somewhat subjective
7408255 the bottom line is that we dont have enough information
7408256 we know that more children are diagnosed today than in the past
7408257 a lot of it is the change in what we call autism but we cant say that explains all of it
7408258 we certainly get indications that autism exists in other communities of the world
7408259 but whether it exists to the same degree as common its not quite as clear
7408260 so why arent you wearing your wee sweatshirt this morning mr man
7408261 por esse mesmo tempo o senhor separou a tribo de levi para levar a arca da alian a do senhor para estar diante do senhor para o servir e para aben oar em seu nome at ao dia de hoje pelo que levi n o tem parte nem heran a com seus irm os o senhor a sua heran a como o senhor teu deus lhe tem prometido
7408262 it would be nice to just have the measuring device on the spice containers
7408263 if theres anything more important than my ego around i want it caught and shot now
7408264 ive been thinking about this for years and ive finally identified a consultant and partners who can move it forward
7408265 im ready to roll the big question is given my assets how should i fund the thing
7408266 gee i really wish adv would release some of their mediocre older series in thinpak form
7408267 ive watched caseys career from the time he first came in and hes always impressed me
7408268 i think i was pulling for you about as hard as i was for our cars
7408269 im a team player and thats how i like to race
7408270 im just starting to get to know a taurus whats are the flaws associated with this sign i want to be ready
7408271 georgienkriget f r stora f ljder f r b de st och v stv rlden
7408272 om jag haft ett visningsex skulle jag ha s lt 50 bilar
7408273 there are a lot of pieces coming together at the same time
7408274 while that is daunting and frightening in some regards it represents an opportunity to freshen the view and the conversation and solutions that might be required
7408275 whenever you lose top leadership like that you lose a certain amount of institutional memory
7408276 it certainly has changed from a school where 99 percent were white that was 15 years ago to a school with a wonderful blend of ethnicities and races
7408277 teachers are so used to huge changes because we get new kids and new parents every year
7408278 yeah your 16 years old and want to fuck i wont ask for id
7408279 de groep van sociaal onaangepasten met psychische problemen neemt snel toe
7408280 deze mensen zijn niet inzetbaar op de arbeidsmarkt zelfs niet in de projecten van de sociale economie ze zijn levenslang veroordeeld tot het minimum van het leefloon 640 euro voor alleenstaanden en 850 voor samenwonenden
7408281 nu springt het vlaams fonds alleen bij voor mensen met een fysieke handicap en met zware psychische problemen het lijkt me billijk dat ook mensen met psychische problemen en sociale disfuncties in aanmerking komen voor zon statuut
7408282 stop dus met belgische staatshervormingen het is tijd voor vlaamse staatsvorming
7408283 de keuze voor een onafhankelijk vlaanderen is geen keuze voor een chaotisch avontuur want belgi is juist de chaos in vlaanderen zijn de politieke en administratieve structuren aanwezig voor een ordentelijke overgang van belgi naar vlaanderen op geen enkele wijze kunnen franstaligen in de rand rond brussel aanspraak maken op het statuut van nationale minderheid het onafhankelijk vlaanderen moet waar mogelijk met nederland de krachten bundelen om samen in europa en de wereld een rol van betekenis te spelen
7408284 belgi is morsdood maar ik waarschuw voor de perfide reanimatiepogingen van de nepbelgicisten die de passie van het confederalisme gaan prediken vlaanderen mag niet zich laten opsluiten in een deelstaat die niets anders is dan een soort onderstaat in een opgelapte bovenstaat belgi is geen optie meer verleden tijd
7408285 dat veronderstelt respect van de franstaligen het taalimperialisme de pogingen tot gebiedsuitbreiding en de boycot van de vlaamse staat moeten stoppen in brussel moet de taalwet worden toegepast
7408286 samen met mijn vriendin en een aantal vrienden kwamen we net buiten uit zaal rubens in de dorpstraat
7408287 we hadden ons allemaal goed geamuseerd en we genoten nog na de meesten van ons gezelschap hadden hun auto op de markt geparkeerd vlakbij de dorpsfontein toen we de rijweg overstaken kwam uit de richting van lier een bestelwagen aangereden de chauffeur stopte maar riep wel dat we wat moesten voortmaken het ging hem allemaal wat te traag toen we waren overgestoken reed hij verder maar plots stopte hij weer en begon ons uit te kafferen
7408288 ik geef toe we hadden allemaal wat gedronken en iedereen riep wat terug hoe gaat zoiets maar plots sprongen die twee uit hun wagen en kwamen recht op ons toe gestapt er werd wat geduwd en getrokken toen is een van hen naar zijn voertuig gewandeld om een stok te pakken ik kreeg ik een zware klap op mijn hoofd het werd zwart voor mijn ogen en ik ben bewusteloos op de grond gevallen
7408289 ik werd wakker door het geroep ik zag het slachtoffer op de grond liggen en daarnaast een vrouw die luidkeels om hulp riep wat verder stond de dader nog met een lange stok in zijn hand terwijl iedereen zich om het slachtoffer bekommerde stapten de twee mannen naar hun auto en reden weg nog voor de politie toekwam
7408290 de fazanten waren in zeer slechte toestand logisch als je er zoveel samen in n hok zet
7408291 normaal gezien moet je speciale kapjes gebruiken omdat de vogels elkaar anders gewoon doodpikken er was dan ook geen enkele fazant die nog staartpluimen of rugveren had ook het voedsel voor de vogels was beneden alle peil
7408292 wij vangen ze op totdat het parket zegt wat we ermee moeten doen loslaten in de natuur is geen optie dat is bij wet verboden waarschijnlijk worden ze geslacht en gaat de opbrengst naar de staatskas of gaat het vlees naar de ocmws zelf ben ik voorstander om de fazanten onder ge nteresseerde particulieren te verdelen
7408293 we zijn klaar om de competitie in te stappen het echte werk kan nu beginnen
7408294 neither passenger nor goods trains were allowed to move from stations
7408295 protesters damaged at least five vehicles two in rourkela and three in the coastal district of balasore
7408296 curfew will not be lifted for 2 3 days and no one will be allowed to march towards lal chowk on monday
7408297 people will defy the curfew to join the sit in at lal chowk
7408298 for the first time in my adult life i am proud of my country
7408299 you know there there are some things that even i dont know and what michelle is going to wear is a tightly held secret
7408300 the glory goes to the olympic family to athletes who have competed hard to volunteers from different parts of the world and to friends the world over who have been involved in the beijing olympic games in various ways
7408301 the most intangible legacy but also very important one is that through the games china has been scrutinized by the world has opened up to the world
7408302 the world has learned about china and china has learned about the world i believe this is something that will have positive effects in the long term
7408303 a grand event of international sports competition and cultural exchanges
7408304 the chinese people have greeted all the guests with great enthusiasm and shared with people from across the world the joy and happiness
7408305 the success of the beijing olympic games is attributable to the concerted efforts of the chinese people and people from the rest of the world
7408306 thanks to the efforts by the villages service team we have received 49 compliment letters and no complaints
7408307 de kloof tussen belgi en de andere landen is groter geworden er wacht ons een oceaan van werk voor de spelen van 2012
7408308 wij hadden geen vast aantal medailles vooropgesteld en de twee medailles van de slotdagen mogen niet dienen als bomen die het bos verbergen het waren schitterende medailles maar we gingen er van uit dat de helft van onze atleten in de top acht zou eindigen helaas we hebben dat doel niet bereikt in een aantal sporten hebben we niet de verwachte resultaten gehaald we hebben hard gewerkt na athene maar de kloof met het wereldniveau is alleen groter geworden deze spelen zijn een wake up call voor al onze atleten ze moeten uit hun bed springen de belgische sport moet resultaten brengen in 2012 en 2016 we moeten eind dit jaar al beleidsplannen en concrete afspreken hebben met alle sportfederaties voor de komende vier jaar anders is het te laat
7408309 we hebben hier veel verantwoordelijken over de vloer gehad en het is mij vooral opgevallen hoezeer ze bewust zijn geworden van een goed sportbeleid
7408310 ze staken door het rood de straat over en waren iedereen aan het uitdagen
7408311 ik zag aan hun ogen dat ze niet in orde waren zonder aanleiding duwden ze ons plots langs achter tegen de grond een van hen hield ons in bedwang en de andere stampte op onze hoofden minutenlang pas toen een vrachtwagenchauffeur stopte en door zijn raampje riep dat ze moesten ophouden zijn ze weggelopen zelfs zonder onze gsm of ons geld
7408312 al bij al valt het nog mee maar die jongens zijn er echt dagen niet goed van geweest
7408313 het agressieve duo is bekend bij de politie voor onder meer drugsdelicten en slagen en verwondingen
7408314 met een geitje leggen we samen met 24 andere teams een tocht van ongeveer 9 000 kilometer af door afrika
7408315 begin november vertrekken we in brussel om een maand later aan te komen aan de kust in benin
7408316 onderweg steken we het atlasgebergte over en doorkruisen we de jungle en de westelijke sahara en dat alles natuurlijk in onze citro n 2 pk het zal geen simpele opgave zijn maar gelukkig is het geen snelheidswedstrijd in deze avonturentocht moeten onderweg tal van opdrachten en raadsels opgelost worden met de bedoeling de landen beter te leren kennen op vlak van natuur cultuur en geschiedenis centraal staan avontuur teambuilding en 200 fun
7408317 ondertussen is ons geitje gerestaureerd en klaargestoomd voor het grote avontuur we hebben hier en daar wat verstevigingen aangebracht maar verder is alles origineel en hopen we dat deze 2 pk motor ons 9 000 kilometer verder zal brengen door de woeste natuur
7408318 finding artefacts such as this one during experiments is not uncommon but we decided to investigate this one further since we kept observing it over and over when we sequenced it we were surprised to learn that we had found a new virus
7408319 in theory we could use this virus to produce a lethal toxin in the mosquito or instruct the mosquito to die after 10 days which is before it can transmit the malaria parasite to humans however these concepts are many years away
7408320 weve been told that mcclure is going to run some races next year and to us especially me as a car owner we know how much car numbers mean to teams and organizations
7408321 even though nascar has given us that number for next year if mr mcclure is going to run a car were excited to have him back in the series so we wanted him to have his number as a fellow car owner i know how important that would be to me so we wanted to make sure that hes got his number back for next year with the word that hes going to be running some races next year
7408322 its one of those deals where i couldnt get by him i couldnt get by him and i just had to ask myself would he do that to me and he has before so thats the way it goes
7408323 they fans and media keep talking about rivalries we might have one now
7408324 michael waltrip is the worst race car driver in nasa signed him on again
7408325 i just ate so my kung fu may not be as good as later on
7408326 bristol is my kind of track you bump you grind and just battle for 500 grueling laps its a blast
7408327 i was just really loose getting into one and two the car slipped up the track and i had to catch it
7408328 i dont know it looked to me like the 5 and 55 got together everybody is running so close after the restart that it just looks like theres nowhere for anybody to go once that all breaks loose i just wish that the mobil 1 dodge you know had been able to make it to the end it just looked like everybody kind of got together everybody was pushing each other real hard not a lot of room out there and when everybody gets together and runs that tight you know you get one car sideways and theres not a whole lot of room for everybody to go yeah were running at a half mile were running on some of the slower speeds that were going to run all year long but when things start to happen theres not a whole lot of time to make adjustments for it
7408329 we were dead equal clint and i i knew i needed a break and he gave it to me all i can do is force him to run hard and he made a mistake im lucky
7408330 i just cant believe it i just got loose down there and made a mistake and gave it away
7408331 its appropriate that we had the call of duty game on the gamestop car tonight because it certainly was a war out there
7408332 thats one of those deals where i couldnt get by him and i couldnt get by him and i just had to ask myself would he do that to me
7408333 and he has before so thats the way it goes
7408334 all i could think about was richmond in a nationwide race when he was trying to get through the field and he pile drove me thats just the way it is i have a lot of respect for the guy and he was real fast but we cant give up points when theyre right there for us to take
7408335 so i got into him a little bit and let him know that i didnt appreciate the way he passed me
7408336 hell always come back and say hes sorry he did it at milwaukee with clint bowyer and hes done it a few other times its just his normal fashion thats fine
7408337 he was mad and i can completely empathize with his anger
7408338 i probably would have done the exact same thing if i were in his position if i could have passed busch without running into him thats what i would have done
7408339 were looking forward to another great lester buildings promotion at tri city speedway
7408340 the first two lester contests at boone county raceway in nebraska on july 21 and eriez speedway in hammett pa on july 27 were big successes so were expecting a bunch of fans to stop by the lester buildings display again this weekend
7408341 it was nice to get a top five at bulls gap but that was just circumstances more than anything we qualified good 10th fastest in time trials and second in a heat and started up front third so we ended up with a good finish
7408342 the other two nights we didnt qualify well and that put us behind for the rest of the deal the tracks we were on were tough to pass on so when we didnt qualify up front we didnt get a good finish
7408343 because you do a job that not very many people want to do it lowers the life expectancy you get paid nothing and well no one really likes you very much
7408344 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
7408345 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
7408346 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters now is who uses that language for what purpose
7408347 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
7408348 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
7408349 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
7408350 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
7408351 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
7408352 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
7408353 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
7408354 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
7408355 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
7408356 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
7408357 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
7408358 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
7408359 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
7408360 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
7408361 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
7408362 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
7408363 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
7408364 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
7408365 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
7408366 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
7408367 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
7408368 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
7408369 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
7408370 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
7408371 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
7408372 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
7408373 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
7408374 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
7408375 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
7408376 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
7408377 politics depends to a great extent on judging what is actual relative to what is possible however we have an inherently weak grasp of what is possible and most societies are not set up so as naturally to improve this or to make us aware of possibilities we may have ignored or taken with insufficient seriousness
7408378 really demonstrate to this party and the american people where they are with obamas candidacy
7408379 its clear they dont want an on air roll call theyre extremely nervous about this she said
7408380 japanese soldiers in the south pacific still fighting after the war is over
7408381 how many quarterbacks can say they threw in front of norm chow i thought i did real well
7408382 i remember the things troy aikman could do i want to emulate that and take them back to the top
7408383 when no one else is working you have to get better
7408384 the first knock was they didnt think he was 6 2 but now hes almost 6 3
7408385 he wants the ball in crunch time you could tell in the huddle how the kids responded to him as a sophomore there was a difference when he took over
7408386 hes done it more than one day hes done it time after time hes certainly worthy of being considered one of the top quarterbacks coming out i think hes a tremendous quarterback and has a sunday type of future if everything plays out
7408387 i had to do my best when coaches came out
7408388 we definitely worked for the game and well take the win
7408389 wins are hard to earn and our hard work got us the result tonight give credit to loyola we expected a tough game and loyola came out and played very determined
7408390 for us it was tough to get a good rhythm at the start but it was kind of expected due to the turnover in our squad i thought as the game went on we played better we possessed better and our spacing was better
7408391 kellys goal was very opportunistic from the standpoint of taking the shot and having it deflected in the goal as the game went on we played a lot better and created opportunities
7408392 i was shocked by the news and obviously caught off guard having initially heard through one of my assistants his intent on friday night and then having it confirmed over the last 36 hours
7408393 he had a great summer in workouts and did well academically having said that we want people here who are completely committed to being part of our program our institution and our family we all wish trevor the best of luck
7408394 i convinced myself im the best putter in the world
7408395 i came out here with a different attitude and i putted great this week
7408396 you cant take it the wrong way i think the most important thing about it is that i keep putting myself in a good position unfortunately somebody just seems to be able to come up with some spectacular playing
7408397 if this is the letter a and the next 3 parameters are omitted the active window will be used
7408398 if this is the letter a and the next 3 parameters are omitted the active window will be used
7408399 het was de bedoeling om vorig jaar al over te gaan tot de afbouw van onze tijdelijke werknemers
7408400 omwille van het verkoopssucces dat tegen de algemene trend in europa ingaat zijn die mensen nog een tijdje langer aan de slag kunnen blijven
7408401 er worden inderdaad zo een duizend wagens op jaarbasis minder geproduceerd maar dat is eigenlijk peanuts in verhouding met de huidige productie dagelijks rollen er bij ford genk meer dan 1 300 wagens van de band
7408402 maandag vandaag red is het ondernemingsraad en ik verwacht dat dit nieuws dan ook aan ons zal meegedeeld worden maar men mag dit niet overroepen het was zo gepland
7408403 door wat die lomperiken gedaan hebben lijkt het alsof we in een probleemwijk wonen
7408404 maar het zijn slechts enkelingen die het voor de rest verzieken er gebeurt wel eens wat kattenkwaad maar waar niet
7408405 nu sturen ze al het leger op ons af zoals berlusconi zou doen
7408406 maar met dat samenscholingsverbod lijkt het nu alsof ze de schuld steken op alle jongeren die wel eens op straat samenkomen
7408407 hier gebeurt nooit iets veel klachten over geluidsoverlast dat kan maar misschien wordt er soms ook wat snel geklaagd en die tolerantie zal nu alleen maar minderen
7408408 wij komen graag samen op straat maar dat is niet omdat er hier niets te doen is
7408409 het jeugdhuis doet hier uitstekend werk net als de chiro de speelpleinwerking en het jeugdwerk dat mag je door dat ene voorval niet zomaar vergeten
7408410 wij vinden het samenscholingsverbod nodig maar het is belachelijk dat het maar tot twee straten wordt beperkt
7408411 maar hier is wel degelijk meer aan de hand dan die brandstichting geluidsoverlast vandalisme maar ook diefstallen het wordt almaar erger
7408412 samen met mijn vriendin en een aantal vrienden kwamen we net buiten uit zaal rubens in de dorpstraat
7408413 we hadden ons allemaal goed geamuseerd en we genoten nog na de meesten van ons gezelschap hadden hun auto op de markt geparkeerd vlakbij de dorpsfontein toen we de rijweg overstaken kwam uit de richting van lier een bestelwagen aangereden de chauffeur stopte maar riep wel dat we wat moesten voortmaken het ging hem allemaal wat te traag toen we waren overgestoken reed hij verder maar plots stopte hij weer en begon ons uit te kafferen
7408414 ik geef toe we hadden allemaal wat gedronken en iedereen riep wat terug hoe gaat zoiets maar plots sprongen die twee uit hun wagen en kwamen recht op ons toe gestapt er werd wat geduwd en getrokken toen is een van hen naar zijn voertuig gewandeld om een stok te pakken ik kreeg ik een zware klap op mijn hoofd het werd zwart voor mijn ogen en ik ben bewusteloos op de grond gevallen
7408415 ik werd wakker door het geroep ik zag het slachtoffer op de grond liggen en daarnaast een vrouw die luidkeels om hulp riep wat verder stond de dader nog met een lange stok in zijn hand terwijl iedereen zich om het slachtoffer bekommerde stapten de twee mannen naar hun auto en reden weg nog voor de politie toekwam

7408417 stop dus met belgische staatshervormingen het is tijd voor vlaamse staatsvorming
7408418 de keuze voor een onafhankelijk vlaanderen is geen keuze voor een chaotisch avontuur want belgi is juist de chaos in vlaanderen zijn de politieke en administratieve structuren aanwezig voor een ordentelijke overgang van belgi naar vlaanderen op geen enkele wijze kunnen franstaligen in de rand rond brussel aanspraak maken op het statuut van nationale minderheid het onafhankelijk vlaanderen moet waar mogelijk met nederland de krachten bundelen om samen in europa en de wereld een rol van betekenis te spelen
7408419 belgi is morsdood maar ik waarschuw voor de perfide reanimatiepogingen van de nepbelgicisten die de passie van het confederalisme gaan prediken vlaanderen mag niet zich laten opsluiten in een deelstaat die niets anders is dan een soort onderstaat in een opgelapte bovenstaat belgi is geen optie meer verleden tijd
7408420 dat veronderstelt respect van de franstaligen het taalimperialisme de pogingen tot gebiedsuitbreiding en de boycot van de vlaamse staat moeten stoppen in brussel moet de taalwet worden toegepast
7408421 we zijn klaar om de competitie in te stappen het echte werk kan nu beginnen
7408422 de fazanten waren in zeer slechte toestand logisch als je er zoveel samen in n hok zet
7408423 normaal gezien moet je speciale kapjes gebruiken omdat de vogels elkaar anders gewoon doodpikken er was dan ook geen enkele fazant die nog staartpluimen of rugveren had ook het voedsel voor de vogels was beneden alle peil
7408424 wij vangen ze op totdat het parket zegt wat we ermee moeten doen loslaten in de natuur is geen optie dat is bij wet verboden waarschijnlijk worden ze geslacht en gaat de opbrengst naar de staatskas of gaat het vlees naar de ocmws zelf ben ik voorstander om de fazanten onder ge nteresseerde particulieren te verdelen
7408425 dit was voor ons een van de hoogtepunten van dit jaar
7408426 de regisseur heeft me daarnet zijn definitie van fata morgana toevertrouwd bloed zweet en tranen zei hij en ik denk dat hij gelijk heeft
7408427 omdat het wachten was op tenten en luifels toen die er eindelijk waren hebben we ons uit de naad moeten werken om alles op tijd af te krijgen toen alles klaar stond heb ik me een uur moeten terugtrekken zo opgejaagd was ik maar bij mijn terugkeer zag ik al die koppels op de markt zitten en dacht ik wauw
7408428 er staat n roos in mijn tuin die nooit zal verdwijnen want die tuin is mijn hart en die roos dat ben jij
7408429 maar ik heb tot op het laatste moment schrik gehad dat de reuzeboot zou kantelen dankzij de duikers van de maaseikse brandweer die m overeind hebben gehouden is dat niet gebeurd
7408430 of dit voor herhaling vatbaar is binnen een half jaar misschien
7408431 het was echt vermoeiend vooral omdat ik de voorbije dagen voortdurend werd aangeklampt ik denk dat ik nu weet wat het betekent om bekend te zijn heel tof hoor maar niet voor lang ze maken je zot lacht
7408432 het is al knap als een ballet van twintig dames synchroon beweegt maar 8 000 amateurs ongelooflijk is dat dit is voor ons het derde hoogtepunt van 2008 eerst was er de winst in zo is er maar n onlangs de radio 2 zomerhit trofee en nu dit misschien wel t meest ontroerende van de drie

7408438 a few of us were talking that its probably a lot bigger than just a regular win given the way the blue jays are playing and that theyre trying to catch up to us
7408439 ik heb zelfs even overwogen om met tennis te kappen
7408440 het was veel erger dan een gewone blokkering mijn ruggengraat draaide niet meer zoals zou moeten ik had geen controle meer over mijn heupen en benen ik heb dit nog niet verteld maar ik heb sinds maart amper kunnen trainen door die rug ik heb alleen wat tornooien afgewerkt het dieptepunt was s hertogenbosch 0 6 0 1 en opgave tegen granollers dat was schandalig om te zien n om te voelen die pijn man niet te doen toen zat ik diep ik heb toen zelfs serieus overwogen om met tennis te kappen
7408441 je mag opnieuw tennissen n trainen zeiden de dokters eindelijk groen licht dat deed deugd
7408442 hopelijk blijft die pijn nu achterwege mijn rug is al een pak beter maar nog niet honderd procent

7408447 de kloof tussen belgi en de andere landen is groter geworden er wacht ons een oceaan van werk voor de spelen van 2012
7408448 wij hadden geen vast aantal medailles vooropgesteld en de twee medailles van de slotdagen mogen niet dienen als bomen die het bos verbergen het waren schitterende medailles maar we gingen er van uit dat de helft van onze atleten in de top acht zou eindigen helaas we hebben dat doel niet bereikt in een aantal sporten hebben we niet de verwachte resultaten gehaald we hebben hard gewerkt na athene maar de kloof met het wereldniveau is alleen groter geworden deze spelen zijn een wake up call voor al onze atleten ze moeten uit hun bed springen de belgische sport moet resultaten brengen in 2012 en 2016 we moeten eind dit jaar al beleidsplannen en concrete afspreken hebben met alle sportfederaties voor de komende vier jaar anders is het te laat
7408449 we hebben hier veel verantwoordelijken over de vloer gehad en het is mij vooral opgevallen hoezeer ze bewust zijn geworden van een goed sportbeleid
7408450 met een geitje leggen we samen met 24 andere teams een tocht van ongeveer 9 000 kilometer af door afrika
7408451 begin november vertrekken we in brussel om een maand later aan te komen aan de kust in benin
7408452 onderweg steken we het atlasgebergte over en doorkruisen we de jungle en de westelijke sahara en dat alles natuurlijk in onze citro n 2 pk het zal geen simpele opgave zijn maar gelukkig is het geen snelheidswedstrijd in deze avonturentocht moeten onderweg tal van opdrachten en raadsels opgelost worden met de bedoeling de landen beter te leren kennen op vlak van natuur cultuur en geschiedenis centraal staan avontuur teambuilding en 200 fun
7408453 ondertussen is ons geitje gerestaureerd en klaargestoomd voor het grote avontuur we hebben hier en daar wat verstevigingen aangebracht maar verder is alles origineel en hopen we dat deze 2 pk motor ons 9 000 kilometer verder zal brengen door de woeste natuur

7408457 these rules were never going to stop all the parties at the conventions everyone and their brother holds receptions at the conventions
7408458 this is a chance for the chamber to meet with a lot of people who dont work in washington and hear their voices
7408459 to showcase the elective process in the best light possible
7408460 to present and display the many leading edge technologies and innovations that we offer
7408461 is proud to support the democratic and republican national conventions
7408462 we make every effort to comply with all state and federal regulations that govern events such as receptions entertainment etc for candidates and elected officials
7408463 largely have failed to make the nominating conventions more respectable political events
7408464 the conventions have become mostly privately financed soirees funded by corporations and lobbying firms that seek favors from the federal government
7408465 unlimited soft money donations from special interests to pay for the conventions and the lavish parties and wining and dining at the conventions run counter to the federal election law and congressional ethics rules

7408477 alright pay attention screw around out here and youll get your head blown off your job is to mark the targets for the people on the firing line when the guy shooting at your target hits it youll see a hole in it got it
7408478 when you see the hole then youll grab the target and pull it down in front of you ok
7408479 then take one of those 4 inch cardboard disks with the wooden peg in the middle and push it in the hole to mark the hit if its in the white ring use the black side of the marker disk if its in the black area of the target use the white side of the disk you there pay attention goddammit or its 200 push ups
7408480 then push the target frame back up so they can see it grab the pole with the metal disk on it and hold it up and wiggle it to signal where they hit one side is black for a hit in the white or show the white side of the disk if the hit is in the black area if they miss then grab the other pole with the red flag on it thats called maggies drawers wave that back and forth and then wait for the next round got it what the fuck are you laughing at

7408490 the main driver is the financials cmc markets senior dealer dominic vaughan said
7408491 were also seeing the resources sector holding up despite a mixed bag of metal prices overnight
7408492 at this stage the market looks like it may remain relatively well bid by the end of the day but it wouldnt surprise me if we did see some profit taking later on
7408493 knows the law so getting in the car is going to be difficult
7408494 first the presence of several air fresheners commonly used to mask the smell of narcotics hanging in the mercedes
7408495 the prior traffic stop of the mercedes in a drug trafficking area branchs evident nervousness the presence of air fresheners and the fact that branch was driving a car not registered to him these factors in combination could form the basis for a reasonable suspicion of narcotics trafficking
7408496 a seizure that is justified solely by the interest in issuing a warning ticket to the driver can become unlawful if it is prolonged beyond the time reasonably required to complete that mission
7408497 in sum there is insufficient evidence to establish the presence of air fresheners and at the very least there was evidence that called into question officer whites wavering testimony in this regard given that most people are nervous when pulled over by police officers officer whites observation that the defendant seemed nervous in conjunction with the defendants reputation as a drug dealer does not in my opinion rise to the level of reasonable articulable suspicion that would justify a thirty minute detention during a routine traffic incident
7408498 for the first time in my adult life i am proud of my country
7408499 as we got to allentown pennsylvania people lined up and cheered
7408500 the common refrain everywhere we went was where do we get these cars
7408501 the federation council is ready to recognize abkhazias and south ossetias independence if the people of these regions wish and if there is an appropriate decision by the russian president
7408502 and im like yeah and hes all no and im like soooooooo not happy and shes all pissed and then hes like

7408508 a boy came with me after ten minutes another person came first he kept checking the electricity meter and then he went inside after 15 20 minutes there was an explosion inside
7408509 the watches wires and explosives recovered from the site point towards a plan of exploding a timer device
7408510 it could well still be staged in pakistan but the board decided today that if there are doubts four five or six months ahead of the due date of october next year then the board would seek to relocate it
7408511 it was considered but dismissed very rapidly quite simply because there was no longer sufficient lead time to relocate the event in the same time frame
7408512 three countries had indicated to me privately ahead of south africas decision that they would not be able to send a squad for reasons of safety and security
7408513 in fact of the eight participating teams five of the teams had indicated that they would not be able to send a team to pakistan in the current circumstances
7408514 it was either relocating to sri lanka or the second option was to keep the right to host the tournament by agreeing to its postponement
7408515 the first option was not acceptable to us as then we would lose our right to host the tournament we would have also lose the money assured to us as the host country so ultimately it was decided that the tournament be rescheduled
7408516 cricket is not going to die here i am sure of that
7408517 we are passing through a difficult phase but it is not going to last forever
7408518 the ecb made it clear to the icc last week that ecb had a duty of care for england players and officials as well as a desire to ensure the interests of the media and spectators were not compromised
7408519 the ecb explained their reservations and security concerns about staging the tournament in the aftermath of the resignation of the pakistan president pervez musharraf last monday

7408523 to ensure we would be in a position to get the settings right and provide continuity during a difficult period
7408524 nothing changed expect to the extent that when we extended mikes contract we believed and we were absolutely right that we were entering a very difficult environment
7408525 we wanted to have the option of security of tenure we also wanted mike to get the setting right for us as we got into the storm
7408526 we believe weve probably passed through the eye of the storm
7408527 weve had that continuity and weve now come to an agreement with mike that he step down
7408528 i cant say that the markets are turning very quickly but were prepared for the environment were in

7408531 wow the wind got strong all of sudden can hardly keep the car on the road
7408532 its not the wind look at the trees theyre barely moving
7408533 miss elaine youre back i missed you are you all better now
7408534 we took a couple shots at it but we couldnt quite get it we got it better by making it a little freer getting into the corner but we couldnt get it where we needed it
7408535 we were on the verge of making it perfect in this sport however even if youre close to perfect youre not going to win you have to be absolutely perfect the car the pit stops the strategy everything
7408536 we were afraid to make dramatic changes to the car because with only 250 laps theres not enough time to recover
7408537 the primary goal every week is to race on the lead lap bring the car home in one piece make the car better during the race and be competitive we accomplished that we made the most of our opportunities
7408538 well do our homework before we come back here next year and well be a lot better we wont need much to be really good the next time but at bristol a little bit goes a long way
7408539 we have back up boxes and stuff but nothing worked so we had to come in and change the whole panel and away she went we just tripped over ourselves were trying to get into the top 10 in points if were going to stay there we have to avoid nights like this
7408540 it was very unusual what happened well go over everything to see what caused the problem and it wont happen again
7408541 we changed out an entire ignition box in about eight or nine minutes the guys jumped right on the problem and we got marcos back on the track as soon as possible
7408542 i tried to look after the car and be nice to people out there
7408543 normally youre on the offense at bristol we had to play defense at the same time we got some laps at bristol which always helps but all in all it was a very disappointing day
7408544 editing the page content file on the svn side doesnt happen very often
7408545 josh didnt get a whole lot of opportunity to perform but the opportunities he did have he wasnt as effective as he would like to be or we would like to be
7408546 we are where we are with our left handed situation i think more importantly we need to have effective high quality outings and protect the guys so we wont run into any more injuries
7408547 it would be senseless for us to try to force the issue to get him back for what would be two or three more starts
7408548 overall i think every start i went out i was getting better
7408549 i was feeling more comfortable feeling more confident from a results standpoint some things didnt bounce my way
7408550 i feel i made some good strides and got better i learned some of the hitters i learned the league and learned what it takes to be successful obviously winning games is the most important thing but for my first year i was pleased the way every time i went i got better and made adjustments
7408551 hopefully there is a sense of pride doing what we do this is the entertainment business i hope that the pride factor in what we want to do in trying to re establish the fan base in kansas city is at the forefront of their minds
7408552 its not something any coach or manager can make an individual player have it is something thats got to come from within a lot of it has to do with character we will see what kind of character level is there for the remainder of the season
7408553 i dont think you do that unless you have guys on the field who want to accomplish something

7408574 i figured if she was going to get stared at so was i
7408575 ive never walked into a doctors office and felt so at home
7408576 im so thankful for everyone whos even picked up the paper to read the story
7408577 in a town where you dont often hear good things everyone pulled together to help
7408578 i learned that life is very precious and you never know whats going to happen from one moment to the next
7408579 i knew i wrote a good proposal and i knew i had a good idea
7408580 to get them interested in science and give them confidence
7408581 going into it i didnt know a lot about forensics
7408582 i had these kids using trigonometry to figure out the point of contact from a blood splatter
7408583 they really seemed to enjoy the class i think it was successful
7408584 if you create something they enjoy theyre going to be there
7408585 its really a big deal for them and it certainly was a special evening for me
7408586 they said they had a good time and really enjoyed the area
7408587 i hate to say this but from what weve been talking about the focus is really on the long term
7408588 the organization and i really dont want to come back and risk anything i want to play more than anything right now and everybody knows it but everyone is telling me to look out for myself and my future it really hurts when you hear something like that but when you sit down and think about it it makes perfect sense
7408589 every three or four games id have to sit out because it his foot was acting up
7408590 there were times after games this season where i couldnt even walk without it hurting right now i really dont know what the point would be in trying to come back because im not even at the level i was at when i was there i dont feel im even close to that level now i have a walking boot on now and i still have problems with my quad
7408591 when i was in college id have a game at three right after school and by six id be home running or have my mom throw golf balls at me
7408592 id have a class the next day at 7 45 and id be up at 5 30 running and hitting
7408593 its about being prepared for the first 72 hours after an emergency situation occurs we want people to consider how theyll notify their families and where theyll meet
7408594 youre more likely to be able to reach someone by cell phone outside the critical area than inside the area
7408595 what if youre visiting another country while stationed overseas and a disaster occurs
7408596 will you have enough foreign currency to get where you need to go will language be a barrier
7408597 we do this so our soldiers downrange can feel comfortable that their families are being well taken care of at home
7408598 it frees them up to focus on what they need to focus on in combat
7408599 a comment was made by someone at the olympics the other day that is so true
7408600 a lot of people have the will to win but few have the will to prepare
7408601 whatever the response it has to be a community effort
7408602 so ready army officials will work closely with department of homeland security officials community leaders and emergency preparedness personnel
7408603 its a culmination of transformation efforts that started in 2004
7408604 we had three class a style uniforms all the same style jacket with just a different color the policies on how we wore accoutrements on them were different we asked the question if we wear one only which would it be and the blue uniform was the most popular of the three
7408605 that is kind of a right of passage as you transition from being a junior enlisted soldier to a noncommissioned officer
7408606 annabelle rama and sharon cuneta air disappointment with gma 7
7408607 i think they are all homosexual communists in satans army i espect as well they all live together and bathe together every morning and have the anal sex with one another with the fisting and the guinea pigs
7408608 i can never quite tell if the defeatists are conservative satirists poking fun at the left or simply retards or both retarded satire perhaps
7408609 you two the rev and el comandante make an erudite pair i guess it beats thinking

7408621 there was a lot of institutional selling in sterling mr waterer said
7408622 on the back of that we saw some other currencies fall such as the euro and the australian dollar
7408623 it was a follow on from the falls in fridays session
7408624 a stronger us dollar weaker gold theme has seen the aussie dollar retrace below the 0 8650 level mr waterer said
7408625 gold fell on the stronger us dollar and commodity currencies like the aussie have fallen on the back of that

7408633 thats an extremely disturbing example of dhs conducting a shoddy investigation where the investigator failed to interview key witnesses and misstated the information of other witnesses
7408634 for dhs to handle the case the way they did is a travesty of justice
7408635 verbal interactions with children that included name calling shaming making derogatory remarks and using language that threatened humiliated or frightened children
7408636 she would yank a child across the room by their arm ive seen her take children out of the classroom and have them come back with red marks on their arms i had a child wet themselves because they were so afraid of her
7408637 i saw mrs gupta on numerous occasions be verbally abusive and terrorize children theyd be crying sometimes shaking it was extremely hard to watch
7408638 i have spent so much time in that school over 11 years but have never seen any of the children mishandled
7408639 of course its common sense its nothing bad to say its to get children to think
7408640 because some people are strict it means they are abusive thats bull
7408641 it is an insurgency and an ideological war it is our country and we will defend it the world is losing the war i think at the moment they the taleban definitely have the upper hand the issue which is not just a bad case scenario as far as pakistan is concerned or as afghanistan is concerned but it is going to be spreading further the whole world is going to be affected by it
7408642 we have nothing against the technology we just dont want that delivery system
7408643 they seem to think our community is their open job site
7408644 if we were going to have our landscape dotted with refrigerator size boxes we should have some control over them
7408645 we asked them to move certain locations and they voluntarily did
7408646 never we got some of those bounces today which is nice because that hasnt happened in a while
7408647 it wasnt the prettiest of lines and the prettiest of things
7408648 but i was able to calm down a little bit make some pitches so it didnt get too out of hand guys were making good plays just to hold them right there was good
7408649 we win the first two games and up three you feel good we got the yips out there for some reason it happens
7408650 thats the first time in a long time feels like months since weve had a four run lead
7408651 it definitely feels like the end of a long losing streak because we won
7408652 i think that once hillary clinton gets up there and has her speech shell put all this to rest
7408653 i think at the end of the day you wont be loyal to hillary if you are not loyal to obama
7408654 i want clinton to be honored and respected and a roll call is a way to honor her
7408655 ja den wunsch gibt es den haben mir die georgier nicht ausgetrieben
7408656 jump through the glass and kill us and its all your fault mom
7408657 if the u s dollar is rising commodities take a hit its been a huge factor
7408658 we may see this rally in the u s dollar continue in the short term but you have to differentiate between speculation and the underlying demand for commodities
7408659 the majority of the increase in commodities over the last five years has been driven by demand from china and the emerging economies being so great that supplies havent been able to keep up
7408660 we store them very very carefully in the hopes that someone someday may decide that we can use them again
7408661 youd have to talk to every one of the 10 072 election jurisdictions across the country
7408662 after 2000 everyone thought you could throw a bunch of money at the problem and make it go away right away elections aint that kind of thing
7408663 you could have full control over your environment by just being able to move your tongue
7408664 this could give you an almost infinite number of switches and options for communication
7408665 its easy and somebody could learn an entirely different language
7408666 left up could be turning lights on right down could be turning off the tv
7408667 there are amazing comic performers around the world and there are fans who want to see them we saw an opportunity to deliver that service
7408668 but we are not saying you have to come to rooftop we will find you where you are
7408669 in the beginning it was about single clip videos but now the mainstream content has come online and there is an expectation for quality
7408670 one of the challenges we all have now is that the web audience has adult attention deficit disorder and moves around quickly a company that draws audience by creating a destination will win the video war
7408671 its all about creating tv like experience the advertisers need to be able to predict frequency which allows brands to build the presence with viewers
7408672 creating a virtual cycle between watching tv and online so they are complementary is the future of the industry
7408673 its very empowering for our fans to know that there are tens of thousands of people watching the show at the same time
7408674 right now we are talking about pc and tv but soon every device will have a potential for video your photo frame will stream videos from grandmas visit or broadcast the weather channel
7408675 pretty soon the idea of tv sitting in the living room will disappear
7408676 hes quite popular and i think people should have the chance to vote for him
7408677 id love to see the mayor stay another term hes done a terrific job and if you extend the mayors term you have to do the council
7408678 one of the envelopes also contained a copy of an august 2005 change order request in the amount of 101 708 82 which was awaiting the employees approval for payment
7408679 it is apparent lees attempted bribe was intended to influence
7408680 his company did the work they get off for free
7408681 the whole thing with mr lee is that his intention was to give the employees a christmas gift in this case he gave them a really big gift they got all their work for free
7408682 i knew that for me to live someone else had to die i prayed to the lord and said if he kept me here i understood that to whom much is given much would be required
7408683 the heart is not innervated so it doesnt automatically beat faster because im doing something that requires more energy
7408684 so distance walking is perfect for me because it gives the heart time to adjust
7408685 she grady lives just over there not too far about 10 or 15 minutes away
7408686 i did it on a dare from one of my fellow transplant buddies frank bodino who also met his wife online
7408687 she once dated one of my friends and i had a crush on one of her friends
7408688 were advised to give it to the medalist as a gift

7408693 todays wi fi handoff protocols are incredibly fragile in outdoor environments and mobile environments
7408694 artificially limited to talking to only one access point or only one base station at a time even though there may be other base stations
7408695 its the radiocarbon date that to our minds is like a square peg in a round hole its not fitting properly and the question is why
7408696 there is a lot of other evidence that suggests to many that the shroud is older than the radiocarbon dates allow and so further research is certainly needed
7408697 the decision is a matter for its owners that is the holy see and the vatican has said nothing must be touched

7408705 the newspaper is of the view that musharraf proved a poor leader he may have been the best bet for assistance in the war on terror at the time the us sought those ties but his forced resignation leaves quite a political mess
7408706 it will have to be seen if the two of them can govern together or whether they were only able to co operate when battling musharraf
7408707 internationally pakistans blind eye towards terrorists could have fatal consequences for the us and its allies
7408708 if sharif and zardari are to succeed where musharraf could not they have to put aside their petty differences they have to gain the support of the army which though demoralised remains the most powerful force in pakistan they have to convince chief of army staff ashfaq kayani that corralling the isi is important not just for americas priority the war on terror but also for the stability of pakistan and they have to trust general kayani a one time head of the isi to do his job
7408709 as musharraf exits pakistan needs a revivified military and strong civilian rule if it is to quell the havoc caused by al qaeda the us needs all of that too
7408710 many of the its bombings and assaults since then in europe north africa and southeast asia have cost almost one tenth as much or even less
7408711 ingredients to build bombs that would have cost 15 dollars apiece to assemble
7408712 i dont think that humans were the main agent because theres evidence of co existence between humans and megafauna over long periods of time which knocks flannerys blitzkrieg theory on the head
7408713 the tasmanian results echo those on mainland australia putting humans squarely back in the frame as the driving force behind the megafaunal extinction
7408714 argument for climate change being the cause of this mass extinction has been seriously undermined
7408715 its sad to know that our ancestors played such a major role in the extinction of these species and sadder still when we consider that this trend continues today
7408716 they have this article of faith now that humans arrived swept across the continent and wiped out the megafauna
7408717 theyve got one species from a cave where theres no evidence of people and suddenly its human causation
7408718 it is only a matter of time before wolves spread all across northern germany in their move ever westward
7408719 aside from two large cities berlin and hamburg the region is sparsely settled there are vast areas of woodlands lakes and dark forests
7408720 weasels and otters and raccoons are already well re establishing themselves
7408721 and the european moose elk is poised to move westward indeed elk are already relatively common in the czech republic
7408722 wolves are certainly welcome here as they enrich the local wildlife assortment
7408723 of course if they become a pest hunters will have to go after them to keep their population number in check as we do with red foxes
7408724 they decimate not only mice but also other small mammals and snakes and other egg thieves
7408725 we actually get appeals from residents to kill more foxes
7408726 because they are eliminating too many predators in some nature wildlife preserves
7408727 this is the region where we shall see whether the wolf spreads further westward and if so in what numbers
7408728 the main problem will be the clich of the big bad wolf in the minds of many people wolves can of course be dangerous to humans in certain situations generally when they are backed into a corner but they are generally no threat to humans
7408729 europeans generally are very mindful of the dire effects that humans have had on the environment over the centuries and they are for the most part happy to see the return of bears and wolves and other creatures after near extinction of those species
7408730 as more predators move in the balance of nature returns to normal and we see a reduction in rats and mice and rabbits
7408731 those small creatures form the diet of predators such as the german sea eagle which was the emblem of germany for centuries but which was driven to the verge of extinction by unthinking hunters
7408732 this is an act which stands in absolute violation of islamic as well as local pakhtun traditions
7408733 im sorry you took my statement that way i can promise you i didnt intend it in the way you perceived it
7408734 gee whiz kristine its too bad you didnt read the whole conversation before you responded because if you had youd know that weve already resolved the issue
7408735 looks like you guys have this all resolved but if you need input specifically from me please let me know
7408736 providing active stimulating and authentic learning experiences that support learner collaboration construction and reflection remains key to successful distance learning technologies
7408737 never before in history has innovation offered promise of so much to so many in so short a time
7408738 you give your e mail address you fill out a page about yourself and then you can have friends in cyberspace so you can have these groups that organize kids theres messaging that goes on these web sites where theyre told to be at a certain place come to this meeting participate in this way
7408739 we are planning to launch a new company which will be named
7408740 the cpl is a globally recognised brand that has more history in the videogame industry than all other leagues combined we look forward to reintroducing gamers to a better larger and more exciting cpl
7408741 this acquisition is just the kind of positive support that the international interactive entertainment industry needs i look forward to seeing cpl continue under new management adding further accolades to its history
7408742 in 1914 this collection was moved to an area south of the present north boundary of brackenridge park and 1914 has been regarded as the year the zoo was established
7408743 the speaker was never in any danger and she appreciates the quick and professional response of the police
7408744 at this stage were looking at maybe getting xena warrior princess lucy lawless and that guy from pathfinder and doom whats his name
7408745 while we encourage mr luhrmann to continue his film making career we have also seen his other films our cultural identity is very close to our hearts in this country we do not want to see a cavalcade of sheep doing the can can sheep are an essential part of our history heritage and home life and should be treated with respect and love
7408746 does it have an elf in it no then we dont give a shit
7408747 the free thought movement has never been stronger in this country
7408748 i dont have a problem with people expressing their points of view in public
7408749 i would prefer that there was serious tolerant dialogue that might emerge from this publicity campaign because it is much needed
7408750 the ffrf fails to acknowledge history which recognized the strong christian commitment of those who attended the constitutional convention
7408751 i think the billboards are going to alert people to the fact that there are organizations that support lack of believe in a supernatural being
7408752 the ffrf fails to acknowledge history which recognized the strong christian commitment of those who attended the constitutional convention
7408753 imagine theres no heaven its easy if you try no hell below us above us only sky imagine all the people living for today
7408754 be careful what you wish for lest it come true
7408755 can you imagine two old ladies in their 70s being re educated through labor
7408756 i feel very sad and angry because were only asking for the basic right of living and its been six years but nobody will do anything to help
7408757 in order to ensure smooth traffic flow a nice environment and good social order we will invite these participants to hold their demonstrations in designated places
7408758 for chinese petitioners if their protest applications were approved it would lead to a chain reaction of others seeking to voice their problems as well
7408759 im glad to hear that over 70 protest issues have been solved through consultation dialogue
7408760 given this moment when the international spotlight is shining on china when so much of the international media are in beijing its unfathomable why the authorities are intensifying social control
7408761 the truth is theyre sending a clear and disturbing message one theyre not even trying to hide which is were not even interested in hearing dissenting voices
7408762 our policy is to encourage the chinese government to respect free expression and freedom of religion which are protected by law
7408763 china is trying to show the world this face that they are a modern progressive country but that really isnt the truth
7408764 the real face is one that denies freedom of expression and that denies it brutally and violently when it can
7408765 disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7408766 because of the olympics we are not allowed to do our jobs anymore the whole place was shut down and we dont know when well be able to go back
7408767 the place is not so big and it wouldnt be able to hold everyone who wants to come we are not qualified
7408768 is in line with beijing s promises to the international olympic committee to adhere to the olympic traditions such as free expression outside the sporting venues
7408769 it must be the most cynical interpretation of the freedom to protest that you follow the rules apply five days in advance then are turned away or put under house arrest or worse
7408770 how desperate do you have to be to file a protest that would result in likely detention
7408771 theyll keep most of the things in place certainly the harassment of the dissidents and we wont see any kind of greater move towards liberalization or opening up or anything like that
7408772 did this change china s view in the world is this a turning point no it will just reinforce your sense of a party thats completely insecure and lacking a great deal of confidence
7408773 i believe the olympics will make china more open more transparent more tolerant and more confident
7408774 the chinese government has become more confident because of a successful olympics that helps the liberal wing of the leaders they will argue that we should not be so scared of the international media and international integration and also to a certain extent openness or transparency
7408775 who would have thought it possible that a tiny little flower could preoccupy a person so completely that there simply wasnt room for any other thought
7408776 it had long since come to da vincis attention that people of accomplishment rarely sit back and let things happen to them they go out and happen to things
7408777 liked how hockfield tied all the themes together with da vinci
7408778 go to most of the programs take this week as an opportunity to meet new people
7408779 you took an average life and turned it in to so much more
7408780 have fun flying the eternal sky will certainly miss that smiling face
7408781 frenchmen czechs jews and communists alike as they were all human beings
7408782 it is a good catholic journal the writing is sound and i even intended to subscribe
7408783 the advantage of open source is that no single entity has authoritative control over a project
7408784 but one argument says open source is less secure and people can put bad things in it and thats true too
7408785 nuns are above all women and beauty is a gift from god
7408786 this contest will be a way to show there isnt just the beauty we see on television but also a more discrete charm
7408787 you really think all nuns are old stunted and sad this isnt the case any more thanks to the arrival in our country of young and vital nuns
7408788 antonious was thirsty so he asked for a drink of water and then for another and the prison guard was probably nervous and said youll get a pain in your belly from the water and he said the last thing im worried about is a pain in my belly im going to be dead in a few minutes
7408789 he had a handkerchief and a 100 000 rupiah note and he asked me to take those out of his pocket and give them to his wife
7408790 then he said father are you still there would you come forward and take off my shoes so i went forward and took off the shoes and he wanted his wife to get the shoes
7408791 after they were shot they were hurting they were moaning and it takes seven minutes to die the blood was coming out so then i tried singing a few hymns when they were dying so you could say its torture shooting people its torture
7408792 its torture its seven minutes to die so the heart is trying to pump the blood to the brain the brain is still alive and as long as theres blood getting to the brain the brain is not going to die
7408793 in extremely poor taste and it should not have been used to promote london
7408794 this is a general three minute video of london in which an artwork by marcus harvey very fleetingly appears
7408795 the video is not for general public use and has been used many times over the last few years to show to the tourism trade
7408796 there has never been a complaint made about the video up until this point
7408797 however if any offence has been caused we will withdraw it from use with immediate effect
7408798 a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show if it gets in the way of the show thats appalling its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic
7408799 were going to try to go dark to the extent that the characters allow it
7408800 hes got some major problems like internal bleeding and hes on dialysis so his kidneys are failing again and they are talking again about suspected pneumonia so they are three bad reports
7408801 everything is down and its not looking good but weve still got hope
7408802 this is one of our biggest conference games were going to have all year so we have to make sure were on key and paying attention all the time
7408803 it happened here in the first two weeks of camp
7408804 its been more intense more hitting with a higher intensity than in past years before we were playing those few games where we could warm up a little bit but this year we have to come out really firing augustana is a really good opponent and we cant come out soft
7408805 i want to thank all the coaches who are here i want to thank thefamilies of the colt family who have helped this organization flourish i want to most of all i want to thank the players i am proud ofyou the country is proud of you the people from indiana have supportedyou and you didnt let them down

7408808 we hebben hier te maken gekregen met zeer wisselende omstandigheden
7408809 we hebben ons niet voor niks vooraf druk gemaakt over het klimaat het is de investering meer dan waard geweest
7408810 als je tien jaar lid bent van het ioc heb je recht op het erelidmaatschap
7408811 maar dan moet je het nog wel worden mijn voordracht door het executive board werd redelijk gemakkelijk ontvangen en bij acclamatie aangenomen daardoor zit ik voor de rest van mijn leven in het ioc
7408812 ik heb hier goed gespeeld maar net in de beslissende pot niet goed genoeg die jongen bracht alles terug en mijn service liep niet zoals het moest
7408813 if hes up to it in the 11th hour and can get the green light from doctors he might be able to pull it off
7408814 my hunch is that is gonna be one of the worst moments in the entire campaign for one of the candidates but its barack obama
7408815 we have to prepare for the world coming to the arctic
7408816 the totality of the research on cocoa flavanols is impressive this is just one more study adding to an increasing body of literature connecting regular cocoa flavanol consumption to blood flow and vascular health improvements throughout the body
7408817 ongoing efforts to create positive and lasting peace in the region and progress towards the shared goal of a peace agreement in 2008
7408818 the challenged statutes give constitutionally adequate notice of the conduct prohibited and sufficiently determine guidelines for law enforcement

7408964 as a nation we now look forward to holding the olympic games in london in 2012
7408965 the golden triumphs of the present british team can only serve as further inspiration to those who will be working hard over the next four years to make the london games a shining example of olympic success
7408966 the handover was marked with a quirky eight minute cameo of the capital that smacked more of the swinging sixties than of the 21st century cosmopolis that will stage the next games

7408975 some people need to go home so one boat is going to return
7408976 others are going to stay here for a month but overall were trying to create an ongoing ferry service that brings in people and supplies from cyprus to gaza this is not a one time attempt
7408977 they are going to take 10 palestinian students with them
7408978 the idea is to get them out of gaza to cyprus and then off to universities elsewhere
7408979 it was political the point was to break the siege and change israeli policy in gaza it wasnt a one time thing we are going to continue bringing boats into gaza and those will have humanitarian assistance on board
7408980 they let these two boats in so i dont see why they wouldnt let a third one in
7408981 were trying to open gaza up to the outside world in an additional gesture of solidarity with the residents of gaza some 25 of the humanitarian volunteers are scheduled to go out to sea with gaza fishermen on monday

7408983 what really got me onboard was this whole surfing aspect of things and how well they pulled the water element of this film off i said theyre going to do a surfing movie how are the waves going to look is it going to look like a photograph type thing then they started to show me some of the footage that they had worked on and being a surfer myself it was a thrill to be a part of bringing to the audience what that feels like to be locked in a tube thats kind of what got me onboard
7408984 i had done animated films in the past and that was kind of a lonely experience where you sit in the booth where youve got your sides and youre reading this stuff and imagining what this other person is saying or doing the scene to their playback without them in the room but in this instance the characters were often all there in the same room i did a lot of work with shia lebeouf who is a wonderful improviser we were really encouraged to do that by the directors as much as we cared to and we did a lot of it there were also cameras set up in the room that were capturing our movements and our expressions and that was all going to help the animators so it was a lot of fun it didnt feel as lonesome as it has in the past and as clinical it was really a fun experience and very loose

7408992 if i did not have firm belief in truthfulness compassion and forbearance solid conviction in the goodness of life determination to live and the thought that i must not die perhaps i would have died long ago countless times and left the human world forever
7408993 it was as if the sky had suddenly fallen and everything around me had changed my work was suspended and i was asked to write self criticisms and hand in my falun gong books i could not understand i was the same person only having gained the understanding of lifes significance and meaning and was trying to be better than a good person i was receiving praise a day before but the next day i was made never to raise my head again
7408994 the cell was about three square meters the wall was high but there was no ventilation the window was blocked and the cracks around the door were thickly covered so there was no light even during the day
7408995 a loudspeaker pierced my ears this was the beginning of a most painful two years of my life in labor camps
7408996 you must preserve your life you must preserve your life
7408997 they knew i had a one year old child so they tormented me with this it was extremely painful to hear the childs crying
7408998 when they removed the window cover and i could see light i saw maggots crawling on the floor and around the toilet
7408999 they tied up my hands and feet lifted my feet and tied them to a chair and used a rope from strips of bed sheets to tie my neck to the back of the chair so tight that i could not move they put a cover over my head and made it tight with a rope
7409000 if she dies well say she died from a heart attack we have quotas for this dont be afraid it doesnt matter she will not die easily if she is only suffocated for a few minutes she will not die we surely want her to have a taste of wanting to die but cant and wanting to live but cant
7409001 the pain i experienced was beyond description one would rather die than experience such pain in the intentionally prolonged suffocation before death time was extended endlessly and space was totally isolated at such moments the pain itself was not dreadful what was dreadful was that you were not able to see the end of the pain that was a dreadful experience of a life without hope the dreadful despair could destroy ones will to live at such moments death was no longer a fearful experience but a release
7409002 falun dafa is good falun dafa is wronged zhang lianying is wronged
7409003 hes sort of like us he comes from a middle class background went to school on scholarships he and his wife had to figure out child care and how to start a college fund for their kids
7409004 a better sense of who he is and where hed like to lead the country
7409005 the only way we will be successful is if we are unified as a party and all democrats know we are full partners
7409006 i have a responsibility i do not own my vote i have to represent the voters who sent me
7409007 they would give you all the blurb all the copy then you would have to illustrate it panel to panel and you had a certain amount of poetic license
7409008 i had this drive to try to do the best i could one time i picked up a script one editor said one thing about you sitton i know youre going to fill the page that was a compliment
7409009 the style the artwork was a lot more clean and crisp
7409010 even without reading a lot of words it told a story in and of itself
7409011 he was very surprised i was able to find all that stuff
7409012 i think what they did was important this is part of americana
7409013 so many things happened to me in terms of racism from teachers principals and other students
7409014 i decided im not going to subject my kids to that
7409015 ten years ago there were not that many people of color home schooling
7409016 almost everybody knows in public schools blacks are at the bottom of the totem pole
7409017 i said no way am i going to allow you to do this type of damage to my child
7409018 i yanked him out and didnt know what i was going to do
7409019 theyve gotten a chance to see real life and make application with learning and weve been able to forge our belief system
7409020 we havent missed it you learn to tighten your belt
7409021 we were appalled and very disappointed in ourselves for putting him that environment
7409022 the teacher was sweet as she can be but there were a handful of kids totally disrupting the class we couldnt see how anybody could learn in that environment
7409023 my kids i want them to be well rounded and we have that choice when we choose their curriculum
7409024 there was this trend where the amount of homework was equated with how rigorous your program was
7409025 what youre seeing in spring branch and in other places is a backlash to that
7409026 im not a believer in sending home 25 algebra questions as homework when five would let the teacher know if the student gets it
7409027 homework to be useful has to be graded and has to have prompt feedback it cant be done for completion only
7409028 it would be really nice to have some family time in the evenings to unwind to talk about your day
7409029 that doesnt mean that young children shouldnt be doing some homework
7409030 but the assignments should be short lead to success involve parents and demonstrate to kids that the things they are learning in school have applications to things they enjoy doing at home
7409031 anything that goes home for homework cannot be new material
7409032 it has to be something they have done before in class theres just not enough time in the day with all of the things we have to do to practice
7409033 students certainly are going to be expected to get things done on their own so thats an important skill
7409034 its kinda hard but thats my job to do it
7409035 asking children to work more doesnt have to be a boring horrible way to pass time
7409036 its possible to find ways for learning to be interesting and fun so the kids actually look forward to doing work
7409037 when im in council session i tell everyone to watch
7409038 i may need to pick up the phone and say did you get that
7409039 we got the flat screens that dont take up as much room
7409040 i think those big old tvs are a safety hazard
7409041 i just wanted to spend my personal money for that not taxpayer money
7409042 sometimes i have to close the door because of the tv noise
7409043 it leaves the wrong impression that you dont have anything better to do than watch tv
7409044 i cannot see paying taxpayer dollars without getting them something in return thats why i like to give most of my surplus money to parks
7409045 being a newly elected official i wanted to make sure we knew each others personalities and how to deal effectively with the public
7409046 as an at large council person its really a challenge to get to all parts of the city
7409047 you can show up at a meeting and people might not know you
7409048 we needed some more storage space so we got some units that had shelving and storage built in
7409049 its very functional its not anything thats extra or over the top
7409050 i could have bought all new furniture but i didnt
7409051 i just took the chairs and had them re upholstered
7409052 i got to be here for six years i wanted it to match if you didnt notice i like to match
7409053 as i acquired them i grew to appreciate vans work more and more
7409054 one of the things most courtrooms need is a splash of color and a sense of proportion most courtrooms are pretty drab
7409055 we should not be intimidated by the courthouse but neither should we enter it as casually as we would enter a store or restaurant
7409056 in a windowless courtroom good art adds a necessary degree of spice
7409057 my father spent a lot of time in courtrooms and now my art hangs in one
7409058 we are the custodian for the public and we need to offer an environment where people feel comfortable
7409059 i think its wonderful more inviting to lawyers and to parties
7409060 it feels better than looking at pictures of old judges or maps of texas
7409061 the courthouse is the face of government and for many people it is where theyll have their most important interaction with government
7409062 i meant this to be something that doesnt look government issue
7409063 i had a chance to talk to harry last night saturday and i talked to his mom
7409064 it was a very difficult situation because i told harry id been in this situation before
7409065 he said the one thing he wanted to do was make sure the guys know that this season is real important to him and that we go out and handle our business and he didnt want me to feel bad about what happened
7409066 he told me not to worry about the situation its football
7409067 hell be around but he wont be able to play some people are saying he might not ever play again but the big thing is that hell be happy hell be able to walk
7409068 i grabbed my dog and went into the hallway and yelled help
7409069 she recalled within minutes her plea was answered by her neighbor tc lenormand who carried her down the stairs to the lobby
7409070 i was so afraid he was going to hurt himself
7409071 its important to raise peoples awareness they need to think about what they would do to evacuate way ahead of time they should practice with friends and family
7409072 find themselves in a situation where they have to roll themselves down the steps
7409073 i always evaluate the facility and determine how im going to get out of my room
7409074 there was a fire alarm and i was evacuating and i found a woman yelling for help
7409075 i carried her down thats the long and short of it
7409076 you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bill
7409077 are you from australia where the women are always pregnant and men are habitual thieves do you not hear thunder
7409078 im from australia where people drink a lot of beer and male inhabitants vomit presumably as a result of plentiful beer
7409079 do you not hear thunder youd better run better take cover
7409080 are you trying to tempt me because i come from a nation that seems rich and plentiful in comparison to yours
7409081 oh do you come from australia where the woman are always pregnant and the men are habitual thieves do you not hear thunder youd better run better take cover
7409082 i dont think that word means what you think it means

7409130 i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us
7409131 he comes from a middle class background he went to school on scholarships he had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about child care we had to figure out you know how to start a college fund for their kids
7409132 has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7409133 we went to war and millions of people have died based on falsities
7409134 democrats voted for fisa democrats keep voting to fund the war and we want the leaders of the democratic party to take a stand for peace and justice not just here but all around the world
7409135 democrats gathering here are more optimistic about their partys chances in the general election than they have been from some time
7409136 still theres an undertow of worry about just how unified the party is in the wake of a bruising primary fight how enthusiastically clinton and more importantly her supporters embrace the soon to be nominee will be perhaps the most closely watched dynamic in denver
7409137 bright moon clear moon bright and fair lift up your right foot therell be a hair
7409138 underage drinking is a serious threat to the health and safety of our young people
7409139 the think dont drink initiative will give these young people the information they need to avoid underage drinking and make responsible and healthy decisions
7409140 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7409141 the way to deal with it is not to announce it its to do it the last thing you want to do is telegraph to the folks in pakistan that were about to violate their sovereignty
7409142 would i make a blanket commitment to meet unconditionally with the leaders of each of those countries within the first year i was president absolutely positively no
7409143 my impression is he thinks that if we leave somehow the iraqis are going to have an epiphany ive seen zero evidence of that
7409144 if the democrats think were going to be able to nominate someone who can win without that person being able to table unimpeachable credentials on national security and foreign policy i think were making a tragic mistake
7409145 i dont recall hearing a word from barack about a plan or a tactic
7409146 id feel a lot better if i knew that president bush was going to be elected and im not being solicitous if i knew he was going to start to listen to john mccain instead of the secretary of defense
7409147 and so ive believed for a long time a view shared by my republican colleague john mccain and many others as well that we need more force in iraq thats not a popular position to take but we need more force now in order to have less force later we need to gain control of security in iraq
7409148 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who
7409149 you cannot go into a 7 11 or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent oh im not joking
7409150 better than everybody else you dont know my state my state was a slave state my state is a border state my state is the eighth largest black population in the country my state is anything from a northeast liberal state
7409151 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7409152 emphasized the role his group plays not only in supporting specific collaborative research projects but also in improving the process of research and its role in the innovation ecosystem including developing and supporting efforts in open access open tools open technology and interoperability

7409158 this platform helps capture and leverage semantic relationships among academic objects such as papers lectures presentations and video to greatly facilitate access to these items in exciting new ways

7409161 i never left scranton as you know scranton never leaves you scranton is part of your heart it becomes part of who you are
7409162 no one on the democratic side knows more about foreign policy than sen biden hes been an articulate spokesman on the subject he also knows about domestic policy hes been a leader on crime control
7409163 the senator is a real son of scranton born and raised here and i think they will both do very very well
7409164 biden has the stature and knowledge and the blue collar no bull pugnacity to call mccain on his imprudent militarism
7409165 in all seriousness biden is a formidable choice not only does he have a depth of knowledge about the law social issues and international relations after decades of senate leadership in all those areas he is a truly nice guy with a real common touch
7409166 the candidate many republicans least wanted to see obama pick was biden
7409167 in his first truly presidential decision barack obama acted like a president and chose a presidential caliber candidate for vice president i recently wrote that this choice would speak volumes about the kind of president he would be that if he choose one of the heavyweight contenders such as sam nunn or joe biden over the less qualified candidates it would be an enormously positive sign obama came through big time
7409168 the senator brings some real strengths to this ticket hes one of the most respected foreign policy minds in the senate something that was reaffirmed by his quick trip to the nation of georgia during the recent crisis there
7409169 i gather that what impressed obama about biden is that biden gets things done hes a man of action
7409170 chinese authorities informed us last night that the eight individuals detained august 20 and 21 respectively were deported by chinese authorities
7409171 we urge china to take positive steps to address international and domestic concerns about its record on human rights and religious freedoms
7409172 after two days of negative publicity over its extrajudicial detention of 10 tibet supporters the chinese government is seeking to suppress a story that would have cast a shadow over the closing ceremony of these olympic games
7409173 our top priority is restoration of the judges and we want it done on monday
7409174 the alliance is intact today but its future depends on the fulfilment of the promise zardari made for the restoration of the judges
7409175 our reception of the prisoners tomorrow will be like a national wedding
7409176 releasing these kinds of prisoners indicates that the criteria israel used in the past will not endure this clears the way for other prisoners
7409177 make the decision which unambiguously supports the will of these two caucasus peoples
7409178 the accident happened on a hill near this village when the tg jes flight crashed for unknown reasons according to preliminary information at least 14 people were aboard
7409179 the airplane did not explode on landing but later spilled fuel on the ground caught fire otherwise nobody would have survived
7409180 itd be better if they had a skate park id love that
7409181 a skate park would be good because you wouldnt be in the street getting your skateboard run over
7409182 youll have to tear out grass and trees to put a skate park there it no longer becomes a park with green but a hardscape where people cant sit on the grass with a blanket
7409183 we want to have visibility from the street for safety
7409184 if we put it in the middle well have issues with kids congregating
7409185 its just one more thing to consider in this very difficult process but eventually well get it right hopefully
7409186 the current plan would be to get something done at johnson maybe begin construction by the end of the year
7409187 the funding is there the will is there its just finding a location that we can meet as many needs as possible
7409188 we thought wed bring a little bit of vegas and hollywood to the south bay
7409189 we wanted to do something high end for people who were above 30
7409190 a lot of the neighbors that live there and live behind there gave me positive feedback
7409191 had disputes in the past with neighbors with the music the doors would open and youd hear a lot of music in the rear
7409192 we have a hook on the ceiling where cabaret girls can swing from and they swing from bars over the drum set on stage
7409193 realized there wasnt anything the bar is attempting to be more glamorous and to draw thirtysomethings a goal owner mike quagletti says is already being met although the establishment has been open only since july 4 bruce hazelton staff phtographer for people in their 30 s and 40 s to go for dinner and dance thats four years ago before the shade
7409194 and who did i see on the southwest flight all three interior designers
7409195 i went on a quest for six months once a month taking pictures of the best clubs in vegas
7409196 it would be nice to just have the measuring device on the spice containers
7409197 i think virginia brown did the right thing by writing how she felt it lets other people know that they can be honest with their feelings and that they dont have to write nice lies because someone is no longer with us it could help some people see that maybe they need to get their act together now maybe the family like the woman said can move past this and come together
7409198 i too was raised by one of the most unkind human beings to ever walk the earth she like dolores aguilar had a wonderful husband who did not outlive her while most reading that obituary would wonder why a person would write such a thing i can answer that it was the only thing the daughter could do
7409199 i dislike the dishonesty and twisting of the truth that sometimes takes place after someone dies i refer to this as instant sainthood the obituary that ms brown wrote for her mother was inspiring and refreshingly honest i dont advocate that every death notice take the approach that she did but im glad theres an option for families who have someone like dolores aguilar in their lives in my opinion its not an obituary that tarnishes the wasted persons life but rather the day to day life she lived speaking the truth about her may help her descendants begin to heal and undo her legacy of cruelty
7409200 the brown obituary was by far the most classless and tasteless one ever im quite sure ms brown doesnt feel compelled to tell the truth in all ways nor should she bashing other people especially ones mother does not set you free i feel sorry for ms brown because she is hurt and wounded and death does not erase that kind of pain perhaps the obit was therapeutic for her and a good starting point to finally work through her anger and sadness
7409201 it takes some guts or a desperate need to purge and get the last word in to write something like that but damn if she wasnt being honest you make a good point though apparently we are becoming more and more accustomed more comfortable letting someone else take care of the simple things in our lives to the point where even a simple handwritten note that explains the life of someone is not a priority but a bill that needs to be paid on time hopefully others will think twice before they open a menu and choose the best obit for the best price
7409202 when i first read this column i laughed i thought it was a joke then i realized what a sad sad story it really is its too bad someone didnt get help for this woman who beat her children which would mean getting much needed help for the children it says the father was a good man did he do anything to stop the childrens abuse i dont mean to blame anyone else for this tragic life but cant help wonder if the childrens pain could have been lessened to think that it started out making me laugh
7409203 billy joel said it succinctly years ago honesty is such a lonely word everyone is so untrue to say the truth about a recently deceased relative who left a trail of abuse neglect and permanent scars on friends and family violates a basic taboo speaking ill of the dead but what about the surviving victims of the dead persons offenses do they not deserve a chance to expiate their devils by telling it like it was and is it hurts to face the wounds but it also heals thank you virginia brown
7409204 the story on dolores aguilar made me sad my mother could almost be her sister my mother was verbally and physically abusive she seldom had or has a nice thing to say to us or others it is sad because my mother is now 87 sick and frail i wonder how we will handle her obituary i dont think i could be as honest as mrs aguilars daughter but i truly admire her honesty
7409205 virginia brown had every right to say what she feels only her and her siblings know what they encountered as children because of their mother and only they know what they still continue to endure on a daily basis because of her its sad but true not all mothers and fathers have done great memorable things for their families the obituary was written with all honesty and will give virginia a sense of relief i hope that she and her siblings are able to come together now and be a family and are able to help each other with the pain that they have dealt with for so many years
7409206 i feel for the surviving family although im of the opinion that it should not have been written at all i too have a mother for whom none of the hallmark cards written ever fit when my mother dies if i write an obit at all it will probably be a bare bones timeline and there will be no funeral or memorial i used to say that my mother looked at the world through me colored lenses i too wish id had a nicer more loving mother but i didnt get one i feel for virginia brown and her siblings and hope they can manage to not pass on the legacy of ugly behavior that was modeled for them
7409207 brava virginia brown thats all i can say about the obituary she wrote regarding her mother obviously an evil woman beloved by none
7409208 i had to find sad humor in this obituary because i also had a mentally ill mother and it was a blessing and relief when she died as it stated i miss what i didnt have and am glad she is no longer tormented with the demons that ran her life and impacted mine i think it was well written honest and to the point
7409209 i hardly know where to start i had one of those mothers when she died i didnt have the courage to do something like that to this day i regret not getting it off my chest so my hats off to ms brown
7409210 there are more people with yet to be diagnosed or invented mental illnesses than doctors willing to perform worthless operations while it seems that undiagnosed mental illness continues to claim more aguilar family members i cant help but wonder why more families dont celebrate the passing of such oppressed individuals with a good public bashing i suppose most people have huge egos and want all their friends to read how wonderful their parents were or perhaps they have done nothing but blame others for their personal failures and simply take advantage of their parents silence
7409211 at least someone out there has the guts to be honest im not one to sugarcoat things at all a couple of years ago a co worker died there were many teary eyes until i asked if anyone knew where he lived did he have a family what was his favorite food and what was his last name for crying out loud nobody could answer but i was told that i was being insensitive i just wish there was more honesty
7409212 this organization is a terrorist organization and created mayhem against the public life so we decided to declare it banned

7409237 that was a beautiful swing he put on the ball
7409238 lou just gave me his point of view on what he thought i should change and i was able to work on that a little in the cage
7409239 in the game i wasnt able to fully introduce what he told me but the result was good
7409240 we shortened his stride a simple little thing to get his hands set a little quicker the swing is shorter more compact and into the ball
7409241 hes a good hitter but he got himself into some bad habits we should have addressed it sooner well just let it go and see if he could work himself out of it
7409242 it was rewarding in the sense that the other players on the team were more excited than i was
7409243 i really appreciate all the support and because of that it makes me want to succeed even more
7409244 you feel terrible you know when youre going bad you come up in key situations to not be able to get the job done or at least put the ball in play to help the team out is frustrating
7409245 theres not a guy in here who wavers on anyone on this team everybodys contributed to our success this year i hope he gets as hot as a pistol
7409246 he was happy too and i was happy for the young man
7409247 compared with yesterday with the heat and humidity i was talking to pitcher ryan dempster about that
7409248 he said that was worse than pitching in florida during the day it was perfect conditions the wind kind of blowing in a little bit too it was a good day to pitch
7409249 i was trying to put good wood on the ball
7409250 i was trying to hit a line drive i always go up there trying to hit line drives hard in the gap i kind of got it good
7409251 actually thats all ive got i hit it the best i could right there
7409252 i think the biggest thing today obviously rich harden but fukudome
7409253 he did a lot of working this morning its nice to see
7409254 i really appreciate all their support and because of that it makes me want to succeed even more
7409255 ive definitely got to give a lot of credit to soto
7409256 weve been working pretty well together i feel really comfortable with him behind the plate really it comes down to mixing up pitches and keeping hitters off balance keeping them guessing hes done a great job with that
7409257 with him it seems like were on the same page after the first or second hitter
7409258 it seems like we fall into a good rhythm he had really good stuff today it was down the fastball seemed like it was overpowering
7409259 its just a precautionary thing i just had some spasms yesterday thats all it is
7409260 its just kind of my left side of my neck down to my back
7409261 i guess its something that doesnt ever go away but its not something that affects you daily
7409262 theres a lot of stuff thats going on around here with us as a team and me as an individual that the future could hold
7409263 i just worry about today i think if i just do that ill have a lot more fun this year
7409264 i dont worry about the contract its exciting but at the same time im more worried about whats going on with us and hopefully winning a division here and hopefully taking it to another level
7409265 right now just try to keep winning games and keep doing what were doing
7409266 i dont know what to say about it im guessing right im getting my pitch and not missing it to be honest with you im not trying to do too much i cant explain it actually

7409292 prostitution related offences have always been very low priority that calls into question why we do this in the first place if theyre such low priority
7409293 unless the police are receiving complaints from the community theyre not going to act
7409294 there are too many deaths too many robberies too many rapes too many beatings which are a direct result of the law

7409330 part of crime free housing is you get these landlords to do criminal and financial background checks on tenants dont rent to people that basically are not going to fulfill their end
7409331 thorncreek has no section 8 or voucher housing in it
7409332 theres a misconception those are people who rent sign leases
7409333 those were bought by a different company they displaced about 50 of the tenants in a two year period
7409334 literally our calls in just that area dropped the people that live there deserve good neighbors
7409335 if you own property in park forest you better have a valid crime free housing license in order to get that you have to put in your lease that if you are a criminal or your guests are criminals the lease is broken

7409339 we encourage the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights including freedom of expression and freedom of religion of all people during the olympic games and beyond

7409384 despite the anti christian prejudice evident in much of the feminist movement it is to the teachings and example of jesus christ that women owe most of their freedoms
7409385 christianity greatly elevated the worlds sexual morality by opposing adultery fornication homosexuality child molestation bestiality and other sexual decadence christianity made a contribution to civilization that was unprecedented it was the result of the tireless work of christians that by the 5th century the wife was able to divorce an adulterous husband something which had never before occurred in the ancient world
7409386 husbands love your wives and do not be bitter toward them
7409387 so husbands ought to love their own wives as their own bodies he who loves his wife loves himself for no one ever hated his own flesh but nourishes and cherishes it just as the lord does the church
7409388 husbands love your wives just as christ also loved the church and gave himself for her
7409389 as a loving deer and a graceful doe let her breasts satisfy you at all times and always be enraptured with her love for why should you my son be enraptured by an immoral woman and be embraced in the arms of a seductress
7409390 and this is the second thing you do you cover the altar of the lord with tears with weeping and crying so he does not regard the offering anymore nor receive it with goodwill from your hands
7409391 therefore take heed to your spirit and let none deal treacherously with the wife of his youth
7409392 i think i speak for millions of people in the uk when i say we have been dazzled we have impressed we have been blown away by these beijing games but we have not been intimidated and in our own sweet way without wasting taxpayers money i am absolutely convinced that we can do just as well in 2012
7409393 as we expected the chinese party did not pay on the due date we then hired a local lawyer to file suit in the hometown of the chinese defendant and as we usually do in commercial litigation we had the local lawyer seize assets from the defendant in a prejudgment writ of attachment this required our client post a money bond which we had arranged in advance using our contacts in the local bonding community within three weeks of our filing suit the chinese defendant paid all amounts owing together with interest court costs and attorneys fees
7409394 in the situations i have witnessed there is no divine intervention all we have is each other we create our own problems and it us up to us to solve them

7409434 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media
7409435 the more negativland started appropriating media the more we thought about it means
7409436 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
7409437 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
7409438 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
7409439 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

7409450 then the epa ruled that i couldnt build the ark until theyd conducted an environmental impact study on your proposed flood
7409451 im still trying to resolve a complaint with the civil rights
7409452 also the trades unions say i cant use my sons they

7409477 there are elements within the church who say that if you are at odds with any of the teachings of the church you are at odds with the church i think the church is bigger than that
7409478 if i were an ordained priest id be taking some issue with some of the more narrow interpretations of the gospel being taken now

7409485 i just have to tell you the popes wrong on this im going with the president
7409486 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition and st augustine said three months we dont know the point is it that it shouldnt have an impact on a womans right to chose

7409491 karena itu jangan sampai alergi terhadap politik hadirnya puluhan partai politik parpol diharapkan menjadi wadah bagi para politisi yang jujur dan ikhlas mengabdi kepada rakyat

7409508 competition is the key to progress provided that self glorification and self aggrandizement is perceived to be the hoped for final product both selfish gain and selfish path complement and reinforce each other to replace competition with collaboration we will have to socialise the masses mindset to view collective glorification and collective aggrandizement as the hoped for final product only then will collaboration be perceived as the method by which progress is best pursued

7409510 er zijn geen objectieve criteria voor stijl inhoud of vorm die bepalen wat literatuur is
7409511 iets is literatuur als de culturele gemeenschap dat vindt in eerste plaats de literaire critici en uitgevers
7409512 ik kijk naar schoonheid zowel qua stijl als compositie welke verbanden er worden gelegd ik vraag me af wat interessant is aan een boek leer ik er iets van heeft het mijn inzicht in de wereld veranderd ik wil in elk geval die ambitie zien
7409513 je zou ook kunnen zeggen literatuur is fictie die na honderd jaar nog wordt gelezen die de tijdgeest overleeft mulisch is bijvoorbeeld geen bijzonder stilist hij is een vaardig schrijver maar ik denk dat een reve over een eeuw nog steeds wordt gelezen en dat mulisch dan toch wat meer is weggezakt
7409514 of werken van vondel of james joyce daar is iedereen het wereldwijd over eens d t is literatuur
7409515 of flauwekul geklets de term lectuur wordt wel gebruikt maar dat is eigenlijk iets wat je leest

7409523 it was a good night for the offense and the defense as well
7409524 i think as a team we showcased what we can do throughout the whole season
7409525 hes been held back a little bit by that toe
7409526 weve been very cautious with him we got him in there a little bit last week and thought he made some strides and we really saw it this week in practice and his confidence starting to grow
7409527 any time an athlete is coming off an injury theres a growth and confidence factor no matter who you are it takes a little time
7409528 i wasnt worried too much about it its getting better slowly im expecting to deal with some kind of discomfort throughout the season but once the doctors told me youre not going to do anything to hurt it i was all ahead from that point
7409529 the line we have theyre young theyre good weve got a good line and having hoover back there brings wisdom to the whole running game it just makes me comfortable back there to have him back there
7409530 it was a good experience my experience was definitely different than last week last week was more of getting my feet wet i had a little bit more confidence tonight and especially when one of your first runs is a big run it builds confidence
7409531 he was healthy enough to do it tonight so well just kind of wait and see
7409532 when youre thinking youre not as explosive as you want to be i just came ready to play tonight and now when im out there its all instinct
7409533 its the type of hit that occurs once or twice a year around the world
7409534 i have guys i have to take care of right now
7409535 we have to take care of the gfeller family and their wishes too but we have a football team i have to take care of and seven other coaches and we have to get ourselves back together and be able to get through this
7409536 there are 33 boys there and for every one of them there has been a different way to handle it like anything in grief there is a process but each one of them is handling it in their own way and we will have to just help them through that
7409537 but you fall off the horse and you have to get back on it and thats what we will try to do and at the same time we will honor the gfeller familys wishes and keep the memory of matt alive in our minds and hearts
7409538 i think nick and i have agreed were going to wait another week to name the starter
7409539 weve got some time to figure it out and when we name the starter that guy will get more reps in practice i feel confident with either one of them because we like some of things jarrett can do and some of the things tienne can do
7409540 i think hell be ready to go in two weeks
7409541 its real minor with him right now because if it was serious i think hed already have a cast on it i think hell be ready to go by a amp t
7409542 i kind of rolled it after stepping into one of those holes but ill be ready for a amp t
7409543 the intensity was very good and i thought the guys got after it pretty well
7409544 we have had some good recruits come in and that should help us
7409545 i still feel like im a young guy and i guess they look up to me a little bit
7409546 ill still try to be a leader and tell them whats going on and keep them on the right track
7409547 its nice to see and i think with the facilities over here and what we are trying to do i think people understand where we are going with this program
7409548 so its nice to see so many people here for this
7409549 i probably wouldnt have gotten the job if it had happened any later
7409550 the environment is of equal importance to the main characters in all of cormacs writing
7409551 settings like these test the truth of humanity where you see how good and how bad people can really be
7409552 when i first saw the script it was actually called
7409553 says weisz a london to east village transplant from whom weve come to expect sober cinema
7409554 i got offered a lot of dark dramas after the constant gardener but this was the character id been looking for for a long time
7409555 the key was bringing her genuinely to life so she wasnt just wacky
7409556 and from her films i knew she could bring that depth to the role which was more important here because it was so goofy
7409557 i had two weeks to learn to play piano violin accordion and break dance to juggle do karate play ping pong banjo unicycle and even skateboard
7409558 adrien is really into hip hop i had to rap a classic by slick rick and he was so ashamed the look on his face it was like i was dissing his whole culture
7409559 it was like i joined a gypsy circus a real trip
7409560 the p1 is a little better at receiving signals and the n73 a little better at transmitting signals but the difference is small
7409561 they can see its not a huge problem some have even gone out on activities on tours or sand biking
7409562 i want to be a professional golfer but i want to be a student at college as well
7409563 i wasnt really surprised i knew he was going to come back sometime on some holes
7409564 i was expecting that to happen and since he made that chip in i was thinking ive got to play well and keep focused on my game try to make birdies
7409565 on a scale of one to 10 it was an eight it touched down and went back up and then touched down again tearing everything up and kicking up dust
7409566 she said you won you won you won nothing else to say there just listening to each other smile on the phone
7409567 the best thing they could do was play great volleyball they cant control what had happened and probably are going to try to comprehend the magnitude of that event later but what we can do is try to play the best we can
7409568 i thought that was a real good way for them to deal with it im very proud of their approach and their maturity
7409569 it dawned on me that wed just won the thing and i grabbed my staff theyve been so instrumental in our success obviously for the first three matches of this tournament they were without me and they did a wonderful job
7409570 then after i shook the coaches hands it was just a little too much
7409571 its hard to analyze the match right now the u s played very well theyve grown a lot in the last few years
7409572 we did our best but the best was not enough
7409573 she gets it she was certainly one of the major proponents of me coming back and finishing what we started all those years ago
7409574 the guy that wrote it talked about making the big time where you are
7409575 he talked about people thinking that the big time is the destination but he said the big time is the journey
7409576 i think what weve been on the last few years at appalachian state is an incredible big time journey
7409577 i really think it all starts right at the top
7409578 the chancellor the athletic director theyre the key then right down through the coaches and getting good players
7409579 one of my favorite phrases is i know how not to do it tell me how we can do it i think thats the can do attitude that he has that makes a difference and certainly what jerry has done and the wisdom and energy and experience he has is a wonderful thing to watch plus we have really good kids and success has bred success
7409580 its a credit to these coaches there are about four of them that have had the opportunity to leave over the last two years one of them would have just about doubled his salary but theyve stayed here and its expensive to live in boone every one of those guys wherever they could have gone they would have been better off economically
7409581 i dont think we would have done what we have if we had stayed with the i formation
7409582 i think what were doing on offense is pretty darn good and it fits the kids we recruit
7409583 we dont recruit a kid that everybody on our staff doesnt ok
7409584 i may see a guy and ill say we really need this guy but there may two other coaches that tell me theyve got a better guy
7409585 youve got 63 scholarships but weve got about 100 players when youve got 100 players every once in a while one of them will stump their toe do something theyre regretful of but we havent had a whole lot of that
7409586 there is increasing interest from kids wanting to play here
7409587 and weve been pretty good at getting kids that can run and that are good kids and i think our coaches coach good once we get them here these coaches really try to get the best out of every player we bring in
7409588 you have to have talented players you cant coach that but youve got to have kids that have a desire and work ethic to get even better
7409589 if you havent been to boone in a while its amazing whats going on with the stadium
7409590 weve had great cooperation from the university in terms of things like parking and the town has embraced us people are coming they want to be part of it
7409591 the yosef club this past year raised 2 3 million
7409592 three years ago we raised a half million our goal this year is to hit 2 million in ticket sales three years ago we sold 400 000 weve had a 280 percent increase in season ticket sales the demand is tremendous
7409593 the beauty of it all is that now people nationwide know how to pronounce appalachian
7409594 its fun hearing the stories like someone going to a cubs game in chicago and seeing somebody else wearing an appalachian shirt
7409595 that michigan victory was the beacon moment for appalachian expectations for our football program and with our athletics in general has changed the culture has changed and so has the expectations for our university its exciting to think what will happen 10 years down the road
7409596 were going to finish the facility projects we want to give all our coaches a chance from a scholarship standpoint to be very competitive we want to put together an overall championship program that mirrors the football program
7409597 in this day and age were all having conversations about 4 gas prices and how that affects travel for your teams
7409598 were still in this growth cycle of trying to find what appalachian needs to be successful in the southern conference or whatever conference
7409599 i think weve got some leeway to see where this current streak will take us we still have some work to do for now we want to continue to grow and continue the journey
7409600 hit some big home runs and the walks made the difference
7409601 it was a mental mistake jack does a great job of putting us up and the biggest thing is the first out and i walk johjima and bryan lahair one hit and its all of a sudden a totally different ballgame
7409602 every time we got some runs i would go back out and give it back
7409603 as a starting pitcher thats a terrible feeling to have
7409604 im trying to keep it simple shortening it cutting down on some strikeouts putting the ball in play
7409605 a team from ewa beach hawaii started the u s winning streak in 2005 with little leaguers from georgia taking the prize the previous two years
7409606 i have a camera set up and i have people in there
7409607 okay well let you through this last time but you cant come out any more for water or to use the bathroom if you do we cant let you back in
7409608 i dont want any trouble but youre telling me that if i need water or my wife needs water that we cant come out and get it without fear that we wont be allowed in
7409609 but i have a media credential for the press viewing area
7409610 and theres a sign right there that says this is the press viewing area
7409611 im sorry sir but i wont be able to let you in any more
7409612 if anyone i know gets sick from the heat because they cant leave this is on your head
7409613 hes a right tackle and thats his position and hes anchored it the last four years
7409614 i especially like that we have two freshmen who have come in and are doing really well
7409615 its gone by real fast and it seems like i just got here
7409616 ive just tried to improve my game to possibly go to the next level i want to stay in tip top shape this season to see what happens for my future
7409617 he cant kick that high but i might ease up on what i say to him now knowing that he knows that tae bo stuff
7409618 i didnt know that but ill have to give him grief about that but i dont want to mess with him he might pull off one of those moves on me
7409619 billy blanks is my uncle and he still does all that tae bo workout stuff
7409620 i havent had to pull any of that out on the guys yet i know the moves but i keep that stuff under wraps
7409621 hes got good strength and even though hes not the tallest tackle in the world he makes up for it with his quickness and hes smart about the game its very rare when you have a true freshman come in and start right away but joe did that and hasnt looked back
7409622 he took a few lumps his freshman year but now coming in as a four year senior starter thats a big deal
7409623 we are pretty deep back there and thats great to see i just want everybody to mold together as a team its been a great four years and i want us to have a good season
7409624 its going to make for real interesting commentary and a lot of folks will really be enjoying that
7409625 but the great rivalries have been celebrated the first time nascar had a race that was recorded live the 1979 daytona 500 cale yarborough and the allison brothers got hair balled on the backstretch when things went bad to their mutual dissatisfaction
7409626 the rivalries have been something that have attracted interest and generated the positive and negative feelings of the fans and this has been a year when there really havent been any rivalries
7409627 darrell waltrip had his rivalries in his time and rusty wallace of course had his and this may be starting a new era
7409628 but we dont need to have rivalries to make the racing interesting were happy to race clean and celebrate a victory and not have a lot of discussion about it
7409629 well try to put this all behind us by the middle of next week before we go off to fontana but this will be talked about for a long time
7409630 i dont know if i like this new layout better than the old
7409631 i like them both the way the track was before and the way the track is now
7409632 i think the fans see more true racing on this surface rather than give and take and nudging people out of the way for every position
7409633 it is hard to pass extremely hard to pass but the track is small enough so theres always something going on
7409634 hell always come back and say hes sorry he did it at milwaukee and hes done it a few other times
7409635 thats fine ive grown to know that to pass a guy to hit him getting into the corners and chatter his tires that is what he did
7409636 i tried to get him back but thought better of it then i tried to pull down and pass him back but i didnt have a good enough car to stick and denny hamlin got to the outside and got by me and i had to battle with him
7409637 we were as clean as could be just one dude we had a problem with
7409638 he spun me out so i just got into him a little bit and let him know i didnt appreciate the way he passed me and he retaliated and ended up spinning me out
7409639 im to the point im content with how i race and how i am
7409640 for me its just go out there and do the best i can and accomplish the most i can
7409641 rivalries are just fine its fun to watch i know as a fan of other sports its always neat when theres something going on some story behind the scenes
7409642 but for me this doesnt change anything we go to california now and you just have to keep that in the back of your mind
7409643 all the guys running up front and kyle is a guy who exemplifies it he just drives the wheels off the thing you have to be that way
7409644 sometimes you have to do things like what happened here but everybody does it and im sure itll be done to me and this will be used against me but thats the way it is
7409645 honestly im not too worried about it i feel i was extremely justified to do what i did i needed to do it and thats the way it went
7409646 lets make it real clear im not apologizing for it and thats it
7409647 i feel the score is even it just cost him more than it cost me at the time
7409648 we might end up with some wadded up race cars
7409649 we feel good about california for sure after his spring win there but man these people are picking it up and the next two races leading to the playoff cut will be wild because there are more guys who dont have a lot to lose so people will be able to race pretty hard
7409650 listen if i could have passed kyle without running into him thats what i would have done
7409651 this is not the best way to do it but if i was a fan and could only pick one race to go to this one would be hard to overlook its pretty exciting
7409652 but seriously it was quite an honor and its really been an honor to be here at old town for so long
7409653 you compare back in time to watching the wake guys in the late 1980s they would all work or shape the ball
7409654 and some 15 years later all you see is them killing the ball and thats what equipment has done
7409655 when i first started out playing i was taught to swing slow and control the ball its changed in a big way and even our teaching has changed because now we teach kids to swing fast
7409656 there was a guy hitting golf balls on this field and i went over there to see who he was and what he was doing
7409657 it turns out the guys name was stan self thats when i first saw the game and you know what i ended up giving him lessons about 25 years later
7409658 hes kind of like a big brother coach and friend all wrapped into one hes just a classy guy and hes been there such a long time at old town its a good indication he must be pretty good
7409659 he was a friend of coach haddocks and wake forest and now with jerry haas thats kind of our home track and when we went there as players its nice to have a head pro thats really cool
7409660 billy is from rhode island and jerrys from illinois and they were out there playing and on the third hole i ran out there and told them to get off the course because of the frost
7409661 its funny but jerry still brings that up to this day
7409662 im very demanding on them because i want our members to have a great experience when they are out here so im tough on my assistants
7409663 when i interview them i tell them theres only one way in my eyes and thats the perfect way
7409664 this used to be kind of a sleepy little club but to watch all the changes here has been satisfying
7409665 interacting with this membership and seeing the junior players develop into adults and watching the progress on this golf course has been nice
7409666 just being here has been great and weve gotten some exposure being ranked in the top 100 by golf digest for classic courses so thats nice to see
7409667 i was on defense and a dude runs me over and gets 11 yards and they go on and win the game
7409668 his dad takes me to a field and tells me to put on all my pads in the pouring rain and says hit me
7409669 i was like what he says hit me a kid just ran you over and they won the game
7409670 we were out there in the pouring rain and he was saying hit me hit me hit me
7409671 then we come home and my moms like where have you all been
7409672 my dad takes off his shirt and hes got big bruises on his shoulder
7409673 she had a fit man she went nuts over that
7409674 my husband told me early on youve never been a guy so dont try to tell me what to do
7409675 no matter how great a mother i can be ill never be a father and no matter how great a father he can be hell never be a mother im clear about that
7409676 the bruises were pretty ugly i just thought he was crazy there was some lesson he obviously was trying to teach him that i wasnt going to get im not sure to this day that i really quite got it
7409677 me and my dad have a great relationship especially when it comes to football
7409678 he didnt want me to settle for just being good he always wanted me to be great at everything
7409679 he was the one who always pushed me saying dont settle for anything if you beat somebody dont beat them by a step beat them by a mile thats something that has stayed with me all my life
7409680 hes got kind of an uncanny knowledge of the game
7409681 he gets us lined up and has good speed to play in the throw game but hes a real physical kid hes real strong and runs the alley well and is really a physical tackler
7409682 i just had to ask myself would he do that to me and he has before so thats the way it goes
7409683 thats just the way it is its just racing i have a lot of respect for the guy and he was real fast but we cant give up points when theyre right there for us to take
7409684 the way this works a real smart racer explained it to me this way after hed wrecked me and i was real mad
7409685 he said i just had to look at your rear bumper and decide would you do this to me and you had before so it was a real simple decision
7409686 earlier in the year we had a nationwide race and kyle was a lot faster than me and he went ahead and got to my back bumper and just smoked the back bumper of my car and sent me up the racetrack afterward he said sorry man my car was just faster
7409687 so i had to ask myself when i went down there in the corner should i lift and brake early and do the best i can or should i just give him a little tap and see what happens so thats the way it went and thats the decision i made
7409688 he was mad and i can completely empathize with his anger
7409689 im in the company of some really really fast people and i can tell you that having fast race cars is one thing but being in the company of fast racers is another whole thing
7409690 carl had an opportunity and bob osborne his crew chief had an opportunity to work on the car
7409691 and until it came time for carl to reach out and take a chance on using his car up it was going to be a follow the leader deal because theres an advantage to being in front when youre behind you just dont quite have the option you do when youre in front
7409692 so it came down to carl having a little bit better car on the short run and it came down to carl wanting it bad enough to go get it it was there in front of him and he took it
7409693 will it be a carbon copy or in the spirit of dr strangelove or will it be real heavy
7409694 much respect to spain but the u s is back on top again
7409695 we played with great character in one of the great games in international basketball history i think
7409696 i know that we had a tough road ahead of us we knew that these guys werent going to roll over and give up that easily
7409697 so we had to be men and thats what it takes to win
7409698 being a part of the 04 team we really didnt get the opportunity to showcase our talent
7409699 we really wanted to come in and help lead this team
7409700 hey asshole touch this bike and ill appear from the bushes ready to club you with a two by four
7409701 glanz l sst sich in der praxis der anstrichtechnik ebenso wenig durch worte oder zahlen ausdr cken wie farbe
7409702 might not know the details but i think they see that hes full of dignity a warrior who believed that he could fight for the helpless you know theres an element of batman to the guy
7409703 then he went back down to south america to start from zero again he didnt sell out
7409704 he never bombed caf s or stores he fought against armies usually stronger and bigger than him you know even batman had to kill some bad guys
7409705 money enhanced individualism but diminished communal motivations an effect that is still apparent in peoples responses today
7409706 these have been a good games very good for china
7409707 what the fuck who is this charlie kaufman and whats wrong with him
7409708 maybe you shouldnt be afraid maybe youre just hurtling toward your ideal to lose control
7409709 i wasnt able to accomplish what i really wanted which was to stay healthy
7409710 but any time you can overcome an injury and throw up zeros its nice
7409711 a couple of outings in a row joey has thrown the ball real well
7409712 theyve pulled off a masterstroke here there are plenty of hacked company databases for sale online but the sheer volume and quality of the information that has been stolen in the best western raid makes this particularly rare
7409713 the russian gangs who specialise in this kind of work will have been exploiting the information from the moment it became available late on thursday night in the wrong hands theres enough data there to spark a major european crime wave
7409714 large corporate companies rely on anti virus products to protect their infrastructure but the problem with this approach is that these products only detect around 60 per cent of threats out there in the right hands viruses can easily bypass these programs as was the case here
7409715 we all are of the opinion that we don t want a change in leadership says independent mla stephen marandi
7409716 were working on it now which hasnt been officially announced it will be released in 2010
7409717 post olympics china is slowing not because the olympics are over but because of global forces
7409718 chinas macro statistics are going to look terrible the rest of this year and into 2009 china wants to act and supporting the growth rate is going to be overwhelmingly the top policy priority
7409719 our view is that the administration has a number of levers they can pull in the attempt to keep growth around 10 percent in the second half and into next year
7409720 in terms of economic growth it doesnt have any impact
7409721 were going down from stupidly fast last year to really fast this year and just plain ordinary fast next year which would be in the 8 9 percent range
7409722 its a big down shift and that may create some problems but theyll still be growing faster than any other major economy in the world

7409730 ncdex is looking at various opportunities beyond the agri commodities and have started recently carbon futures which is doing well
7409731 on the hiking trails how you can choose the best one
7409732 yeah i went to a few sex addiction meetings but ive had my own history ive been to prostitutes and massage parlours and stuff back in the old days so i understand the mindset a little
7409733 when i started not the movie but the preparation my english was just awful
7409734 the challenge was to work in english without a french accent and it was a big deal for me because well its always great to work in english but when you have to leave your french accent on the side its really not easy i had five months of preparation that was big it was really big and id never done that before it was every day
7409735 i did some aikido for a few months just for the fighting scene even if in the movie we dont see a lot of physical things for the aurora character at least its just like three movements but i repeated them for a long long long time
7409736 i think the interesting thing i learned is i found my character when i found her voice
7409737 for me her character it was in english i didnt think in french at all it was really hard for me when i had to dub in french the movie because for me aurora her language was english and its completely different i worked and worked and worked on the english on the accent and one day i felt something round in my mouth and something happened and you discover great i found her voice its not mine anymore its her voice and then everything comes and you discover in her body how she moves and its very moving to have this kind of double personality its not schizophrenia but its something so new
7409738 were working on it now which hasnt been officially announced it will be released in 2010
7409739 trends in the charitable marketplace growth competition and rising demand to build capacity
7409740 shes got seven seconds max to make a first impression
7409741 its unfortunate but if you wear a suit to a job interview you are more likely to have the job
7409742 but just the change in posture and the way she holds herself from the time she comes in to the time she leaves is amazing
7409743 when she comes in here i want her to feel special like this is not a hand me down place
7409744 its kind of like a gym you can be a member anywhere
7409745 northgate is that community mall anyway so this is just a part of being committed to the community
7409746 for pure enjoyment the bible has got some of the greatest mysteries love stories soap operas of any book ever written
7409747 its probably the greatest book on life and leadership ever written
7409748 even as a young person i preferred the krispy kreme
7409749 doctors nurses and other medical personnel face pressure to participate in abortion a practice that many find abhorrent in good conscience
7409750 the enforcement of federal laws designed to protect their freedom of conscience is long overdue
7409751 this is not just about catholic health care catholics do not stand alone in opposition to the deliberate destruction of nascent human life all health care providers should be free to serve their patients without violating their most deeply held moral and religious convictions on the value of life
7409752 organizations calling themselves pro choice are actually pro coercion in seeking to deny the freedom of doctors and nurses
7409753 dont doctors have the right to choose not to participate
7409754 over the coming thirty days of public comment the bishops urge the pro life american public to thank secretary leavitt and encourage hhs to implement the strongest possible regulations
7409755 christs faithful have the right indeed at times the duty in keeping with their knowledge competence and position to manifest to the sacred pastors their views on matters which concern the good of the church they have the right also to make their views known to others of christs faithful but in doing so they must always respect the integrity of faith and morals show due reverence to the pastors and take into account both the common good and the dignity of individuals
7409756 the catholic church is the only thing which saves a man from the degrading slavery of being a child of his age
7409757 it was eerie but on the other hand when looking at it from stauffenbergs viewpoint and what he did and what these men did it was powerful
7409758 as an actor i think i can say for all of us who were there that we felt fortunate to get those locations and shoot at those places it really changes the performances to do it there at that spot
7409759 these guys are true american patriots they were fighting two wars
7409760 they were fighting the nazis the fascists in europe and fighting the japanese in the pacific and they were fighting jim crow racism prejudice in the united states of america at the same time
7409761 i love the idea of it it applied to where bond was at the end of the last movie
7409762 the one thing he didnt have with the relationship was that quantum of solace
7409763 its rare where you get a piece of material thats politically pertinent like this but also sort of non preachy and engaging entertainment for an audience
7409764 he doesnt want to be a monster he doesnt want to kill people
7409765 he loves her but if he gets too passionate he will want her blood he will want to kill her
7409766 doing those type of scenes is always a bit strange never mind a husband but an entire crew watching you
7409767 this was two lone wolves its a duel two complicated fascinating really brilliant people
7409768 for men with their histories their intelligence their egos a contest like this really did become kind of life and death
7409769 they say it in the piece there can be only one winner
7409770 were telling it while hes still in office which has never been done
7409771 the bush family is a political dynasty in america its the closest thing we have to a political dynasty other than john adams and john quincy adams weve never had father and son presidents like this before
7409772 the set decoration is insane and beautiful to think in the first movie we only had a ladder
7409773 everythings bigger from details like the wardrobe because of how big the screen is and the musical numbers are so much bigger
7409774 he believes hes only got a short time to live and that hes come down with this disease so hes kind of convinced hes got to get up the nerve to tell her how he feels before he dies
7409775 i just let the program run till the end of the music i felt reluctant to interfere too much by trying to sculpt an ending and just let the code run its own natural course
7409776 as i read this quote so many different thoughts come to my mind like how the hell can someone say that then i think maybe he is so right just maybe we have missed the point of church is it this instituion where me meet to hear some guy tell us his thoughts is it a building where we meet like a country club or is it about holding up signs and damning every soul to hell is it a place where only christians meet if you study the life and teachings of christ who is the husband of the church you find that he was a person god who loved everyone he didnt play favorites he came with this message of love freedom peace he came to break the standards of religious regulations his heart wasnt to come to bring another religion we have enough he came to give us a relationship with god b c the fact is i can never earn my way to god but for some reason thats what we think we say we dont we say we are about love and the things of god but thats if u believe what we believe b c for some odd reason we as christians seem to think we only have this figured out we seem to think we understand god but isnt god bigger than our understanding isnt god this mysterious being who has revield himself to us but not all and i dont understand why we make ppl feel like crap if they dont understand in the book of john 14 15 jesus says if you love me obey me
7409777 kind knight you attempt to conquer this restless mare but youre no different to me
7409778 ive heard that the bookies are offering odds of 4 7 on britain getting more medals next time and the same odds of us beating australia
7409779 im sure the aussies will pour everything into avoid that but i think the gb will still come out on top
7409780 it has been frustrating we almost hit the target but you dont get medals for close
7409781 but weve got some fantastic young athletes and theres real promise for 2012 its just going to take time
7409782 as we move up to it we want more and more young people in britain interested in sport
7409783 together so that they can work with edf to build nuclear sites
7409784 youre blessed when youre at the end of your rope with less of you there is more of god and his rule
7409785 youre blessed when youve worked up a good appetite for god
7409786 matt daniels looks like he will be able to contribute on defense
7409787 i expect to see trent mackey get some time on special teams and eventually make it at the linebacker
7409788 johnny williams has certainly set a strong pace at receiver hes been one of our leading receivers in every scrimmage weve had
7409789 hollingsworth is getting a lot of snaps at running back we have major concerns in that area i think that jay continues to get himself ready to play

7409792 music measures the temperature of the people consumerism and the corporate media have taken us all down the path of cynicism apathy and nihilism if the message on the new record is anything its to blast that shit
7409793 who knows but that on the lower frequencies i speak for you
7409794 its only natural in this world to i need to
7409795 this is the road to heaven i see the harbor and i am sure that the tempests will not stop me from reaching it
7409796 anybody who knows me knows thats probably more my mind set
7409797 when you have all those guys out there you force the defense to cover the entire field then we find those running holes now if youre a traditional power football team not everybody has the players to do that a team like michigan maybe can do that
7409798 i picked the spread because i think its a very dynamic offense
7409799 it will allow us to recruit great football players thats a huge part of the deal
7409800 he brought in a whole new concept to the big ten as to what we could do
7409801 joe came in and he started to open up offenses and created a lot of problems and we in coaching are all people that are mimics
7409802 right now in college football the spread is spreading all over the country
7409803 because its effective the big ten is no different you incorporate what works and what works now is a spread offense with a quarterback who can throw it and run it for a defense its impossible to account for a quarterback who can run or throw from a spread look
7409804 young people like to throw and catch and run around and high five each other and enjoy having fun playing the game if you want to keep them involved in the sport of football you have to provide an outlet that is enjoyable to them
7409805 i often refer to our society as being an instant gratification society so the offense just fits in
7409806 the thing i like about being at wisconsin right now is that were unique
7409807 five years ago when the spread first started coming into the league you needed preparation versus those teams now wisconsin is unique you line up with a fullback and tailback and have some big ugly guys in front that come downhill now people have to go into a certain preparation mode against wisconsin which to me is an advantage
7409808 if wisconsin goes out and wins it maybe well go back to power football
7409809 right now there is a real emphasis on the spread the spread is proving to be an outstanding offense at some point that will turn back again there are great minds on the defensive side of the ball they will make their adjustments get better at defending it

7409840 none of those guys has really played before so it would be tough to only go with two guys who have played before

7409847 you really think all nuns are old stunted and sad this isnt the case any more thanks to the arrival in our country of young and vital nuns notably from africa and latin america

7409879 you are unbearably cute when you do that you know
7409880 or did you badger my mom into spilling her guts
7409881 im introducing you to my friend kyle and his girlfriend annabette
7409882 he was with this dog of a girl like four months ago i swear i thought i would puke
7409883 he still cares about me as more then a friend but really the love is purely platonic at this point

7409923 if recent russian actions are any indicator a technical excuse to completely block us access to the iss for geopolitical reasons would fit nicely into the kremlin toolkit
7409924 almost immediately after the czech republic signed an agreement with the us to place missile defense tracking radar in its territory oil supplies through the to the central european country were reduced to a trickle ostensibly for technical reasons
7409925 in an election year it was going to be very difficult to get that waiver to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to an increasingly aggressive russia
7409926 degrade and burn up on rentry or with us ceding it to those who can get there
7409927 if anything at all in that five years period goes wrong with the russian soyuz then we have no system to access the space station
7409928 while it is possible that government to government issues could potentially have an impact on other aspects of a relationship between nations including cooperative space exploration activities nasa believes that it will be able to rely upon roscosmos provided soyuz vehicles for
7409929 as long as russia can be said to be abiding by the terms of the cease fire in georgia
7409930 there is an issue but i dont think its so strong to prevent the waiver from passing as long as russian behavior is what it has been agreed to on georgia
7409931 if scientific conclusions contradict the word of god the conclusions are wrong
7409932 instructs that the bible is the unerring source for analysis of historical events
7409933 it appears the uc is attempting to secularize private religious schools
7409934 science courses from a religious perspective are not approved if it comes from certain publishers or from a religious perspective uc simply denies them
7409935 confirms that uc may apply the same admissions standards to all students and to all high schools without regard to their religious affiliations
7409936 around 10 00 p m moscow time an unknown gunman opened fire with a kalashnikov on a police patrol in the center of makhachkala two police officers died a third is in hospital in a critical condition the attacker was killed
7409937 monetary incentives for accurate prediction ameliorate the planning fallacy while incentives for rapid completion aggravate it
7409938 both more left wing and more right wing than many people realize
7409939 she had to think very practically about how do you make money
7409940 how does the system work that led me to have an orientation to ask hardheaded questions during my formative years there was still ideological competition between a social democratic or even socialist agenda and a free market milton friedman agenda i think it was natural for me to ask questions of both sides and maybe try to synthesize approaches
7409941 reagans central insight that the liberal welfare state had grown complacent and overly bureaucratic with democratic policy makers more obsessed with slicing the economic pie than with growing that pie contained a good deal of truth
7409942 i like to think of him as a university of chicago democrat
7409943 okay or yes honey dear sweetie or any other term of affection
7409944 thanks for the reminder ill get right on it as soon as i am sure youre not looking
7409945 in christianity neither morality nor religion come into contact with reality at any point
7409946 the underlying objective must be the restoration of stability with the minimum of destruction so that society and lawful government may proceed in an atmosphere of justice and order
7409947 we have not had one second of problem as a coaching staff with our team
7409948 weve been joined at the hip for the last three years
7409949 i never expected to be kissed by coach k but that was a great moment
7409950 i want to thank coach k for believing in me and ive told him that
7409951 he was the one who believed in me coming back to this team
7409952 we dont run too many plays we just spread the floor break guys down and share the ball
7409953 as much as i would like to drive we can always use that gas money for something else
7409954 i do philosophically believe that gas prices will impact our ridership
7409955 it keeps the number of car poolers down it creates less traffic its better for the environment
7409956 it puts your teachers on duty for a longer time when they have duties after school and just requires more supervision
7409957 shes got seven seconds max to make a first impression
7409958 its unfortunate but if you wear a suit to a job interview you are more likely to have the job
7409959 but just the change in posture and the way she holds herself from the time she comes in to the time she leaves is amazing
7409960 when she comes in here i want her to feel special like this is not a hand me down place
7409961 its kind of like a gym you can be a member anywhere
7409962 northgate is that community mall anyway so this is just a part of being committed to the community
7409963 theyre like youre not cleaning our toilet pastor and he was like yes i am
7409964 money wasnt the most important thing to him thats for sure
7409965 if we were telling people they should carry their baby we wanted to be there for them
7409966 it would be in the mailbox a formal invitation for dinner a date with dad
7409967 the girls always knew we came first that they couldnt play us against each other
7409968 dont get me wrong we fought and hollered at each other we were normal but they always knew we loved each other
7409969 i guess thats the last date youll go on with him
7409970 ive been working in river programs for 27 years and ive never seen the river this low
7409971 i cant predict the weather but if conditions persist stream levels are going to stay low
7409972 people dont know too much about how rivers respond to drought
7409973 what is happening now is everything that lives there is being squeezed into a smaller and smaller space the less water there is there is less oxygen in the water and the fish are going to be stressed because of that
7409974 it was just getting lower and lower and lower it was just getting to the point where it was obvious that the river was handicapped
7409975 its just not a river trip we want to sell to these people
7409976 if now is not the right time to be looking at long term solutions then i dont know what is
7409977 if the lowest levels of water ever cant raise peoples awareness then i dont know what will
7409978 im not going to pretend im one of you because im not and neither is my opponent
7409979 i actually consider myself part of the agriculture community in north carolina
7409980 im not a johnny come lately to rural north carolina or to agriculture and agribusiness
7409981 national washington group and labor unions and other groups from throughout the country
7409982 the 30 second tv ads which now attack me by this washington labor group are saying that im opposed to free two year college tuition and therefore im against students im against kids
7409983 this has nothing to do with endorsements by quasi labor unions
7409984 my opponent says that childrens health care insurance sends the wrong signal
7409985 they know theyre going to get free medical care for their children
7409986 were sending the wrong signals by our government programs right now
7409987 i dont know where she got that quote from and i look forward to seeing it some day and im sure its out of context like many of the negative ads from national washington groups and labor unions
7409988 i in no way meant that i would want to take away health insurance from children
7409989 employees hours and work from home options are flexible in extenuating circumstances
7409990 for example when one staffers husband was sick she was encouraged to use a flexible schedule to balance family and work obligations and when another employee had a difficult pregnancy confining her to bed rest her home was set up so she could work remotely
7409991 i sounded a lot like boomhauer from king of the hill with everah thang runnin tuhgetha in monotone
7409992 i started correcting myself to sound more midwestern and a bad thing turned into a good thing
7409993 i was teaching tae kwon do and got into a really bad car accident when i was 18
7409994 a student asked if id ever considered radio and i got hired as an intern at a station that happened to be right next to radio disney
7409995 i got to meet the people who do voices for mickey and minnie mouse donald duck and all of these amazing disney voice actors
7409996 when i was allowed to just be me i was fine
7409997 several times i thought id had enough pulling my hair out
7409998 he once had me doing an exercise where i was an old lady and i had to scream a lot and i nearly blacked out
7409999 its fun to push yourself and see what you can do
