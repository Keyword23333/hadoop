9070000 ill tell people in my columns look this is what you need to do but theyre still going to need the products to do it and thats what they see in those ads
9070001 international reply coupons can be exchanged by the addressee for a stamp to prepay air mail postage on a small letter up to 50g anywhere in the world
9070002 i spoke to our po people today and they have told me pretty much what you said
9070003 german mail service will only charge you the postage for sending within germany for quote
9070004 i live in rome and i first asked for information at the vatican post office since they are generally more trustworthy than the italian mail system they can send packages to apo addresses at the same cost as sending packages to the states but the only problem is that vatican postal regulations require that they tie the packages with string and i had read somewhere i think on this website that string isnt allowed so unfortunately dont use the vatican except for letters 80 euro cents luckily the italian post office i went to outside of the vatican walls knew about apo addresses and told me the same information the packages can be sent at the same rate as sending to the states however a couple of tips to keep in mind the packages must be less than 2 kilos in weight and for some reason if you go over 135 grams for one package they charge you the price for 1 kilo sounds suspicious but i think the postal clerk was being honest in this case so try to keep your packages small and light i sent 4 packages using priority mail and 3 of them came out to 8 50 the 4th was the heavier one at 16 50 as far as if they will ever arrive incrociamo le dita as they say here lets keep our fingers crossed shelley
9070005 i tried posting a small packet to my penpal in iraq addressing it with usa at the end of the address which had an apo beginning ae it arrived in iraq about 12 days later and the friend in question commented it was quicker than things he ever got from the us which got me thinking i sent a cheap postcard to the same address only with germany at the end of the address instead of usa and it arrived in iraq 12 days later as airmail to europe is half the cost of airmail to the us thats led to two happy penpals i can afford to send more often and he can get a little more moral boosting as a result
9070006 so i sent a parcel to him addressing it to germany instead of the us and it arrived safely enough as such id suggest the following advice to anyone posting from the uk if the apo begins ae write germany at the end of the address instead of usa ask the post office to send it airmail and insist on a cn22 customs label to stick on the parcel they may say you dont need it for germany i simply explained it was being sent to a us military base and they insisted on a customs label being attached and the lady was fine et voila hopefully a couple of weeks later the parcel is in iraq at half the price you would have paid
9070007 i mean these guys and gals have other things on their minds yknow like oh staying alive
9070008 im pleased to see some of you with very solid focus here today
9070009 i know this subject can be hard and some of you are clearly frustrated but are keeping at it anyway and so special kudos to you
9070010 for those of you who have never done this before thank you for giving me and this subject your time and attention and willingness
9070011 if competition for power is the lifeblood of democracy then the search for bi partisan consensus is really collusion in restraint of democracy why is it that people do not challenge legislation that has bi partisan backing or other forms of bi partisan agreement on grounds it is far from clear that there are fewer meritorious reasons to break up the democratic and republican parties than there are to break up at amp t and microsoft
9070012 youve won according to the rules of the game we dont like that stop it
9070013 it reflects a political strategy and an effective one i might add
9070014 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
9070015 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
9070016 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters now is who uses that language for what purpose
9070017 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
9070018 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
9070019 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
9070020 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
9070021 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
9070022 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
9070023 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
9070024 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
9070025 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
9070026 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
9070027 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
9070028 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
9070029 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
9070030 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
9070031 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
9070032 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
9070033 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
9070034 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
9070035 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
9070036 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
9070037 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
9070038 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
9070039 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
9070040 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
9070041 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
9070042 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
9070043 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
9070044 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
9070045 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
9070046 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
9070047 politics depends to a great extent on judging what is actual relative to what is possible however we have an inherently weak grasp of what is possible and most societies are not set up so as naturally to improve this or to make us aware of possibilities we may have ignored or taken with insufficient seriousness
9070048 yes i am in a bad mood no it is nothing to do with you yes i will get over it understand good lets go on with the lesson
9070049 mccain declared as the pair stood together for the first time at a boisterous rally in
9070050 im going to take our campaign to every part of our country and our message of reform to every voter of every background in every political party or no party at all
9070051 politics isnt just a game of competing interests and clashing parties
9070052 by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9070053 we should all be proud of s historic nomination and i congratulate her and sen mccain while their policies would take america in the gov palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9070054 he sees sarah governor palin as the future of the party
9070055 these are people hed like to elevate in that regard reformers
9070056 id like to know more about her experience if something happened to him would she be qualified to step into the presidency
9070057 los yukpas est n recuperando sus territorios ancestrales est n exigiendo su derecho a la tierra
9070058 hay una vulnerabilidad de los derechos humanos de los yukpas
9070059 se deben movilizar para cumplir con lo que es una orientaci n gubernamental y exigencia de la constituci n nacional
9070060 es la hora de la nueva independencia no perdamos tiempo
9070061 i treat this matter delicately because this person needs privacy
9070062 our binocular region is a kind of spotlight shining through the clutter allowing us to visually sweep out a cluttered region to recognize the objects beyond it
9070063 as long as the separation between our eyes is wider than the width of the objects causing clutter as is the case with our fingers or would be the case with the leaves in the forest then we can tend to see through it
9070064 non leafy surroundings or surroundings where the cluttering objects are bigger in size than the separation between the animals eyes
9070065 animals outside of leafy environments do not have to deal with clutter no matter how big or small they are so there is never any x ray advantage to forward facing eyes for them
9070066 because binocular vision does not help them see any better than monocular vision they are able to survey a much greater region with sideways facing eyes
9070067 this x ray vision makes it possible for animals with forward facing eyes to visually survey a much greater region around themselves than sideways facing eyes would allow
9070068 additionally the larger the animal in a cluttered environment the more forward facing its eyes will be to allow for the greatest x ray vision possible in order to aid in hunting running from predators and maneuvering through dense forest or jungle
9070069 in todays world humans have more in common visually with tiny mice in a forest than with a large animal in the jungle we arent faced with a great deal of small clutter and the things that do clutter our visual field cars and skyscrapers are much wider than the separation between our eyes so we cant use our x ray power to see through them
9070070 if we froze ourselves today and woke up a million years from now its possible that it might be difficult for us to look the new human population in the eye because by then they might be facing sideways
9070071 now im feeling like a kid again thats why the albums called
9070072 we are very excited about the start of the red wolves football season this year
9070073 the students play a vital role in the game day atmosphere and this event will kick off the red wolves spirit
9070074 there was no indication on the putting green when i was warming up that was going to tell me it was going to be like that
9070075 it just felt normal just one of those days where i made about a 15 footer on the first hole another on the second hole i just kind of built on that momentum
9070076 i just tried to keep the pedal down because i knew the scores were pretty low
9070077 its been kind of my goal the last moth or so to get off to better starts in tournaments
9070078 it seems like ive been having to come from behind ive just put it in my to try to get off to a better start obviously this was way exceeding my expectations
9070079 its nuts i dont think theyve got it right quite yet
9070080 how can you have a double major winner not make the tour championship thats complete nonsense
9070081 it was one of the rare days it did feel like that
9070082 but it was one of those days with my putter i hadnt had in a while so it was fun
9070083 im going to take our campaign to every part of our country and our message of reform to every voter of every background in every political party or no party at all
9070084 politics isnt just a game of competing interests and clashing parties
9070085 the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience
9070086 nobody knew about his announcement this morning except a traveling aide and the governors chief of staff who found out about this last night
9070087 it was rightly noted in denver this week that hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9070088 ready to tax ready to spend not ready to lead
9070089 tengo quince d as de descanso me voy a revisar las rodillas ya que tengo algunas molestias y de encontrarme bien comenzar a a entrenar la pr xima semana
9070090 la estrategia que delinean estos dos mandatarios es la que necesita am rica del sur los pueblos necesitan unirse defender su soberan a y demostrar que s podemos sostener a nuestras propias industrias

9070092 los venezolanos s podemos tener la sider rgica en las mejores condiciones porque los trabajadores perciben lo mejor de su planta
9070093 el socialismo que pregona el presidente ch vez es grande bueno para el pueblo
9070094 es demasiado importante la nacionalizaci n principalmente para los trabajadores hemos visto un cambio radical en esta empresa porque realmente nos ten an sometidos la trasnacional ahora tenemos m s tiempo para compartir con nuestros seres queridos
9070095 un ejemplo para todos los dem s mandatarios a que el camino es la unidad y la integraci n de proyectos visiones y perspectivas de los pueblos
9070096 a ra z de la nacionalizaci n nosotros hemos visto la alegr a el gozo y la emoci n
9070097 i think republicans are more accustomed to following the rules
9070098 were used to sitting in the cheap seats weve got binoculars
9070099 they say having kids at my age either makes you or breaks you and im leaning heavily toward break right now
9070100 as soon as the alarm goes off i am jumping up with a level of excitement because i never know what the day holds
9070101 meetings for me are very short just get to the point and then react on it
9070102 in these challenging times we are making sure that if there is a slight increase in price there is an enhancement in the luxury of it we are classified as affordable luxury
9070103 getting an update on how the collection is going and going through any day to day issues
9070104 we are a very sexy business with enormous growth potential
9070105 i have always been very hands on with key departments and the hub of the business
9070106 once you are in the heart of a meeting you dont stop and reconvene it is that level of intensity that everyone in the building is fired up
9070107 we are opening lots of stores there are so many things going on around the world
9070108 if i have a spare hour i pop out to visit the store to make sure i am happy with the product and that the brand is going forward if there is anything i am not happy with i immediatelylet people know
9070109 asos has put down some very big orders for spring summer and we get approached all the time from people who want to do tie ups with us
9070110 the one thing about retail is that businesses can go up and down in a very short space of time it is the excitement of pushing the brand forward
9070111 supporting arsenal is a big release for me i have always been interested in sport
9070112 we are revising lower our estimates expected residential mortgage and other asset write downs weaker investment banking revenues and lower trading revenues our lehman brothers estimate revisions are the most stark and given the uncertain recovery we have also lowered 2009 estimates
9070113 a decline in group ebitda earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation below 465m 9 per cent below our 2009 tenanted ebita estimate would result in the comp any breaching its bank debt covenants
9070114 feasible on scenarios involving a combination of a considerable decline in beer sales and substantial tenant support
9070115 its vague and no one believes it the shares are up with the rest of the sector
9070116 todays performance will leave many traders eyeing the 5 700 mark as the next objective for the ftse
9070117 be surprised if the swiss group makes an offer at this time due to potential anti trust issues in uk commercial
9070118 recent share price increases are a reflection of the removal of the extreme fear of backruptucy in our opinion but any fundamental performance is likely correlated to mortgage securitisation growth which we believe is unlikely before mid 2009 at best
9070119 we had boarded the flight and sat for an hour and a half
9070120 we then had to disembark the pilot was left to tell all the passengers there would no longer be a flight and the reasons why
9070121 we are desperately sorry for the inconvenience and disappointment that this will cause passengers and those who have booked flights
9070122 the other airlines are quoting 2 500 and we just cant do it
9070123 we appreciate that airlines go bust but what i object to is that baa would have known about this and didnt let us know
9070124 the closure of zoom does seem a little ahead of schedule especially as oil prices have been falling recently
9070125 if anything we may see prices come down as airlines compete for customers in order to make it through winter
9070126 weve made this decision reluctantly especially as household budgets are being squeezed there is help for people who cant pay their bills and we want customers to get in touch if theyre worried
9070127 we understand the impact this announcement will have on our customers we have worked very hard to protect people for as long as possible from considerable increases in the wholesale market

9070138 as soon as you feel youre going to have a problem you need to pick up your mortgage statement call the phone number on it and ask the folks on the other side of the line what they can do to help you out
9070139 suppose you have an adjustable rate mortgage that is going to adjust up they can freeze it or even lower the interest rate to keep your payments down
9070140 going forward saving is going to be very important over the last 20 to 25 years weve had a nice tailwind behind us in the form of lower inflation and interest rates and thats helped push stock values and housing prices up and made us all wealthier we can no longer count on that and its going to be much more important for people to save in a disciplined way
9070141 force you to change your routine you slow down and begin to reflect on your life whats happened over the past year where youre heading feeling hungry connects you to whats important to you what you really want we get so busy sometimes that we forget what its all about it feels good to take back the drivers seat rather than letting life drive you
9070142 the family comes together and dedicates several hours just to eating no one has to rush off anywhere you just sit around the table eat slowly and spend time together you have some of your favorite foods and everyone feels fulfilled and happy
9070143 i feel it myself i get so busy with work meetings everything that i barely have time to eat thats why its so important to me to take a break during this time and sit down to a leisurely meal
9070144 when i was growing up we always had something fried such as samosas or pakoras the chickpea curry known as cholay and a sweet such as gulab jamun milk balls soaked in syrup
9070145 you just eat and eat and eat the main dish might be a lamb or chicken curry accompanied by basmati rice therell be a vegetable side dish such as cauliflower with potatoes or lentil dhal and for dessert a pakistani halwah different from arabic sesame based halvah this is made from semolina or carrots or more gulab jamun there might also be shami kebabs seasoned ground beef patties with poori deep fried puffed bread and in the summer fresh fruit such as mangoes
9070146 all the women will discuss what theyll be wearing where to shop
9070147 he would prepare breakfast then gently knock on our doors to wake us
9070148 wed have eggs either fried or made into an omelet paratha layered wheat bread and sometimes leftovers such as samosas or shami kebabs from the night before for dessert wed have jalebi bright orange deep fried batter in sugar syrup the cook would soak it in milk overnight so it would be soft and soothing for breakfast
9070149 when i lived in pakistan it was a bit easier to observe ramadan
9070150 in muslim countries everything changes during this month businesses and schools open earlier and then close in the early afternoon so you can go home and prepare for iftar shops also close in the afternoon and then reopen late into the night so you can shop after the meal is over here in america its harder but i still keep the traditions with my children
9070151 tiny black nigella seeds add a subtle nutty flavor and fragrance to the dough
9070152 but if you cant find them they can be replaced by black sesame seeds or left out
9070153 be sure to use warm not cold water you want the dough to stay soft and pliable
9070154 the clear flavor will really shine through in the finished dish youll find simple instructions for making this in the recipe
9070155 if you soak and cook them yourself theyll absorb the spices much better
9070156 i like to soak and cook a large amount of chickpeas at one time then freeze the extras in small batches when pressed for time you can easily defrost a batch and use it for whatever youre cooking
9070157 be sure to cook the meat until its very dry you want all the water to evaporate
9070158 you also want to press somewhat firmly when forming them
9070159 the larger black pods might be more difficult they add a hint of smoky flavor but in a pinch they can be left out
9070160 there is extensive debris at the site and it will take possibly several weeks to complete this part of the investigation
9070161 no deposition by the proprietor of the registered estate is to be registered except under a further order
9070162 thats what i think every time i tuck my children up at night
9070163 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine these are my heroes
9070164 if john mccain to have a debate about who has the temperament to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
9070165 let us agree that patriotism has no party so ive got news for you we all put our country first
9070166 that poor woman has gone through so much this is unbelievable the purcells are in our thoughts and prayers we are just shocked
9070167 i have been looking for a running mate that will shake up washington
9070168 we can shatter the glass ceiling once and for all
9070169 john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy a heartbeat away from the presidency
9070170 i do not know too much about her but maybe that is good news
9070171 n o a conheci mas parece ser algu m fascinante com uma hist ria pessoal extraordin ria

9070176 gustav could become a major hurricane before reaching western cuba
9070177 we have no intention of keeping our troops in security zones around south ossetia and abkhazia for the long term
9070178 we will also help south ossetia secure its own border
9070179 it is us who would have initiated this war which we did not do
9070180 i have brought you t master it took quite a lot of searching on your galaxys non holographic communications network but no man is beyond the reach of a sith
9070181 what the heck who is he and why can he sometimes see my visions
9070182 nascar is a sport that is sponsor dependent i know gem has been working hard to find sponsorship im amazed that they found all the sponsorship this year
9070183 for sure its a shock to learn someone else is taking your spot but they are still working to get a fourth car a lot of teams want to go to four cars and this is one of them hopefully it works out if it doesnt for me its a bonus ive enjoyed the year very much and i hope to drive for many years
9070184 all the guys who arent in the top 35 in owner points are going to have high interest but well see what happens
9070185 in this sport you never know every ride is sponsorship dependent now teams are searching for sponsors and are a little bit hungrier because money is a little bit more scarce than what its been before because of the economy
9070186 last year we had really good timing with majority owner george gillett and the canadiens and the car so everything worked out this year timing isnt as good but hopefully well get to work it out
9070187 they use to sponsor me in champ car and because of my personality and where i was from it fit the bill perfectly so i got a ride for nine years this time im on the other side and im the one getting the boot its part of racing im not pissed off i kind of expected it
9070188 would you want your parents to have the most demanding job in the world at 72
9070189 all that stuff doesnt matter were here to race and the racings been pretty good its been real good i think ive just been having a good time with it
9070190 when hes won this year ive congratulated him when ive won hes congratulated me thats why all this stuff this week i kind of got a chuckle out of it because i know deep down what he says doesnt matter to me and what i say doesnt really matter to him what really matters is we race well on the race track id say that well be fine
9070191 its very cool to have our team running so well to be on top of our game
9070192 its really fun to have somebody like kyle thats so fast and there have been a couple races where its been me or him i think that brings out the best in a lot of people for us its been a lot of fun add comment
9070193 intrigued with a politician who will do something thats out of the box
9070194 might still be captive to the social conservatives and couldnt pick a v p nominee that was outside of that box
9070195 she palin directly invited a comparison with hillary clinton i think thats a mistake the reason women liked hillary clinton was because they sort of got the first qualified woman ever to be a presidential candidate i dont think you can just you know change skirts and put it on another woman and have it be an acceptable thing
9070196 i think in some respects its almost dismissive of women to suggest that its just about gender and shes going to have to answer that and shes invited that comparison herself
9070197 i do now have to tell alaskans that such pressure could have been perceived to exist although i have only now become aware of it
9070198 many of these inquiries were completely appropriate however the serial nature of the contacts could be perceived as some kind of pressure presumably at my direction
9070199 are those professionals going to feel compelled to be subpoenaed before they will speak candidly about what they know
9070200 weve got the doors locked down and theres no one on the playground
9070201 these stay right here soandso this is your cubby and your crayons will be here for you when you come back tomorrow
9070202 is this really who the republican party wants to be one heartbeat away from the presidency given sarah palins lack of experience on every front and on nearly every issue this vice presidential pick doesnt show judgment it shows political panic
9070203 i do believe that mccain has to do something to reshuffle the cards shake up the establishment do something unexpected and governor palin has all the kinds of things that mccain might see as a way to shake things up i think her selection would be something similar to dan quayle dan quayle proved to be sort of an embarrassment as a campaigner being thrust on a national stage like that could be very tough now mondale tried to shake things up by going with geraldine ferraro she proved to be a disaster as a running mate and as a campaigner she was absolutely awful and so i just think that it is very risky for mccain to do this but it may be all he has left
9070204 we send our congratulations to governor sarah palin and her family on her designation as the republican nominee for vice president it is yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward governor palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9070205 at one point this week police in denver had a showdown with over 300 protestors ended up pepper spraying them and since of course it was denver and they were democrats it was only fresh ground pepper spray
9070206 well there was a rumor that mccain might pick former ebay ceo meg whitman as his running mate that makes sense you know shes an expert at selling americans really old stuff
9070207 former president bill clinton spoke at the convention last night

9070220 to each his dharma his station his duty like you and me a woman and man each with our part to play in this life like truth like god thats all theres no asking why
9070221 when we can accept that which is done that which is given therein lies ones love of god therein lies true devotion
9070222 this land is ours we claim it as our birthright as our destiny is that wrong who here could find fault with that is it not proclaimed in our histories is it not foretold in the prophecies how are we then to deal with those who would stand in the way of gods mighty will
9070223 you walk in the path of dharma i see this i know this and this knowledge should be in your every heart and mind as well
9070224 is it not right and good that the gods should demand great acts from a people who are destined for greatness
9070225 accept your place in history accept what is given and what is done be at peace
9070226 no indeed this blood belongs to all of us it is the blood of the sacrifice we offer our gods on the threshold of our home it is the blood of our rebirth we shall look upon it with steady eyes we shall not forget
9070227 i can think of no one more qualified to maintain the good reputation of the pasadena unified school district than virginia hoge
9070228 she has an amazing ability to see only the positive and displays unbelievable tenacity in eviscerating anyone who is in the least bit critical of the pusd we need those qualities in our administration and especially in our minister of propaganda i mean assistant superintendent of public communications
9070229 now i finally have the means to let pasadena know how detrimental it is having aaron proctor in our community
9070230 im going to bite off his nuts and spit them down his throat methphorically of course
9070231 i think she just wants to lick my dick and let me do her in the ass
9070232 if somebody talks about classroom progress failures at muir or students being assaulted at phs then this manual will have the appropriate response
9070233 for example if somebody says students are failing you punch their lights out i modeled the manual after a little book i found in my attic that talks about organizing young people to be the power behind a movement were not sure the brown shirts they used in that book will work here in the hot sun but i like the ideas
9070234 our school district is perfect and i will gut anybody who says different
9070235 then i will make art out of their entrails and get edwin and the school board to pay me to make it an art project at don benito
9070236 this is a moment when principles and political independence matter a lot more than just the party line
9070237 every shark of your kind aint your color and every shark of your color aint your kind

9070253 our prime minister said he was going to support working families
9070254 well some of the hardest working families that i know are farming families and the level of assistance they get it pitiful
9070255 i would just appeal to him to show some generosity of spirit cut the red tape get rid of all this bureaucracy and just use some common sense to help these farming families to get through
9070256 to be honest my arse is incredibly hot for some reason and im finding it hard to think of anything else
9070257 the team at ciao has built a passionate consumer community based on intuitive technology and extensive merchant relationships that we believe will deliver incremental benefit to the microsoft live search platform
9070258 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
9070259 all of us at showtime wish david and his family the best during this very private time
9070260 financial incentives attract people to a profession and it is an element but ultimately the financial incentive isnt the main incentive for teachers seeing their student do well its not about that it is the intrinsic value of seeing a job well done mr lampe said
9070261 well hurry up and get there before miss fill in the name of the administrator sees you
9070262 okay well miss fill in the name of the administrator is on the warpath today so get off campus asap so you dont get busted
9070263 can i just please hang out in your room for a minute i really just need somewhere to sit
9070264 no offense but this school is so easy compared to my ct school i dont get it its like the teachers dont expect anything of us
9070265 i think many south australians families children athletes will see mr foleys remarks as arrogant and out of touch
9070266 to describe the commonwealth games as a b grade event is an insult to all of our commonwealth athletes
9070267 they told me i was going to a contending team and that made it a little easier to accept than if i was going to a team that was out of the race that would have been different
9070268 i just listen to my head and my head is very positive i think thats the best attitude you can have just listen to your own mind
9070269 we brought him in to try to use him as a specialist type of player a pass rusher
9070270 we tried to move him around as best we could but when it was all said and done the decision was made for a player that would do more things especially from a standpoint of special teams
9070271 i scored two goals in four games but i want to score four in four games
9070272 i dont want to stop but with carlos up here hopefully he can bang some in too and we can get some wins
9070273 weve been struggling a bit as far as getting results and getting points and we didnt get three but we got one and thats a good starting point for us going forward
9070274 in my two and a half years in this league i think every game ive started jesse has as well
9070275 we have a good relationship its tough when you take out one of the links of the team that has been there since the beginning but it happens to everybody
9070276 i don t think the general public knows that the guys in the barracks are being treated as second rate citizens
9070277 the funds for capodichino come from navy region europe to public works on a quarterly basis and due to the shortfall only emergency services are being provided
9070278 i felt like i had played well enough in camp
9070279 this could be my last year of football im not going to waste it
9070280 at this point i dont know if youll see two quarterbacks
9070281 it is nice to have two quarterbacks with the experience that we have
9070282 a lot of people look from the outside but being there with sean everyday he means a lot to this football team and he should mean a lot to the fans
9070283 when the people hate him and everybody turns their back on him hes still fighting
9070284 the early arrival was a significant causal factor which led to the unfortunate death of mr affifi
9070285 on behalf of the u s government we would like to express our sincere apology and profound sorrow for this tragic accident and extend our deepest sympathy to the family of mr mohamed fouad affifi who died as a result
9070286 we have offered financial assistance to the family of mr
9070287 josh is a guy that weve liked for the last several years when he was in unrestricted free agency
9070288 hes got a good arm we thought he would be a good fit for us
9070289 our players know that and theyve prepared the best that they can prepare well try to play hard and see what happens
9070290 jerrys done a great job in guiding the program certainly theyre in position to play strong against anybody they have a great football team its not specific to any division
9070291 i guess theres a lot of uncertainty but thats just part of the game you just kind of have to focus on doing your job what you can do each day controlling the things you can control and not worry about the things you cant
9070292 we need big play from those guys we need leadership and for them to do the things that they had done all last season
9070293 our expectation is that our offensive line will play well
9070294 were going to have those big guys come up the field at him
9070295 were fortunate to have some athletic ends that we think can run as well
9070296 hes just a tremendous athlete hes just a guy were really going to have to key on
9070297 were really not sleeping on them at all you know with the upset win last year which coach miles mentioned to us a few times
9070298 this is a free market the guards are free to get in and out if they feel cheated but i can assure you more countries are getting involved in this business
9070299 we cannot stick to 1 300 because these people will be returned and will become jobless
9070300 we have accepted this 600 because if all these ugandans working in iraq come back where would we employ them
9070301 the proper marine reaction would be that s not professional get rid of that expletive they don t see it that way
9070302 i could only imagine if our battalion commander caught us with that crap
9070303 we d like to bring sunnis and shiites to play together
9070304 we were trying to find a sport that could unify the whole country
9070305 it s an easy game that anyone can play at a low cost
9070306 there was a concerted commitment by a lot of people to make sure that landstuhl and the europe regional medical command are positioned to take care of not only the causalities but also our moms and dads soldiers and their families and the kids from throughout the european theater
9070307 misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
9070308 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because he doesnt get it
9070309 love of country my friends is another way of saying love of your fellow countryman
9070310 the bottom line was to have a player on your team to just play nickel he would have to be special
9070311 we had to sit there and weigh him against players who could play special teams and do some other things for our team
9070312 we have watched thursdays game and moved on pretty quickly to meetings on roster decisions personnel options and things like that
9070313 it was a short night but we just have to push through it here and figure out our final roster decisions
9070314 but i feel like weve put them in as many situations as we possibly could theyve been exposed from a football standpoint to a lot of different things that could come up in the ballgame and as a coach i think thats your responsibility to prepare them
9070315 when its kicked off out there its a players game and the players have to play to their level
9070316 its a huge responsibility on them to show up on saturday and there is no reason they shouldnt play their hearts out
9070317 the versatility of the offense and what weve been able to do so far the way we can mix up stuff and move people around its really fun to be a part of a system like that
9070318 and the fact that you turn on the tv and joe montana is in the huddle from the 1980s and hes calling the same plays youre calling thats pretty cool
9070319 they cause a ton of sleepless nights and anxiety this ballgame has sort of magnified that because of texas a amp m having a new coaching staff we dont know exactly what theyre going to try to do we dont have a history of what they will do in the college game weve taken a look at a lot of film from coach shermans previous stops
9070320 it said to whom it may concern charles couldnt be at work because his daughter had to have a heart transplant
9070321 by her being on that berlin heart it saved her life
9070322 it bought us more time you can live on a berlin heart over 365 days while we were waiting on a heart
9070323 i tried to not let this overcome me because i knew i had a job to do and i had a season coming up
9070324 im not going to lie it was hard some days i would sit in my room and just think what am i doing here i would feel guilty for being at work and not being at the hospital with my kid i had those days
9070325 as far as camp and football and things like that i told charles if he felt like coming to practice come to practice but take care of his family and go from there
9070326 were just glad that it seems like its going to have a happy ending
9070327 you talk about real men and being a father and husband ive had a chance to see him go through a lot of different things and he just stepped up to the plate
9070328 my wife would get on these blog sites and stuff like that and people were wondering why i wasnt at practice
9070329 someone said i was getting traded for one blog said i hit my wife and one blog said i got arrested for drinking and driving it was a bunch of crazy stuff
9070330 i think probably the toughest thing that i had to battle with and i still battle with it now is that i knew in order for my daughter to live another kid had to die
9070331 the biggest thing that i got out of it is youre taking something negative and making it into a positive instead of having just two negatives
9070332 especially in this economy the way it is this needs to happen much more
9070333 we spend a lot on clothes probably 2 000 a year on clothes and shoes because they turn over so quickly
9070334 they lose them they ruin them the dog chews them
9070335 we save and save and we come here and spend
9070336 its expensive nowadays you can only go so many places without running out of gas and baby stuffs extremely expensive
9070337 i have six children myself this was a huge savior
9070338 franchise businesses can grow rapidly to respond to growing consumer needs
9070339 logic will tell you theres a demand here and theres also potential for growth
9070340 sex wasnt invented in a dark alley behind a porn shop its part of gods design
9070341 the negative calls weve had were basically from people saying this was a subject we shouldnt be dealing with in church that its inappropriate
9070342 its actually just a couple of our guys being silly wearing wet t shirts
9070343 people are tired of that instead of pointing fingers at what our culture is doing we want to be real and talk about who we are in here
9070344 the most important theatrical event of the 21st c debbie does dallas is a modern morality tale told as a comic musical of tragic proportions in the language of the rodeo porn football circus
9070345 last night barack obama was officially nominated democratic candidate for president of the united states and i want to tell you something i really think things are starting to look bad for hillary
9070346 i don t know if you are aware of this or not but this democratic convention they re trying to be environmentally friendly even the confetti that they drop that s actually shredded clinton subpoenas
9070347 and then tonight barack obama speaks to the convention and they moved it to the stadium there in denver they re getting like 75 000 people and i m telling you the construction crew has been working around the clock painting the stadium scrubbing the stadium plastering its the same team that works on nancy pelosi
9070348 last night at the democratic convention bill and hillary clinton were in an elevator when it got stuck between floors for five minutes
9070349 the bad guys are using whatever they can to enhance the email
9070350 the information they use is pretty easy to find online
9070351 from a technology perspective there is nothing new with this spam
9070352 the real difference is that most social engineering is positive while this spam is threatening
9070353 the most unsophisticated chokehold that any judo instructor would completely despise you for ever using
9070354 and this is the kind of choke that people who have no martial skills at all would employ and um and yet it uh uh was completely painless for her
9070355 every human life is sacred and i took her life
9070356 im very sorry for that i dont think ill be able to make up to society for what ive done but ill try to the extent that i can
9070357 and im very sorry for the terrible harm ive caused my children ill try to contribute to society while in prison
9070358 for the time that ive wasted for all the people who worked very hard to convict me of my crime
9070359 in a grave where her children will be able to come and talk to her instead of in the dirt of the oakland hills
9070360 was the right thing to do it brings a lot of closure

9070364 how could the reader of such an article know who wrote what
9070365 an important problem first generation wikis depend on slow and refutable top down decisions
9070366 our ambitious aim with the mememoir project is to revolutionize publishing in all of science with a knowledge base that is open access interdisciplinary and combines the altruistic possibilities of wikis with explicit authorship
9070367 we know there were a lot of u s advisers in georgia but instructors teachers and personnel for military weapons should be on firing ranges and in the teaching centers but where were they they were in the zone of military operations
9070368 and that pushes one to the conclusion that the leadership of the united states knew about the action that was being prepared and moreover probably took part in it
9070369 we noticed the same pattern when we looked at changes in wiki pages virginia governor tim kaine and some of the other potential democratic candidates
9070370 we saw a lot of accuracy and footnote changes on bidens while on kaines page there were a few but not too many also a couple of the same editors were working on both the obama and biden wiki pages
9070371 sometimes youll have personnel at private airports who see activity and discuss it on blogs and forums saying hey i noticed this person leaving in the dead of night
9070372 there was no indication on the putting green when i was warming up that was going to tell me it was going to be like that
9070373 it just felt normal just one of those days where i made about a 15 footer on the first hole another on the second hole i just kind of built on that momentum
9070374 i just tried to keep the pedal down because i knew the scores were pretty low
9070375 its been kind of my goal the last moth or so to get off to better starts in tournaments
9070376 it seems like ive been having to come from behind ive just put it in my to try to get off to a better start obviously this was way exceeding my expectations
9070377 its nuts i dont think theyve got it right quite yet
9070378 how can you have a double major winner not make the tour championship thats complete nonsense

9070386 if we are going to conserve them we need to know more about them where they live what causes the nests to die
9070387 the last few years have been really bad for bumblebees we think its probably the weather but we dont know we need to know how many nests there are we need to find the nests to know how long they live and what destroys them
9070388 bumblebees are very important to the environment as pollinators of crops and flowers but sadly they are struggling to survive in the modern world of habitat loss pesticides and intensive agriculture
9070389 further decline in bumblebees could result in a downward cycle of poorer harvests and sweeping changes to the countryside as wild flowers set less seed and disappear which in turn could have catastrophic effects for other wildlife

9070391 weve seen the end of the very big blockbuster the likes of lipitor
9070392 theres not enough time for a product to become a massive blockbuster theres so much competition in the market
9070393 it takes 550m and 10 12 years to bring a new drug to the patient
9070394 its an investment in public health its only natural that the companies need to make a return on this initial investment
9070395 nice needs to combine pure economic arithmetic with other considerations the severity of the condition the availability of alternative treatments the consequences of refusing treatment in terms of the length and quality of life and the savings in the use of carers
9070396 the idea of early dialogue is now accepted on both sides
9070397 the increased rigour in being able to get a product to market means that far more molecules have to be screened before a likely candidate can be positively identified
9070398 we can expect drug research in large well served areas like pain relief to be reduced
9070399 new drugs for niche conditions are likely to be fantastically expensive in many cases it will seem like blackmail without government assistance or insurance treatment will simply not be affordable for many
9070400 the odds seem lower than in the us but the pressures to enhance drug marketing and co opt the regulators are ever present there is a lot of money at stake
9070401 gsk must change if it is to be successful in the future

9070404 the fundamental principle behind any selection of a running mate would be whether that person is fully prepared to take over and shares your values your principles your philosophy and your priorities
9070405 you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice
9070406 and i dont think that that would necessarily would rule tom ridge out
9070407 john mccain followed her career and admired her tenacity and her many accomplishments
9070408 she was scheduled for a high profile speaking role at our convention and included in the vp selection process because of his admiration for her strong reform credentials
9070409 she gave a slightly different answer and left the door slightly open as opposed to shutting down all the speculation up front
9070410 its hard to see how you can become a smart country without smart teachers
9070411 this project is so unique that it is too early to announce a completion date as any business project it has experienced a number of complications
9070412 in effective business any disputable issues are resolved through negotiations that is why i am certain that the bushehr construction will be completed successfully
9070413 besides it is important for russias reputation as a reliable business partner
9070414 stijn s contract extension is a very important part of the puzzle we re putting together for the next three years

9070419 on friday you may see intermittent unavailability for chat while we restart servers and rapidly push out new releases this will be a brief period hopefully no more than a day or two while we iron out the initial issues
9070420 previously we had to go to berlin london or new york to see things of global importance
9070421 the white cube for example does a very good job for us in london
9070422 but in beijing that didnt exist there was no one to work with but leng lin and his platform beijing commune was too small
9070423 its an interesting opportunity to expand the horizons of our artists and get to know the next generation of collectors in china
9070424 we need to do translations into mandarin develop didactic materials and provide information
9070425 people want to learn to live with contemporary art so its important for us to show art in a residential setting not just a white concrete box
9070426 some galleries are changing the declared value on the artworks brought into china banking on the fact that the person opening the crate wont know the real value
9070427 or they send the work out again and complete the deal in hong kong
9070428 but i feel my timing was right to do this
9070429 would be the reworking of eveningwear jackets specifically by using unpredictable fabrics and details such as military casual or outwear fabrics
9070430 as people continue to sink to lower and lower levels of casualness dressing up has become a point of real distinction a way to stand out among the crowd
9070431 what you see in europe are people who are more comfortable wearing formal wear it might be that our growing attention here to formal wear is being influenced by international travel
9070432 women show up in gowns even if the event doesnt say black tie in hong kong and even now in beijing and shanghai as soon as they have the opportunity to dress up they do in japan a conventional woman will show up in a kimono and she will look amazing
9070433 not only in the standard tux but in alternative evening wear velvet jackets pattern jackets in paisleys and silks a lot of people buy black tie for the opening of the opera and the symphony and theres a multitude of fundraisers thats been great for promoting clothes for special occasions
9070434 especially at work people tend to dress more formally theres more of a sense of trying to impress
9070435 escaping into a film is not like escaping into a book
9070436 books force you to give something back to them to exercise your intelligence and imagination whereas you can watch a film and even enjoy it in a state of mindless passivity
9070437 i cant quite absorb how rapid my disintegration has been
9070438 more often than not my mind eventually drifts away from the story im trying to tell to the things i dont want to think about
9070439 i fail again and again fail more often than i succeed but that doesnt mean i dont give it my best effort
9070440 what interested him about the stories he wrote was not their relation to the world but their relation to other stories
9070441 i know how tough it is for really good writers here its disastrous
9070442 women take care of the real business while their hapless men stumble around making a hash of things
9070443 i think its as good as anything ive ever read
9070444 youve failed to understand that im no longer just a chef im a restaurateur nowadays
9070445 no one knows what its really like in a presidential campaign when the door is closed
9070446 im really interested in writers who arent afraid to tackle very difficult questions
9070447 chris is asking how people can lead us morally and effectively in the world we live in i think thats such a grown up question to ask
9070448 youre constantly made to experience the other point of view i spend my time in rehearsals rooting every characters point of view in some kind of validity from their perspective so the play doesnt side with one or the other and he shinn doesnt provide any easy answers i think he recognises that there are no easy answers to these questions
9070449 hes an intellectual he has real clout and hes very politicised
9070450 but at the same time hes compassionate i think american playwriting is in a really healthy state weve noticed it in the plays we get coming in to the theatre theres a strong generation coming through of intellectual and theatrically bold playwrights
9070451 i care what taps i have in my bathroom im as much part of the machine of consumerism as anyone else yet there is a big part of me that questions the whole way that the system works i think that duality is very common a play like
9070452 i think there are all sorts of concepts that people feel they believe in but that are never really interrogated
9070453 its dangerous not to interrogate your views concepts like multiculturalism what that actually means and where the limits and the problems with it are
9070454 for me nihilism is the enemy its a very easy position to take but all it does is play into the hands of people who dont want anything to change the work that really interests me has moved away from what i would call politics of victimhood towards politics of responsibility
9070455 the first play i directed in the theatre downstairs the royal courts main stage was redundant by leo butler in rehearsal you got so much out of it but as soon as you put it behind that frame of the stage it became the experience of watching from the outside it became like a cultural zoo and i felt very uncomfortable with that theres something about putting a play behind a proscenium that allows the audience to objectify it the minute they do that theyre safe and theyre settled its when they connect that they become active
9070456 you must never allow the audience to feel settled about what theyre going to get next
9070457 more positive vibe as well as lyrical musings on evolution religion transience male friendship and a few other things you wouldnt want to talk about on a first date
9070458 i can understand why people go outside the u s
9070459 you can adopt someone here and the birth parents have three years to come back and get that child thats terrifying american children can use just as much assistance as someone from around the world i want to do something here
9070460 they are hoping to have a little one by christmas
9070461 looking forward to doing a lot of great things i think the best is yet to come in my true humble opinion
9070462 that meant very much to me and seemed to be received so beautifully by the public and the world you know i enjoyed it very much
9070463 have a little cake with my children and probably watch some cartoons
9070464 not only is she the least qualified candidate for national office in decades not only is she virulently anti choice and anti environmentalist shes a pat buchanan supporter
9070465 the palin selection completely undercuts the argument about obamas inexperience and readiness to lead on the theory that because palin is a maverick and a corruption fighter she bolsters mccains claim to be the reformer in this campaign
9070466 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think

9070632 the foreign operators may find 3g spectrum in tranches of 5 mhz to be insufficient for quality 3g services however this is not a concern for the indian operators as they can use 2g spectrum to support 3g operations as well
9070633 this would really help the foreign telecom players to offer quality 3g services
9070634 the acquisition route would not be an easy way out for a foreign player as none of the existing players are keen on offloading their stake moreover acquiring stake in new players does not guarantee 2g spectrum for pan india operations as the dot is yet to provide spectrum across all the 22 circles in the country
9070635 so i have a solution and it will cost not one thin dime
9070636 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured instead the bureau should categorize people according to the likely source of payment should they need care
9070637 i just want to be charged a fair price just like the person next to me probably is
9070638 if texas is a model the crisis in this country is deeper than any of us realize
9070639 this is unacceptable all texans deserve access to quality affordable health care
9070640 we dont need lapdogs we need leaders who are committed to working for texas families
9070641 i just wanted to take the staten island ferry i wasnt expecting the extraordinary rendition
9070642 the 2004 issuance of bonds for the grip transportation program
9070643 advising the new mexico finance authority on 420 million of interest rate swaps in 2004
9070644 the best vacation i ever had was a boat trip on the congo river
9070645 an american once told me that was three years ago in mozambique in a five star beach resort i was on the un payroll i had escaped the peacekeeping mission on rnr while he was on a reconnaissance trip for his multi millionaire clients
9070646 our six planned boat trips on the congo river are fully booked for 2007
9070647 says the belgium of his wealthy eco tourists congos paths have definitely become unbeaten
9070648 just reading the synopsis of your book grabbed at my heart and soul
9070649 the novel conveys a powerful message and im so very thankful that i had the chance to read it
9070650 no congolese has no responsibility into whats going on in congo
9070651 because we the congolese we want peace we are tired of this foreign sponsored war and instability
9070652 people think im making that up but believe me its true
9070653 nobody gave us a chance in fact the bookies stopped taking bets on hull just like with saints this week
9070654 like hull now wed been near the bottom of the league all year and only escaped relegation by one place
9070655 i know its all different now with the players all full time and a lot more interviews and high profile stuff than there was then
9070656 plus its the challenge cup isnt it which has always been the greatest competition in my mind and perhaps thats rubbed off on richard having tasted wembley at an early age all im saying is that there are a lot of similarities between the two finals you never know do you
9070657 as soon as i took over i could see that the cup was our best chance of salvaging something from the season
9070658 weve made a lot of headlines for the wrong reasons this year and been a bit maligned as a club
9070659 but this will be our third major final in the last four years which isnt a bad record ill also be the third different head coach weve had in those four finals so i hope that isnt an omen
9070660 even as a young kid of 14 or 15 you could have a conversation with him about players and tactics
9070661 as a player he was always an intelligent thinking type of footballer and already he had being a coach in his mind he has worked hard to get where he is now hes been out to australia and spent time with melbourne and parramatta and other coaches like englands tony smith just picking their brains and soaking up what other clubs do
9070662 when i go over to theirs its more to see jenny his wife and my grandkids than to talk rugby with richard
9070663 being around him gave me a good start in my knowledge of the game but i dont talk too much rugby with my dad these days only like any two blokes would in a pub over a pint
9070664 ive always been my own man people think you get a leg up when your dad is in the game but you have to work twice as hard
9070665 anyway this weekend hes got enough on his plate organising his trip to wembley and doing all these interviews hes the renaissance man isnt he
9070666 with developers and publishers reluctant to create new content on a system that never breaks npds software top 10 charts sony had to change something and fast
9070667 we might take one calculated risk but we probably wont take two
9070668 a credit to his character and his mental strength many men would have given it up a long time ago with the setbacks hes suffered
9070669 weve listened to feedback from our customers who asked that we provide a specific threshold for data usage and this would help them understand the amount of usage that would qualify as excessive
9070670 250 gb month is an extremely large amount of data much more than a typical residential customer uses on a monthly basis
9070671 he is coming back a better player older wiser and with more experience of top level games what hes got now is the opportunity to play week in week out which wasnt afforded him at his previous club he will benefit and in the end possibly england will benefit because we want him back playing international football on a regular basis
9070672 i always gave it my best whenever i had the chance it was just that i had limited chances i couldnt stop smiling all the way up here and to top it off my kids are happy to be back as well so that makes my day for me
9070673 i feel i will definitely benefit from my time at chelsea it was a tough time but there were a lot of players there for me to learn from im just looking forward to getting out there getting dirty and working hard obviously england is a huge factor in me coming here but my main aim is to get back playing football with city do the best i can and get a run of games
9070674 the offer is impossible to reject and not just because of the money the premier league is a paradise for players and that is why i want to play here juventus also wanted me but i wanted to come to england and to manchester
9070675 in beijing the manchester city scouts watched the argentina matches and decided to do the deal i hope to fulfill all their expectations and im looking forward to playing in the uefa cup its a great competition
9070676 theres a good chance of getting three or four in
9070677 no i wouldnt say there wont be any more outgoings
9070678 i dont think any player is untouchable that is not to say in any way shape or form that we want to see owen leave i certainly would not support that but im afraid a club and a manager not wanting a player to go is sometimes not enough
9070679 we are positioning dell to win in a new era of global it spending
9070680 our growth at a multiple of the industry across all major product categories for the second consecutive quarter affirms we are on track with our five key business priorities notebooks consumer enterprise smb and emerging countries
9070681 as i am starting to get a cold i was not able to think about any faster time
9070682 it was a good track a great crowd my coach told me i should make sure to end the season healthy
9070683 i can have my break do what ever i like go and eat crap
9070684 it will be nice to stay in bed get up after 10 go to a mcdonalds drive through
9070685 that will be pretty tough and i kind of dont think about it too much
9070686 thinking about it would scare me away the way i see it as the years go on you build up experiences and once i get there hopefully i will have enough behind me to keep me in one piece
9070687 we have asked pfrda to frame a scheme that will be applicable for any citizen
9070688 oh well it is nice to be told what to do by one so young and so inexperienced
9070689 he should just keep his head down and try to play good golf
9070690 the only reason we said he had a hotline to nick faldo is that he is the only one saying he had spoken to nick has anyone else said it no right then
9070691 i know this sounds silly to say but it feels a bit like you are playing for your life
9070692 i have hit the ball really well but the greens got me but i have got to keep doing what i have been doing and maybe hit some of the right heel marks out there instead of the wrong ones
9070693 too many fishing rods in the water and you will never catch a fish what with all the bait maintenance join date nov 2005
9070694 i sat through i guess id have to call it a service
9070695 people were responding in unison in the middle leah daughtry a pastor and ceo of the democratic national convention committee spoke and said that despite what the media says democrats are people of faith
9070696 i stood up and said im a democrat but im not a person of faith i said this looks like a church service to me and i never thought i would see the democrats doing something like this
9070697 im not a career protester i just dont like religion mixed with politics its wrong and its dangerous
9070698 we got our occupancy permit were re occupying as promised

9070700 a vertically mounted wire carrying an electric current would rotate continuously round a magnet protruding from a bowl of mercury this phenomenon which faraday called electromagnetic rotation showed that it was possible to produce continuous motion from the interaction of electricity and magnetism
9070701 very quickly after this discovery faraday found how electricity could be generated by passing a magnet in and out of a helix wound with wire these devices were in effect the first transformer and dynamo
9070702 its something to reflect on as far as caring about peoples privacy
9070703 were a natural energy economy and you cant drill on or offshore without bringing the best technology like 3d seismic technology to find areas for drilling directional drilling to exploit it and satellites shes supportive of new tech
9070704 i havent asked for support for the tech industry but she has seen the writing on the wall and alaskas need to diversify its energy supply
9070705 this thing is 1 45 they could easily shave 15 minutes off of this thing without losing much
9070706 this is not a succedaneum for satisfying the nympholepsy of nullifidians rather it is hoped that the haecceity of this enchiridion of arcane and recondite sesquipedalian items will appeal to the oniomania of an eximious gemeinschaft whose legerity and sophrosyne whose sprachgef hl and orexis will find more than fugacious fulfillment among its felicific pages

9070725 we help startups and tech companies learn how to build healthy communities
9070726 were kind of like personal trainers for companies that want to get better at social media
9070727 if we do the hard work for our clients then we build the muscles and when our contract is up the company is no better off and we leave with a bunch of social capital that our client should have been earning
9070728 i mean simply we sell our advice and our experience being in the trenches building grassroots communities working on open source projects being transparent giving away our work and our knowledge as much as we can towards building healthy global sustainable movements like coworking and barcamp
9070729 and through this work ive had the privilege to know and to meet people who are really pursuing their passions or just beginning to learn that thats an okay thing to do and i think if anything a good measure of how successful we are with our work is the degree to which through our advocacy and our own actions we are able to convince other people to give themselves the permission to pursue their own passions and the things that make them most happy its a hard thing to quantify but at the end of the day i can say that its a rather satisfying way to make a living
9070730 the phrase human is undefined and vague and on that basis defendant denies the allegation

9070734 integrating ciaos capabilities into live search will provide a strong launch pad for our commercial search offer in europe and enhance our e commerce offering on msn
9070735 search is currently a list of rulings but we want to provide users with information such as a list of airlines with the best fares or when users type in a restaurant name we want to give them a map to the venue
9070736 in this case we will look at the users search history such as if they have just been looking at chinese restaurants we will have an idea of what the user wants to find

9070741 with all due respect to gov kaine hes been a governor for three years
9070742 kaine was mayor of the 105th largest city in america and again with all due respect to richmond virginia its smaller than chula vista california aurora colorado mesa or gilbert arizona north las vegas or henderson nevada its not a big town
9070743 its something to reflect on as far as caring about peoples privacy
9070744 were a natural energy economy and you cant drill on or offshore without bringing the best technology like 3d seismic technology to find areas for drilling directional drilling to exploit it and satellites shes supportive of new tech

9070749 wonnen we de eerste wedstrijd met 3 0 in breda van nac maar daarna verloren we twee thuiswedstrijden achter elkaar
9070750 curb the excessive roaming charges consumers had to pay for roaming calls
9070751 the eu roaming regulation was introduced so that europeans could exercise freedom of speech with their mobile phones without fear of excessive bills when traveling in the single market
9070752 as a result over 400 million consumers across europe have benefited from significant savings of around 60 percent when making and receiving calls during travel holiday or business
9070753 in the first quarter of 2008 a customer using data services paid on average 2 05 euros per megabyte while roaming with companies from their operators group and 5 40 euros per megabyte for roaming with non group companies
9070754 italian and slovak consumers who roam with a non group company can even pay over 12 euros per megabyte
9070755 for 30 years i have witnessed congress dangling a carrot in front of amtraks eyes funding it just enough for it to limp along and ill tell you this has to stop now is the time to commit politically and financially to a strong safe and efficient passenger rail system
9070756 of course there was give and take otherwise it wouldnt have taken this long both guys are going to bask in the result because this is going to be in my opinion the biggest fight of all time from a revenue standpoint
9070757 it was a huge fight but it was more or less an american fight this is a global event because pacquiao is the asian standard bearer and de la hoya of mexican descent from the united states people all over the world are going to be talking about this fight and thats what makes it as big as it is
9070758 ronnie i would put into evidence one tape that i would hope that you would watch that was oscars fight with pernell whittaker remember this was oscar at the peak of his career and whittaker who was fading and if whittaker hadnt give up the last round for whatever reason i dont know he would have won the fight
9070759 oscar de la hoya always has difficulty fighting speed and always has difficulty fighting a southpaw manny pacquiao has both of those qualities in abundance so freddie roach really believes and knows what he was talking about when he said that he likes his guys chances in the fight
9070760 thats the speed that kills you and oscar doesnt handle southpaws
9070761 the smartest people in the world are those who set up betting lines and those big punters who bet on the fights they are not talking from the standpoint of any kind of sentiment or emotion this fight opened up at 8 to 5 thats less than 2 to 1 there hasnt been a big fight all year where odds have been so close
9070762 creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes art is knowing which ones to keep
9070763 stored the body in the bathroom then moved it to his car where it stayed for two days while he searched for a place to bury her
9070764 googles a great company got some great products but you know in some respects i think google is where microsoft was 7 or 10 years ago
9070765 microsoft has over 40 full time people invested in privacy and over 400 part time people google hasnt at least from what i read about them evolved to that
9070766 we think about privacy as part of the core design we have thought about how to design privacy into the product as opposed to how to react to the negative impressions
9070767 so these are all images that anyone could go out and take with a camera we do take great care that if someone did feel their privacy was invaded there is a way that they can easily tell us about it and well remove it right away
9070768 the thing is any time you get a provider in the market that has a predominantly large share of that market questions start to get asked about their practices about what their motives are
9070769 i desperately hope that they in fact i expect that they will change they will become as grown up as some of the larger companies around so in some respects its a predictable thing
9070770 those problems are specific to the us theres no way they could come here
9070771 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
9070772 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered

9070776 i just hope people enjoy the book and put it on their coffeetables

9070778 he hargreaves trained on the night before the game with the rest of the team but when he came to us in the morning he said he was still feeling his knee
9070779 he felt that he wasnt fit enough to play and after that theres nothing more you can do if the player decides himself you have to accept it
9070780 we would like to have played him and got him back into things because he hasnt had enough football in the last year
9070781 we need to get him back and we are disappointed hes been training with the first team for 10 days and as i say theres nothing more we can do we gave him the right preparation his training programmes were at the right tempo the right speed of training everything was done in the right manner to get him back for this game so thats the disappointment
9070782 the sending off was unfortunate but the fact he had already been booked meant he had to go
9070783 could not wait to get them in at the break
9070784 i cant deny that zenit deserved to win we played better when we were 2 0 down and we created quite a few chances to score but i have to say that zenit shaded it
9070785 the way we played tonight was superb and we definitely deserved the victory
9070786 in fact i am surprised we did not score more goals
9070787 dont believe everything you read theres a lot of rumour and speculation out there about kindle

9070854 moses said thus saith the lord about midnight will i go out into the midst of egypt and it came to pass that at midnight the lord smote all the firstborn in the land of egypt from the firstborn of pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon and all the firstborn of cattle
9070855 and samson lay till midnight and arose at midnight and took the doors of the gate of the city and the two posts and went away with them bar and all and put them upon his shoulders and carried them up to the top of a hill that is before hebron
9070856 and it came to pass at midnight that the man was afraid and turned himself and behold a woman lay at his feet
9070857 and she arose at midnight and took my son from beside me while thine handmaid slept and laid it in her bosom and laid her dead child in my bosom
9070858 and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him
9070859 watch ye therefore for ye know not when the master of the house cometh at even or at midnight or at the cock crowing or in the morning
9070860 and he said unto them which of you shall have a friend and shall go unto him at midnight and say unto him friend lend me three loaves
9070861 and at midnight paul and silas prayed and sang praises unto god and the prisoners heard them
9070862 and upon the first day of the week when the disciples came together to break bread paul preached unto them ready to depart on the morrow and continued his speech until midnight
9070863 but when the fourteenth night was come as we were driven up and down in adria about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country
9070864 arise shine your light has come arise from the oppression and oppression that has held you down rise to new life
9070865 lord what happened i had good intentions when i started the day but then somehow i lost sight of your purpose
9070866 i started off good but distractions sent me in so many directions that i do not know if i accomplished anything today
9070867 that their goal of shattering the political glass ceiling didnt have to die with hillary clintons departure from the race besides
9070868 if you havent seen vanna in a pantsuit you havent lived
9070869 its true i dont have the type of experience that john mccain has or joe biden for that matter but im very well rounded as you can see and diplomacy begins with a d im pretty sure which is a letter ive turned a lot
9070870 and you know what she can pronounce the word nuclear properly which is more than you can say for sarah palin and the current occupant of the white house
9070871 we know there were a lot of u s advisers in georgia but instructors teachers and personnel for military weapons should be on firing ranges and in the teaching centres but where were they they were in the zone of military operations
9070872 and that pushes one to the conclusion that the leadership of the united states knew about the action that was being prepared and moreover probably took part in it
9070873 if the leadership of the united states had sanctioned that then i have the suspicion that it was done specially to organize a small victorious war
9070874 and if it didnt work then to create from russia the appearance of an enemy and on that ground unite the electorate around one presidential candidate of course the ruling party
9070875 in a significant way the crisis was provoked including by our american friends in the course of the election struggle
9070876 this was the use of administrative resources in a deplorable way to provide advantage to one of the candidates in the current case from the ruling party
9070877 if european states want to serve the foreign policy interests of the usa then in my opinion they will gain nothing from this
9070878 a country in the current case russia which can stand up for the honour and dignity of its citizens defend their lives will not be isolated despite the bloc like thinking of our partners in europe or in the united states
9070879 the world doesnt end with europe or the united states
9070880 but i think any kind of reaction they would take to the eu would be in kind like visa restrictions or a business contacts freeze
9070881 i dont think the retaliation would include the kind of things like restricting oil
9070882 they are occupiers here they are occupiers all around georgia
9070883 the churchs general secretary the reverend tuikilakila waqairatu calls the charter an illegal and dangerous document but in a news release the national council says it is disappointed by the churchs decision it says many people are amused by the new moralistic tone of the church leadership given its support for previous coups the council says the reverend waqairatu has not shown how the charter will cause division and it asks how peaceful ethnic relations can be fostered or future coups stopped without the help of the police or military it says the members of the methodist church should not be misled by claims the charter will be imposed on people but that the people will decide the council says this is in direct contrast with the actions of the church leadership which forces its minority views on the people
9070884 we dont have an extra vessel we would have to make a contingency plan should something come up but again the engineers are working very hard to maintain the equipment
9070885 we are very excited to acquire the rights of andrej meszaros this evening
9070886 andrej is a perfect fit within our plan to rebuild the lightning into a contender he has a strong all around game he competes he moves the puck and he can handle big strong forwards defensively perhaps most importantly were pleased to add a 22 year old player with almost 250 nhl games already under his belt we know andrej will continue to grow and improve as he matures with the rest of our defense

9070900 reason for the collapse of world trade center 7 is
9070901 they issued long awaited results of their findings as to the cause of collapse of world trade center 7 the third building destroyed on 9 11 nearly
9070902 i wish that there would be a peer review of this
9070903 i think all the records that nist has assembled should be archived i would really like to see someone else take a look at what theyve done both structurally and from a fire point of view i think the official conclusion that nist arrived at is questionable
9070904 photos of the steel evidence about how the buildings collapsed the unexplainable collapse of wtc 7 evidence of thermite in the debris as well as several other red flags are quite troubling indications of well planned and controlled demolition
9070905 why would all 47 stories of wtc 7 fall straight down to the ground in about seven seconds it was not struck by any aircraft or engulfed in any fire an independent investigation is justified for all three collapses including the surviving steel samples and the composition of the dust
9070906 wtc 7 building could not have collapsed as a result of internal fire and external debris no plane hit this building this is the only case of a steel frame building collapsing through fire in the world the fire on this building was small amp localized therefore what is the cause
9070907 the reason for the collapse of world trade center 7 is no longer a mystery it did not collapse from explosives or fuel oil fires
9070908 the specifics of the fires in wtc 7 and how they caused the building to collapse remain unknown at this time although the total diesel fuel on the premises contained massive potential energy only a low probability of occurrence
9070909 sunder proceeded to stumble through some convoluted explanation for why only fire could be responsible seeming caught off guard and uncomfortable
9070910 we built in enough redundancy to allow entire portions of floors to be removed without affecting the buildings structural integrity
9070911 i have over 35 years of fire research in my experience i worked in the fire program at nist for 19 years leaving as a division chief i have been at the university of maryland since i am a founding member and past chair of the international association for fire safety science the principal world forum for fire research
9070912 in my opinion the wtc investigation by nist falls short of expectations by not definitively finding cause by not sufficiently linking recommendations of specificity to cause
9070913 dr quintiere made his plea during his presentation questions on the wtc investigations at the 2007 world fire safety conference
9070914 i think the official conclusion that nist arrived at is questionable
9070915 i hope to convince you to perhaps become conspiracy theorists but in a proper way he said
9070916 she stands up for whats right and she doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down
9070917 i didnt get into government to do the safe and easy things a ship in harbor is safe but thats not why the ship is built
9070918 at first they had me in a bunch of furs
9070919 yeah i have furs on my wall but i dont wear furs i had to show them my bunny boots and my north face clothing
9070920 a woman of faith who has a strong position on life a consistent opinion on judges
9070921 id rather go moose hunting than be involved with politics
9070922 sarah palin for her entire political career has been underestimated
9070923 shes tough shes tenacious i believe that she does have what it takes to get out there again her ability to connect with voters and make a case is very very very strong
9070924 happiness is excitement that has found a settling down place but there is always a little corner that keeps flapping around
9070925 yeah i cut the yard worked the garden fixed the drain and now im gonna sit back and see what weve got
9070926 i know theres tremendous expectations here for what you would like to accomplish with this football program i can tell you that however you feel about it i have even higher expectations for what we want to accomplish i want to win every game we play
9070927 son that was alabama right there and bear would have been proud the way that team played all year
9070928 the ultimate objective of all these conspiracy theories is a territorial break up and dismemberment of the country
9070929 i dont trust anybody more than i trust him when it comes to stuff like that just to go down there and hear it from him its something i needed to do just to clear my mind
9070930 he said my ligament looked fine thats what i was afraid of it was a big relief
9070931 i dont like to see anybody get hurt but thank you josh
9070932 to me hes one of the best pitchers if hes not the best pitcher in the game this guy is a big time big game pitcher
9070933 theyre going to miss him id rather face anybody else than face him hes one if the best ive ever seen
9070934 there were a number of tests and josh came through with flying colors
9070935 obviously we hoped for that we needed to get some closure
9070936 im going to take our campaign to every part of our country and our message of reform to every voter of every background in every political party or no party at all
9070937 politics isnt just a game of competing interests and clashing parties
9070938 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9070939 governor palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government
9070940 by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done senator mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9070941 we should all be proud of gov sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and sen mccain while their policies would take america in the wrong direction gov palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9070942 he sees sarah governor palin as the future of the party
9070943 these are people hed like to elevate in that regard reformers
9070944 id like to know more about her experience if something happened to him would she be qualified to step into the presidency
9070945 ive stopped wasteful spending cut taxes and put the people first
9070946 i would be honoured to serve next to the next president of the united states
9070947 i know it will demand the best that i have to give and i promise nothing less
9070948 as a mother of one of those troops john mccain is the kind of man i want as our commander in chief
9070949 we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9070950 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9070951 governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9070952 had not been briefed and prepared for some of the questions
9070953 this is the biggest political gamble i have ever seen she is enormously exciting but if god forbid something happens can she be president
9070954 shes got the grit integrity good sense and fierce devotion to the common good that is exactly what we need in washington today
9070955 shes exactly who i need shes exactly who this country needs
9070956 at least at the start this is going to be a very very tight election campaign
9070957 we did make the case pretty strongly that these dates should be avoided
9070958 but in a multicultural country where we are fortunate to have many different religions and many different cultural celebrations its sometimes difficult to avoid that in every instance
9070959 he absolutely wants to go to an election thats my conclusion
9070960 i think harpers figured it out its a game of inches its a battle for minorities now
9070961 the reality is that if the conservatives are that far behind in ontario and quebec its going to be a struggle
9070962 theres another 11 points of survey respondents supporting other parties or undecideds who are willing to say im going to look at this guy
9070963 the war within a secret white house history 2006 2008
9070964 shes exactly who this country needs to help me fight the same old washington politics of me first and country second
9070965 shes got the grit integrity good sense and fierce devotion to the common good that is exactly what we need in washington today
9070966 there was no indication on the putting green when i was warming up that was going to tell me it was going to be like that
9070967 it just felt normal just one of those days where i made about a 15 footer on the first hole another on the second hole i just kind of built on that momentum
9070968 i just tried to keep the pedal down because i knew the scores were pretty low
9070969 its been kind of my goal the last month or so to get off to better starts in tournaments
9070970 it seems like ive been having to come from behind ive just put it in my to try to get off to a better start obviously this was way exceeding my expectations
9070971 we cant just say if somebody masturbates 12 times a day thats wrong
9070972 if they take care of other things in their life if theyre physically and physiologically ok otherwise we cant really say that
9070973 sex addiction is a specious condition it does not exist
9070974 it has a moralistic quality to it and a quality of lack of responsibility
9070975 you cant just stop this cold turkey its really hard
9070976 my goal when i see people is to try and get them to progress as quickly as possible so i can move on and help other people
9070977 people who are having lots of great sex with people that they love and feel close to arent considered sex addicts and they dont need therapy
9070978 we are the music makers and we are the dreamers of dreams

9070989 our compliments for your blog we like it a lot
9070990 smeared prime minister harpers reputation with the brush of proven bribery scandals that are completely unrelated to this case
9070991 the goal that is achieved in the new rules is to fully protect investors without unduly burdening foreign private issuers

9071006 i was expecting five sets i was there for four and five but he wasnt there anymore
9071007 he is the biggest player for sure nadal is playing good tennis this year but for me federer is the best one
9071008 i dont think its affected a whole lot of matches i dont know how many times its saved a match because thats what its there for really but at the big tournaments at the big courts usually you have the best linespeople as well
9071009 the worst linespeople are usually on the outside courts where you need it more thats the problem with the system
9071010 as long as im doing the splits that means im healthy
9071011 when im not doing the splits you know theres something wrong
9071012 im not too sure about my body if i go into a split who knows if ill come back up
9071013 i wish i didnt have any drama in my matches i wish i would win nice and in a simple way
9071014 who likes drama do you know anybody that likes to get involved into tight matches
9071015 most of our inquiries are asking for explanations because its so different
9071016 to save lives protect property and public health and safety or to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe
9071017 youre going to see a lot of people who are extremely skeptical it would seem that you would need a little more time
9071018 a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
9071019 any replays of the 2005 storm season could see gasoline prices soar to 5 per gallon
9071020 until this hurricane hits the trend has to be higher toward the 120 level
9071021 if this turns out to be a nonevent the market could really come roaring back down
9071022 it seems there will be at the very least a slight hit to production
9071023 but everything is up in the air until monday or tuesday
9071024 u s oil demand is currently 1 6 million barrels a day lower than when katrina struck
9071025 there is today more u s refining capacity offline for economic reasons than can be destroyed by gustav
9071026 we are negotiating with both and theyre going at the same speed
9071027 whoever wants to come after me must deny himself take up his cross and follow me because whoever wishes to save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it
9071028 whoever believes in me even if he dies will live
9071029 it is no longer i who lives christ lives in me

9071033 the county presented a proposal that provides for a restructure of the existing bond debt at lower fixed interest rates over a longer term
9071034 creditors received the proposal and agreed to respond next week
9071035 its very positive if the county comes up with a solid plan and prevents bankruptcy
9071036 all of the debt issuers in the state will suffer with higher yields if jefferson county has to file for bankruptcy
9071037 the tone of the meeting was positive and constructive and i remain willing to facilitate further progress towards a solution
9071038 will probably be moving the market one way or the other
9071039 if it fizzles then it will be a big relief on oil prices
9071040 if you look at gdp youre led to believe the economy is solid
9071041 but if you look at the variables employment industrial production and personal income the economy does not look solid but weak

9071114 lets not kick the can down the alley and let someone else be responsible for it
9071115 this is why i say its fiscally irresponsible to take money from local government or to borrow money from transportation in order to close that hole that we have that 15 billion deficit
9071116 we dont want to see any borrowing done to balance this budget
9071117 those games have been played for far far too long in sacramento its time for the legislature to collective deal with the problem they have at hand and not borrow from the future not borrow from our children and not borrow from our grandchildren
9071118 we urge the legislature to make responsible budget decisions now and balance the budget now without borrowing from local government and transportation funds
9071119 it is time for politicians up there to stop putting the people through a budget roller coaster ride every time the economy goes down

9071167 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy
9071168 so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy

9071175 i stood up ran outside and noticed that my patient had driven through the at amp t store
9071176 then i saw her inside with her car and holding her hands up like i dont know what i did

9071182 i am saddened to learn of the death of gladys powers who may have been the worlds last surviving female service veteran from the first world war
9071183 over 80 000 women served in our armed forces in that war although they may not have realised it at the time these early women volunteers did much to break down the barriers for all those service women who have come after them and who continue to serve their country so proficiently and professionally

9071187 i would question why boys are not included in this vaccination programme as it is after all a sexually transmitted disease males can be considered the vehicle for the transmission of these viruses with the population
9071188 it is not known yet how long the vaccine will protect even with the use of booster jabs protection may wane after ten years or so these women will be vulnerable to infection later
9071189 by not vaccinating boys we are potentially leaving a pool of infected individuals who could spread the viruses

9071192 were using these silent fireworks for the first time in a major display this is the most important display we do in this country so its a good chance to showcase new material
9071193 if theres a quiet passage of music it seems a bit pointless to shoot lots of noisy fireworks up in the sky so we will have these very soft fireworks lighting up the sky when the violins come in
9071194 the music is very bubbly with lots of stops and starts were trying to use the fireworks to highlight the individual notes
9071195 its a very precise question of timing it might take two to six seconds for a shell to burst in the sky so we have to work out exactly when to set it off
9071196 the bank of scotland fireworks concert is a spectacular way to celebrate the end of the festival season

9071200 it is legitimate for the people of pakistan to ask whether that story is true or not and what is his response because so far neither the government of pakistan nor mr zardari has responded
9071201 i would humbly request that he should withdraw his candidature in the supreme national interest in the interest of democratic stability and also in the interest of the future prospects of his party
9071202 mr zardari is the pakistan peoples partys unanimous choice and he accepted our request to take the nomination
9071203 i am a long time supporter of palestinian rights as i suspect were many in the queens hall this morning however the effect was totally counterproductive
9071204 absolutely disgraceful even if one might have sympathy with the palestinian cause this was not the platform the audience had come to hear an uncontroversial programme of brahms smetana and haydn not the views of political activists
9071205 i was moved by the commitment to their artistry in performing their entire programme and in doing so they were rewarded with a rare but very well deserved standing ovation
9071206 aberdeen city council has one absolutely clear priority to achieve the budget savings which are needed to put this local authority back on an even keel elected members council officers and our external advisers are all working to that end
9071207 very productive meetings have been held with the external support group who can see that we have a clear plan of action for how we will make the necessary financial savings we really appreciate the help they have been able to give us and their adv
9071208 the leadership board is also working as a team with its entire focus on moving forward to achieve financial stability we are really pleased as is the external support group on the progress we have made so far
9071209 a huge amount of work has been done in the last few weeks
9071210 some of the specific savings are more challenging than others and once we have the work fully scoped may only be fully realised in 2009 10
9071211 contingency arrangements will be relied upon if needed in the immediate year our budget managers clearly understand that the savings have to be made and are working extremely hard to deliver them
9071212 there may come a time when we have to look back and address the issues of how we got to this position but that time is not now our collective effort must be to look ahead and move the council forward in a positive direction

9071278 portions of mghss student government may well be curriculum related but every student group placed as a subgroup of the student government does not automatically qualify as curriculum related
9071279 the eighth circuit has twice affirmed judge ericksens opinions both opinions were comprehensive and right in line with the law
9071280 it provides little or no substantive guidance to how to classify student groups
9071281 untenable position of either closing their forum or running the very real risk that youll be subjected to multiple litigation with no guidance from the courts
9071282 its almost impossible to remember all the side effects of medications you know because there are so many medications out there
9071283 having a program that displays all the side effects is very useful

9071288 the general consensus amongst industry professionals is that a new generation of home consoles will arrive on the market in 2011 or 2012
9071289 is the fact that they dont have a significantly larger storage medium than the previous systems its a slightly bigger dvd disc if were filling up the disc right now where are we going its not like our games are going to get any smaller
9071290 in terms of specific things blu ray hasnt made much difference the original game fits on a 360 disk so it wasnt like we were in need of room
9071291 its not inconceivable that you might have a next gen xbox with a relatively simple cpu
9071292 just a couple of biggish out of order cores and then some larrabee like monster handling graphics physics ai and so on
9071293 as its philosophically similar to larrabee the problem is that the only workload on a console that is currently parallelised is graphics and thats the one thing the cell doesnt do real time physics and complex ai will become more important on consoles as will more programmable graphics ray tracing is one example so highly parallel and programmable larrabee or cell chips look like the way forward
9071294 pretty much no chance of making money on the ps3
9071295 were looking at the last generation of consoles theres not going to be an xbox 720 or a ps4 ill make that bet not going to happen

9071301 the real way to judge these conventions is not a weekend but over the next two or three years and to see how many visitors come back see how many companies come back and book conventions see if a company for example is having a better time recruiting people who hadnt heard about us
9071302 so um the webpage or whatever is just something you do for fun do you have a real job
9071303 well that is our job we dont technically get money for
9071304 the top of her left toe was amputated in the accident she was taken to perth royal infirmary but re attachment was not deemed viable

9071306 she is a very keen dancer at the time she was attending dance classes five times a week she was regularly competing in dance competitions
9071307 she was allowed to return to some dancing following her discharge in october 2005 she was unable to undertake point work for ballet for a period of six months
9071308 the toe remains tender while undertaking such work the toe remained sensitive to pressure and hot water for three months after the accident

9071313 hes not eating very much and hes in a lot of discomfort but hes a big strong cat hes lively noisy and in your face
9071314 hes not allowed to stand up or walk around yet because hes got pins in his leg but the vet says hell be able to get around again in about four weeks
9071315 i think it is just a coincidence the chances of a cat finding the vets house are just about zero
9071316 energy conservation is by far the best use of money
9071317 the question is why we are not doing more of this
9071318 assumption that as long as its got a renewable tag on it we can carrying on using energy at the level we have been
9071319 im not at all surprised to find a company trying to build new coal fired power stations using unfounded assumptions about the renewables industry
9071320 essentially what they are doing is taking a very simplistic analysis and arguing that we need to massively back up for the worst possible scenarios
9071321 its not surprising given their agenda is all about building massive coal fired power stations
9071322 under the current trading system for power you just wouldnt build it so clearly there has to be some sort of encouragement
9071323 the funding for the fringe is just pitiful when you consider its the worlds biggest arts festival its shocking that it receives so little compared to the edinburgh international festival when you consider the benefits it brings
9071324 although the fringe does not programme any shows it could do a huge amount with reasonable public funding particularly in terms of rearing new talent there should be year round work going on with school drama and music departments
9071325 the fringe should be looking to recruit some of the best people in the country to take charge of the box office sponsorship and development work to do that it needs significant additional funding
9071326 we need to look at the whole role of the head of the fringe in the context of the wider review that will be going on however we do need a leader someone who can be an inspiration and motivator and a strategist to look at the fringes place in the city in the uk as a whole and its context in the world
9071327 the fringe is the biggest arts festival in the world and i do believe we should be looking to attract a real world class individual
9071328 the title of a director is a bit of a misnomer and suggests that the role is more creative than it actually is we should be looking to create a role of chief executive and look at the kind of salary the position would attract
9071329 the amount of funding the fringe attracts is risible at the moment having a proper chief executive is a fantastic idea and would help the fringe take a much more proactive role
9071330 i dont think there is any need to panic at the moment
9071331 the fringe has enjoyed great success over the years and there have been a number of factors to consider this year we are content to wait to see the results of the various reviews
9071332 let me spell out exactly what change would mean if i am president
9071333 for over two decades mr mccain has subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else
9071334 what it really means is that youre on your own out of work tough luck youre on your own no healthcare the market will fix it youre on your own
9071335 what has been lost these past eight years cant just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits
9071336 what has also been lost is our sense of common purpose
9071337 individual responsibility and mutual responsibility thats the essence of americas promise
9071338 the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 per cent of the time
9071339 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 per cent chance on change
9071340 you cant truly stand up for georgia when youve strained our oldest alliances
9071341 if he makes it to the white house hell have an enormous mess to clean up if it doesnt go as smoothly as wed like to see then critics will say i told you so
9071342 im sorry weve had to increase our prices and weve made this decision extremely reluctantly especially as household budgets are being squeezed so much
9071343 there is help available for people who cant afford to pay their bills and we want our customers to get in touch if theyre worried
9071344 these are difficult times and we understand the financial impact this announcement will have on our customers
9071345 although were one of the last companies to announce increases were sorry we couldnt hold on any longer however we have worked very hard to protect people for as long as possible from these considerable increases in the wholesale market
9071346 we have tried hard to keep electricity prices as low as possible and our increase of 9 per cent is the lowest in the sector
9071347 the continuing volatility in the global market for gas is directly contributing to increasing the uks domestic energy prices and scottishpower is not immune to these rises
9071348 the industry wide shift to higher household energy prices is now complete all the major suppliers have increased prices for a second time this year this is a heavy blow and few households will emerge unscathed or unconcerned about the future affordability of their energy
9071349 there is strong expectation that the government will shortly announce a raft of measures to protect the most vulnerable action is long overdue token gestures will achieve little
9071350 let me spell out exactly what change would mean if i am president
9071351 for over two decades mr mccain has subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else
9071352 what it really means is that youre on your own out of work tough luck youre on your own no healthcare the market will fix it youre on your own
9071353 what has been lost these past eight years cant just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits
9071354 what has also been lost is our sense of common purpose
9071355 individual responsibility and mutual responsibility thats the essence of americas promise
9071356 the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 per cent of the time
9071357 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 per cent chance on change
9071358 you cant truly stand up for georgia when youve strained our oldest alliances
9071359 if he makes it to the white house hell have an enormous mess to clean up if it doesnt go as smoothly as wed like to see then critics will say i told you so
9071360 there have been dramatic changes in the housing market since march theres no doubt the value of the land at meadowbank has plummeted and were nowhere near putting it on the market at present
9071361 everyone knows theres been a downturn we are having to take stock of everything
9071362 the downturn in the housing market has reduced the number of housing developers prepared to buy theres less cash available and less of an appetite to fund such purchases the council will have difficulty finding a buyer under the terms it might have expected last year
9071363 at least this week it has been busier than anywhere in iraq busier than johannesburg
9071364 ive been in theatre six weeks and in that time weve dealt with around 500 casualties
9071365 which ever way you look at it thats substantial everything has shot up since july
9071366 they are rather hard to skin but whats inside is very nice to eat its like a slightly firmer textured chicken and less strongly flavoured than rabbit
9071367 theres no issue with it affecting us in any way
9071368 its popular there to the extent that they have pretty strong controls on hunting of grey squirrels they have a completely different view of the grey squirrel to the tree rat view we have here
9071369 its not like a rabbit where it slips off like a sock you really have to use the blade and pull the skin back
9071370 the vast majority of people arent really into eating what they kill
9071371 the majority of people wouldnt wring a chickens neck for a sunday roast
9071372 i am sure that many people will feel that this is a pretty sick and opportunist idea
9071373 i started work as a red squirrel conservation officer and had heard a lot of people asking us about eating grey squirrel meat
9071374 once the grey squirrels have been killed its good to be able to do something with the bodies
9071375 so i decided to try it i was given a ready dressed grey squirrel by a friend and portioned it up into the rear haunches and saddle
9071376 then i gently casseroled it with a few bits of vegetable and spices
9071377 i didnt put too much flavour into it so that i could properly taste the meat
9071378 i cooked it for about an hour and quite a few people had a taste of it so it just didnt go very far really you need one squirrel per person
9071379 i dont think its like chicken as a lot of people would say its just like any other sort of meat really
9071380 it has quite a gamey flavour its a bit richer than rabbit and it was quite tender because it had been softened by being put in a casserole
9071381 theres very little fat on it so its very healthy and its very tasty as well
9071382 ive eaten it again since that first time i tried it which was about a year or so ago
9071383 i think it could take off and i think lots of restaurants will soon start trying it
9071384 its seen as a bit quirky its also sustainable and a lot of people understand the reasons why we are advocating control they are saying we might as well use the by products since we are killing them
9071385 i think it might take a bit of time to really catch on in the cities but in the countryside its just considered to be another sort of game
9071386 they started dropping the bombs at seven oclock in the evening of the 11th
9071387 they were black planes the cattle ran all over the place some of the cattle were killed
9071388 we are trying to make as many passengers as possible aware of their options in terms of alternative flights and the possibility of securing refunds for the flights they booked
9071389 this failure in a tough economic climate along with numerous other airline failures this year highlights the importance of having financial protection in place when you book flights
9071390 the airlines thought it would add another unnecessary cost but it would be a useful levy and should be rolled out to all pre arranged air travel
9071391 we have been pushing the government for a long time to introduce a compensation scheme for all passengers of scheduled airlines across the board
9071392 there is much at stake for the sps because if we win this case it would allow any victims family to claim compensation if they were harmed by a prisoner who was released negligently
9071393 their solicitors are saying there is no legal duty of care to the public
9071394 im sure this will come as a surprise to many members of the public
9071395 if for instance they were to release a psychopath by mistake and he murdered a whole crowd of schoolchildren they would not be responsible
9071396 having regard to campbells record it was reasonably foreseeable that he would be involved in further violent offending on his release
9071397 his violent behaviour which was predictable was the cause of catherine thomsons death the reasonable precaution whereby the death may have been avoided would have been to carry out an assessment regarding risk to the community and to put in place measures to minimise the potential risk
9071398 if no such measures were possible then campbell should not have been released
9071399 there is no question that over the past five years there has been huge pressure to send more and more people into open prisons
9071400 there is a duty to keep the public safe the service has a duty to take all reasonable steps to make sure risk to the public is minimised
9071401 the prison numbers have gone up and the staff numbers have gone down which means no one is doing their job properly the staff are rushing around and so risk assessments are not nailed down
9071402 the scottish prison service was to blame for catherines death and they should be brought to account for that
9071403 nothing will bring catherine back but we need to take a stand because it may prevent another tragedy from happening to someone else
9071404 a small number of the necessary preparations for the event could not be completed in time
9071405 it comes as absolutely no surprise that members of the calman commission have had to cancel their trip to stirling because of lack of interest
9071406 not content with excluding the option of independence from their discussions the unionist parties have been determined to exclude the people from talks on their countrys future the commission has been nothing more than a group of politicians talking to each other behind closed doors
9071407 an enormous humiliation for the commission and added that the contrast with the
9071408 it has captured the imagination of people the length and breadth of scotland with more than 425 000 hits on the scottish government website while hundreds of members of the public packed out town halls to hear cabinet ministers at the recent events held around the country
9071409 the commission has a serious task ahead of it in exploring the experience of scottish devolution and it is determined to make sure its engagement programme and work is as effective as possible
9071410 how could this happen in europes oil capital a city full of millionaires
9071411 we had to keep it relatively simple and 40 40 20 roughly reflected the populations
9071412 the snp go on about how scotlands oil wealth should be for scotland but what about aberdeens oil wealth for aberdeen
9071413 there are far greater social problems there with deprivation poverty and unemployment than in glasgow and funding needs to reflect need
9071414 the fact is that we have always had the same funding level but managed to make the books balance and it suggests that something went very badly wrong when the liberal democrats took over
9071415 how they can push through a project like that when the city is facing a financial crisis is staggering
9071416 it should be cancelled and a different less expensive option considered
9071417 the fact is that our capital projects are spend to save projects if we stayed in st nicholas house we would have to spend the same money for something that may just last a decade if we are lucky
9071418 in the meantime we would have to find temporary accommodation for staff at further expense
9071419 the council taxpayers are now picking up the bill for those short term decisions
9071420 this is just a smokescreen to hide their own incompetence
9071421 it meant there was no direction or strategy and a lot of replication its probably cost the city millions
9071422 for years the squeeze has been put on councils and they have taken expedient measures such as cutting maintenance budgets
9071423 but now is there nothing more to squeeze and we have infrastructures that desperately need repair and replacing added to that we have a convergence of single status pay costs landfill pensions and many other things and councils are going to find it hard to cope
9071424 aberdeen was the least able to cope with all these factors for the simple reason that it is the worst funded that is why it was first to get into trouble this way
9071425 it is clear that in aberdeen there were particular circumstances coming from the fact that it was spending 10 million a year beyond its means

9071439 we have not been aggressive enough in the east metro area
9071440 theres a regional system thats going to develop here very quickly
9071441 we just have to make sure we dont let political considerations trump long term planning
9071442 id argue that no project is more important to washington county than to have that central corridor completed
9071443 i know hillary clinton i voted for hillary clinton governor youre no hillary clinton

9071453 its not real common but theres been a number of these cases i think it happens all over the state atvs are fairly common guys use them to go to liquor establishments
9071454 they dont have driving privileges to operate a motor vehicle
9071455 about the only thing youd be safe in these days that has a motor is a segway
9071456 yes i know but this way you can just give me a dollar bill back

9071461 maintaining and strengthening the international reputation of malpeque oysters is a major priority
9071462 while i am confident that we continue to market a high quality product i take very seriously any concerns that are expressed which question the quality of that product
9071463 it is vitally important that we continue to meet the demands of the marketplace in a positive and responsible manner
9071464 there is growing competition in the marketplace and we must ensure that we continue to maintain and strengthen the quality of our product
9071465 as a role model and olympic hero to americas children michael phelps and all athletes and celebrities are asked to reconsider any connection to substances suspected as agents of obesity including sugary cereals soft drinks and other foods with refined carbohydrates saturated fats trans fats and high fructose corn syrup
9071466 as we set out to look at the causes of obesity in our film killer at large we found that one of the most prevalent contributors to childhood obesity is the overwhelming amount of advertising directed at our nations youth that confuses unhealthy food with messages of wellness michael phelps endorsement will undoubtedly influence more children to nag their parents for products that endanger their health so that they can go home consume these products and gain weight instead of becoming gold medalists this is unconscionable and we hope that michael phelps reconsiders his endorsement contracts
9071467 public figures like michael phelps exert a major influence over our youngsters ciof believes that celebrities should think twice before choosing to endorse or encourage the consumption of any product which is inherently unhealthful sic to children especially if that product is correlated to obesity diabetes and a myriad of dangerous conditions
9071468 michael embodies the values behind our frosted flakes earn your stripes programme
9071469 as an official sponsor of the 2008 us olympic team and a proud sponsor of phelps it is only fitting that kellogg company feature this world class athlete on its iconic boxes of kelloggs corn flakes and kelloggs frosted flakes cereals
9071470 sports agent peter carlisle is making a strategic branding mistake by aligning michael phelps to kelloggs frosted flakes and mcdonalds in this era of escalating child obesity and diabetes the last association michael phelps wants is that of junk food pusher
9071471 while michael phelps may consume thousands of calories a day and burn them off through olympic training americas kids arent so fat sickly and have little hope of accomplishing a single sit up much less olympic gold kids are watching and michael phelps going for the quick cash of pushing junk food at the expense of children tarnishes his image similar to an association with cigarettes or alcohol would national action against obesity and the childrens international obesity foundation implore michael phelps and all celebrities and athletes to reject offers to push more sugar fat and hazardous calories onto americas kids

9071489 the respondents have no interest that justify an indefinite detention of dr al arian
9071490 continued detention serves no governmental purpose other than those of a punitive nature
9071491 i suppose i am a bit concerned about getting addicted
9071492 it is only addiction if it makes you not be able to do something like heroin first youre fine then you take it and you cant do things that is addiction but you you have a serious sleep disorder and you take these and you can sleep so it lets you do things it is not addiction
9071493 because no report was made to authorities the response was slowed and people put at risk

9071496 if we had a building and there was a cornerstone it would read the shield march 2002
9071497 thats really when fx as we know it began and frankly i think thats when basic cable began as you now know it in terms of scripted original programming
9071498 i think the face of basic cable was changed for ever
9071499 it made a lot of people think why cant we i think a lot of people made a lot of phone calls and tried to find out what we were doing and the formula behind that
9071500 networks that are more adult skewed and willing to take more chances were emboldened
9071501 not only did the shield show the way but it showed that you can do it and the government wouldnt close down your network and advertisers while they might have initial qualms would eventually come around to support a show like that
9071502 i think the usa stuff some of the tnt stuff is tougher than it would have been
9071503 fx couldnt have dreamt of an emmy before that show
9071504 year one it was sex and violence and year two with emmys and glowing reviews it became romance and action
9071505 we were able to turn that around and really started to show a business model that said basically cable can in fact invest that amount of money in original programming and its good business for everyone
9071506 average cash flow margin was below the industry average in 2002 and jumped above it in 2003 and beyond
9071507 certainly theres nothing unsupportable financially about the cost of the show
9071508 its arguably still cheaper since we know its a successful show than two birds in the bush
9071509 the cost of physically producing it has mushroomed hardly at all
9071510 networks are so cognizant of the fact that its very very difficult to find develop and launch a great hit show that generally speaking they make the decision that theyre going to keep those shows on the air indefinitely and they just live in denial eventually the show is going to lose its steam and its quality and theyre gong to have to cancel it
9071511 it also has an interior narrative structure thats best served by a limited number of seasons
9071512 and therefore lets plan for it lets do it intentionally
9071513 there is a dynamic tension between business guys saying you have three hit shows rest on your laurels
9071514 my attitude has always been the minute you start resting on your laurels is the minute youre forced to keep these shows on the air past their creative shelf life you end up diminishing the quality of the shows and then you end up scrambling to replace your hits after theyre gone
9071515 i said i think the question will make sense to you after youve seen the show
9071516 and i said obviously we think were going to be able to deliver eyeballs with this show obviously for us to continue doing original programming were going to need our advertiser partners
9071517 i do believe the advertisers saw the benefit in figuring out how to support high quality original programming in basic cable
9071518 our originals are what drive this network our movies are great and everyone loves them but give me the originals
9071519 i think that those so called problems were always overblown by a special interest group that had an agenda to trumpet its successes and is frankly dishonest in the way it portrays its point of view and its successes
9071520 of course as that occurred it was often erroneously and i think intentionally erroneously reported as advertisers pulling out of the shows
9071521 i feel like we really finished it in an incredibly strong way
9071522 especially the last seven episodes it becomes like a moving freight train and it becomes quite explosive in the final episodes
9071523 it feels like a movie were waiting for that release
9071524 i am skeptical that were going to see a lot of new viewers
9071525 over time you have a lot of viewers who for whatever reason fall by the wayside
9071526 now that they know its the end they may come back to check it out but im not expecting that ratings this season will be significantly higher than the one that just aired
9071527 in a heartbeat if we had the right part for him
9071528 the guy is to us what johnny carson was to nbc he helped us build this network
9071529 our biggest concern was not is it too far out there
9071530 i had no reason to believe that anyone outside of hbo would make a script like that
9071531 the basic idea of your central character killing another cop at the end of the pilot you didnt see tv shows like that on the major networks
9071532 i had no idea who peter liguori or kevin reilley were
9071533 i had no idea why theyd be interested in my script i spent a lot of time talking to kevin and it became clear that i had stumbled into the zone that they were trying to hit
9071534 i think if we start from a place of hey lets break down barriers the audience can sniff that out and things can seem a little gratuitous
9071535 we just tried to tell the best story we could week to week and we did it without having the usual network filter on how we told those stories or how admirable we had to make our characters the result was something that a lot of people found groundbreaking
9071536 like any great alignment of the stars its hard to imagine now that anybody else could have played it
9071537 but in fact we were struggling casting the role michaels name came up early on his agents wanted us to offer it to him i wasnt going to do it because i knew michael chiklis as a fantastic actor but a very different kind of guy than we had in mind
9071538 it was one of the great moments in my show business career
9071539 when liguori and i walked upstairs to the casting room chiklis was sitting there chewing nicorette gum in a leather jacket with the shaved head
9071540 there was no chit chat there was no small talk he launched right into the scene like vic mackey he was vic mackey he literally knocked us on our asses and then blew out of the door with that same sort of magnetic energy that he brought to the role
9071541 there were other more lucrative options out there and the important thing is that in these fragile careers you have a guy who said this is the right role for the right moment in time for me and im not going to just chase the money
9071542 people were telling me that i was insane and id never work again if i did it
9071543 had the show not worked for whatever reason i would have definitely taken a big hit in terms of taking that kind of risk but thank god i did i had to go with the material and the people involved
9071544 that was my biggest thing am i going to show up on day one on the set and the pink pages are going to come down and this is going to be boiled into its least common denominator because ill quit

9071582 meramente rep e a infla o em n veis muito modestos inclusive
9071583 todo aumento de servidores precisa ser pensando com cuidado porque tem que ser pensado em rela o sociedade
9071584 os outros servidores o que est o recebendo como est o recebendo est o tendo aumento apenas acho que preciso ter cuidado al m do efeito cascata essas coisas precisam ser muito bem explicadas no congresso porque quem nos paga a sociedade
9071585 ela a sociedade tem o direito de saber a quem paga quanto paga porque paga e para que paga
9071586 tendo sido candidato a presidente duas vezes 1998 e 2002 em condi es hostis estaria falseando a verdade se eu disse que descarto ser candidato agora s n o serei candidato por mim mesmo
9071587 se a ela falta a primeira experi ncia eleitoral nela sobram intelig ncia e generosidade
9071588 o que vai estar em jogo em 2010 uma colis o em rela o a uma concep o neoliberal que por exemplo destruiu a ind stria naval do brasil e a nossa concep o que recuperou a ind stria naval brasileira se for eu sou eu se for a dilma a dilma o que n s n o podemos deixar dar para tr s

9071596 i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaida and the taliban in afghanistan i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb russian aggression

9071600 the department of law advised me that this bill is unconstitutional given the recent court order mandating same sex benefits
9071601 with that in mind signing this bill would be in direct violation of my oath of office
9071602 the governors veto does not signal any change or modification to her disagreement with the action and order by the alaska supreme court it is the governors intention to work with the legislature and to give the people of alaska an opportunity to express their wishes and intentions whether these benefits should continue
9071603 we may disagree with the rationale behind the ruling but our responsibility is to proceed forward with the law and follow the constitution i disagree with the recent court decision because i feel as though alaskans spoke on this issue with its overwhelming support for a constitutional amendment in 1998 which defined marriage as between a man and woman but the supreme court has spoken and the state will abide
9071604 i believe that honoring the family structure is that important
9071605 eso lo ha hecho diferente con m s cuerpo y una personalidad bien definida

9071608 probably the toughest thing that i had to battle with and i still battle with it now is i knew in order for my daughter to live another kid had to die
9071609 i struggled with it and struggle with it and the biggest thing that i got out of it was youre taking something negative and turning it into a positive instead of just having two negatives
9071610 what we tried to do as the bears organization for charles was just let him know we were there for him whatever we could do to help we would do it and as far as camp and football and things like that i told charles if he felt like coming to practice come to practice but take care of his family and go from there
9071611 i think the purpose of this press conference is really not to tell my story but just to let people know about organ donation get that awareness out to everyone
9071612 well that sucks because i would have to pick and choose my friends and people would be insulted
9071613 well that sucks because i would have to pick and choose my friends and people would be insulted
9071614 i was pretty sure i was safe its definitely frustrating it changes the outcome of the game
9071615 it changes the momentum instead of being down 3 2 they get out of the inning soriano comes up and hits a home run now theyre up 3 2
9071616 i dont really want to get into that stuff as far as taking instant replay to every aspect of the game
9071617 were playing good because we feel very confident at home and everybody is healthy
9071618 as long as you get it right i dont want to get into the replay thing
9071619 the guy called him out and the ump wasnt going to change it
9071620 i didnt really feel him hit the bag i just wanted to go over there and get the ball and you know guccione called him out so hes out
9071621 the ball kicked away from me i was able to get it
9071622 a bang bang play and i dont know i didnt see a replay yet but i heard it was pretty close
9071623 the city realizes that contractors have backlogs of work and these clubs have tried in good faith to get their design state approval and construction moving along

9071634 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
9071635 you dont defeat a terrorist network that operates in 80 countries by occupying iraq
9071636 john mccain likes to say that hell follow osama bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
9071637 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have

9071653 were excited about being able to deliver expansion packs in a more modular way than traditionally now players can pick and choose what features they want rather than paying a higher price for a larger expansion pack which may have features they arent interested in
9071654 you come out of a game like this you feel fortunate
9071655 its are we laying a foundation thats the only thing ive said it from day one
9071656 solid most of the second halves some of the guys wont ever be here so its hard to say but what it does maybe it reflects what were trying to teach we played our base stuff thats all we did the whole camp just trying to get guys in a groove it really doesnt mean any more than that
9071657 the meaning of that is to build on something everything were working on it shows up on tape all our hustle running to the ball being in your gaps we practice to win and thats what we did so we build a foundation in the preseason
9071658 i just wanted to document the security and the excitement around this candidacy
9071659 the secret service agent in the driveway told us we could take pictures but we had to take pictures from the other side of the street
9071660 you cant park on either side of the street anymore or down the street or down obamas street
9071661 we will make every effort to ensure that any adjustments in security effecting area residents will be as unobtrusive as possible
9071662 were a lot more secure than we were six months ago
9071663 to me its been a lot quieter around here you dont see as much kids hanging out on corners

9071665 can you get a lab result this isnt rocket science
9071666 the physician market is a relatively difficult one in the u s
9071667 whereas theres great opportunity in it for physicians there isnt much current indication that the market is going to move
9071668 the health care it market is like the 80s cold war
9071669 but instead of nuclear weapon stockpiles and star wars mumbo jumbo its about providers arming with technology to defend against payers and payers arming with tools to ward off rising costs
9071670 even some of these systems that hospitals are putting in while theyre not green screens any more theyre still pretty archaic
9071671 if we were talking 10 years ago wed probably be saying the same things
9071672 but today there are more drivers the technologys better youve got younger physicians coming in older physicians going out and you have reimbursement changes that are driving payments around quality as opposed to volume of patients
9071673 i was never really in danger so it was actually pretty good for me
9071674 i knew the longer the match would go the more tired he would get
9071675 i was struggling to see the ball at the net a little bit with the crowd in the back
9071676 in the second set when it got tough he dug out some shots and everything seemed to go against me
9071677 when federer slips a little bit he reaches the finals of the grand slams every time
9071678 he is the biggest player for sure nadal is playing good tennis this year but for me federer is the best one

9071687 those who give up liberty for security deserve neither and will lose both
9071688 its important for our fellow citizens to understand when you think patriot act constitutional guarantees are in place when it comes to doing what is necessary to protect our homeland because we value the constitution
9071689 the power of the executive to cast a man into prison without formulating any charge known to the law and particularly to deny him the judgment of his peers is in the highest degree odious and is the foundation of all totalitarian government whether nazi or communist
9071690 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile it is morally treasonable to the american public
9071691 we have roughly 10 of our volunteers in gaza and we have to get them
9071692 we need to get the passengers together hopefully within a month
9071693 this might be the beginning of a simple delivery service if we can set up the mechanisms here in cyprus this can be used as a model for what can be made more permanent
9071694 i hope to get an artificial leg so i can have a chance at walking again
9071695 i dont have a real life in gaza its full of death and chaos
9071696 coming to the knicks and hopefully being able to contribute means a lot to me

9071713 after undergoing some medical tests at mumbais lilavati hospital the dalai lama is stated to being in a stable condition and there is absolutely no cause for concern over his health
9071714 but i can also tell you this right now people keep talking about the investment we have in him thats not the issue the issue is that we think hes a heck of a pitcher who has struggled this year but has a chance to be a heck of a pitcher again
9071715 the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner its agent or the law

9071717 during the investigation police also uncovered alleged links with a number of armed robberies at bowling clubs in the sydney area

9071722 realmente estou saindo de cora o partido porque amo este clube pedi para que o s o paulo me liberasse porque estou num momento da carreira que preciso garantir um futuro melhor

9071728 i know if i had left my expensive cell phone somewhere i would want someone to pick it up and call me

9071730 she was raped and brutally attacked she has very significant wounds around her mouth and scratch marks on her face
9071731 she is in shock she is suffering but she is also very courageous
9071732 it is likely he has already left perhaps for england or for another french port or perhaps he has headed to belgium or the netherlands
9071733 many of the people who come from africa afghanistan iraq are very very desperate and this woman was apparently trying to document some of that desperation and had been to the camp thats known as the jungle several times before
9071734 we took the position we did some time ago because we thought he was an important witness
9071735 hes always been able of course to come here and testify and get out of jail by doing that
9071736 to save lives protect property and public health and safety or to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe in the states the white house said
9071737 many pensioners already worrying about whether they can afford to heat their homes this winter will be outraged by news of yet more colossal price hikes
9071738 it is a huge worry that one in three pensioner households are likely to be living in fuel poverty by the end of 2008 and many are already feeling forced to cut back on essential food or fuel
9071739 all the major suppliers have increased prices for a second time this year this is a heavy blow and few households will emerge unscathed or unconcerned about the future affordability of their energy
9071740 these are difficult times and we understand the financial impact this announcement will have on our customers although were one of the last companies to announce increases were sorry we couldnt hold on any longer however we have worked very hard to protect people for as long as possible from these considerable increases in the wholesale market
9071741 extremely reluctantly especially as household budgets are being squeezed so much
9071742 thats more than britain china india and pakistan and probably more than france
9071743 unlike many countries including the united states the israeli state does not belong even in principle to those who reside within its borders but is defined as the state of the jewish people wherever they may be
9071744 israel is midway through a drive to establish a space program much of it devoted to military purposes

9071748 theyre conservatives going to be excited about this pick because heres an authentic person who believes and does what she says in her policy atmosphere and can authentically carry that message to the country
9071749 on his 72nd birthday is this really the one heartbeat away he wants to put in the white house what does this say about his judgment
9071750 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president look at what shes done to this state what would she do to the nation
9071751 sarah palins chief qualification for being elected governor was that she was not frank murkowski she was not elected because she was a conservative she was not elected because of her grasp of issues or because of her track record
9071752 when i first heard the choice i was pretty skeptical
9071753 its a desperate hail mary pass thats going to fall flat
9071754 shes going to energize conservatives and shake up the status quo which is exactly what this election is about it sends exactly the right message
9071755 obviously when the pick is unknown it depends how they perform on the first day i thought she did great

9071777 if we have a katrina type event youre talking about gas prices going up another 30 percent

9071830 its been a year of ups and downs and drama

9071836 its difficult to pass on any road course really but here its not like you drop a wheel off in the gravel and keep going or get pushed wide you hit a wall
9071837 theres just nowhere to go i did a couple of them last year but they werent pretty a lot of crashes end up happening when you try the only other spot you can make up spots outside of actually passing would be through strategy through fuel saving through pit stops i think a lot of us tend to rely on strategy for the cleanest passing
9071838 i dont go back and think if i should have stopped or not
9071839 i love to play this game and ill play however

9071855 there have been a couple of races where its like either me or him and i think that brings out the best in a lot of people
9071856 for us its been a lot of fun like i said if it comes down to just him and i for the championship that would be fine but i have a feeling some of these other guys are gonna have something to say about that
9071857 besides that they have a little better race cars than us at sometimes then no not really
9071858 yeah theyve caught up to us the past few weeks but we finished second its hard to put that into trying to become any better

9071860 i even joke around with guys with myself that carl is bff carl were best friends i dont believe its a rivalry i believe that we can still be friends and stuff like that and have that relationship on the racetrack
9071861 when ive won hes congratulated me and thats why all this stuff this week i kind of just got a chuckle out of it because i know deep down that what he says doesnt matter to me and what i say doesnt really matter to him what really matters is we race well on the racetrack so id say that well be fine
9071862 i dont think it means that if you get into another driver and spin him out then youre going to get suspended for a race
9071863 i think it has to do with the way that you got put on probation which is if you do the same thing that you did again then the repercussions for it are going to go up and that would probably be a suspension or something like that it means keep your post race antics down to a minimum
9071864 i just have to be a little extra careful not to let my emotions get the best of me
9071865 i did what i felt was best at the time and thats fine
9071866 the only bad part about it is just tearing up race cars when you dont need to
9071867 i couldve very easily drove off into turn three and doored him right in the left side quarter panel or something and spun him out
9071868 i didnt do that i tried to race him clean i tried to get back by him and i got bogged down a little bit by denny hamlin who got along side of me and we raced for a little bit
9071869 i will not plead in line with my standpoint towards this court
9071870 i have stopped using a false name i think all parties should do the same
9071871 this court is representing itself falsely as a court of the international community whereas it is in fact a court of nato whose aim is to liquidate me

9072005 it is minimally necessary that such tests be done in brazil by appropriate research institutions on the vaccines distributed in brazil
9072006 by special interest groups to propagate false information with the objective to divert attention from the campaign rumors can begin with anonymous messages that question the safety of the vaccines used or the justifications for the campaigns
9072007 the role of the who in population control efforts has been documented for more than 20 years
9072008 and since the 1970s the who has supported research for the invention of sterilizing or micro abortive agents to work stealthily in conventional vaccines
9072009 yet when caught and exposed in its dirty works who blatantly denies as if it did not know anything about population control and as if it were the most pro life group in the world innocently concerned only about unborn babies and their health
9072010 un forat amb ferros que a m s no es poden tocar fins que no ho autoritzi un jutge
9072011 union families are really charged up and ready to move in a different direction a direction that will really rebuild the middle class in this country
9072012 the issue really is that there is an unfamiliarity with barack obama hes fairly new on the scene and there are a lot of union voters white working class voters as you say who are not yet familiar with him mccain is not talking about economic issues barack obama is talking about economic issues but this is about economic issues this is about the direction of this country for working families this is about rebuilding the middle class
9072013 weve got over two million homes going into foreclosure weve got millions of people having their cars repossessed we havent see a condition like this since the depression
9072014 weve gotta tellem the truth about john mccain and we have to tell them whats going on with barack obama and how hes going to make their life better
9072015 he believes that the country is going in the right direction he believes that the bush policies were good policies
9072016 theres a thousand reasons to be with barack obama and theres one reason to be against him and it is time for all us to unite get behind obama and make a change in washington d c barack obamas african american get over it lets move on together he is our candidate
9072017 eight hundred thousand more people living in poverty in 2007 than in 2006 the increase is 500 000 in children and 200 000 in seniors thats just morally wrong
9072018 she was not rumored to be on the short list
9072019 the last mention of her i remember was back in june
9072020 with a chip like the atom it is only now possible to put a pc like device in a car
9072021 as interesting and adventurous as what you have on your ipod
9072022 the hipster is and always has been a demographic for consumption and symptomatic of modern capitalism we must not get confused between the images we are sold and real active sites of cultural resistance
9072023 they sat there a while breathing deeply beside them a small cricket began to chirp and chirp and after some time it was no longer light that came spilling down the hill but shadows
9072024 what can we call this fit but a meaningful experience of generative melancholy of that strange feeling that sadness connects us to lifes vibrant pulses
9072025 it is fantastic to see such a great response to our annual visitor guide
9072026 the team at ciao has built a passionate consumer community based on intuitive technology and extensive merchant relationships that we believe will deliver incremental benefit to the microsoft live search platform
9072027 the loss of these flights 200 000 passengers 20 million euros 16 million in tourism revenue and 200 jobs could have been avoided if cork airport had agreed to continue the current low cost agreement on these routes
9072028 we wanted a show where the music was relevant to the culture at large and not just within the confines of the musical theater
9072029 my immediate thought was spring awakening it was 1999 everyone was having millennial thoughts and i thought a great way to look forward would be by looking back this story just struck my heart
9072030 a straight shot of eroticism has steamed open under the innocuous name of spring awakening and broadway may never be the same
9072031 he dared to tell the truth at a time when that kind of truth telling just wasnt done were in a similar place in our society now where there are a lot of heads buried in the sand
9072032 the bitch of living the musicals creators pay tribute to the spirit of the original
9072033 wedekind was about adolescent angst the way adolescents now deal with their angst is they listen to indie rock and emo so what better way of channeling the angst of 1891 german kids than to send them into this kind of alternate reality where they become rock stars in their bedrooms
9072034 we were trying to make sure that what we did had integrity
9072035 and was progressive and was true to the spirit of frank wedekind but was yes trying to bring a new audience to the theater
9072036 i love the fact that the brackets of musical theater are being expanded
9072037 and should more accurately be called hormonal awakening i am of the older generation its not for me
9072038 the experience of becoming an adult and moving out of childhood transcends time and place
9072039 this is when you start to define yourself and the world starts to define you the changes you are experiencing physically emotionally socially and in every other way are so extreme that inevitably things are triggered you start to become the person you are

9072046 in europe they ran out of options for me we had to look for a new place new opportunities
9072047 when i moved here not only did i not know anyone i couldnt speak english
9072048 you can reach your dreams i figure i was given an opportunity other people dont usually get
9072049 its a little different from high school but its not as scary as they told me it was going to be
9072050 i guess thats what an american dream is working so hard for something you really really want and what i want is to become a doctor one day
9072051 shes inexperienced shes unethical and shes wrong on every womens issue
9072052 an innovative and engaging way for people to share their lives leverage their community and get the most out of their online experience
9072053 it will become a feature inside other services for example its possible that youll log into yahoo mail and see your profile along with all of your friends profiles in your contact list
9072054 exactly what i need exactly who this country needs to help me fight the same old washington politics
9072055 shes got the grit the integrity good sense and fierce devotion to the common good that is exactly what we need in washington today she knows where she comes from and she knows who she works for she stands up for whats right and she doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down
9072056 i never really set out to be involved in public affairs much less to run for this office
9072057 with fellow reformers in the great state of alaska as governor ive stood up to the old politics as usual to the special interests to the lobbyists the big oil companies and the good ol boy network
9072058 its always safer in politics to avoid risk to just go along with the status quo but i didnt get into government to do the safe and easy things a ship in harbor is safe but thats not why the ship is built
9072059 politics isnt just a game of competing interests and clashing parties the people of america expect us to seek public office and to serve for the right reasons and the right reason is to challenge the status quo and to serve the common good no one expects us to agree on everything whether in juneau or in washington but we are expected to govern with integrity and good will and clear convictions and servants hearts
9072060 it is fitting that this trust has been given to me 88 years almost to the day after the women of america first gained the right to vote
9072061 the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9072062 for my part the mission is clear the next 67 days im going to take our campaign to every part of our country and our message of reform to every voter of every background in every political party or no party at all if you want change in washington if you hope for a better america then were asking for your vote on the 4th of november
9072063 if you came in the office in a short skirt and boots you could have whatever you want
9072064 i have five posters on my bed five wanna know where the fifth is
9072065 you can get a clean unused 9mm automatic for 1 500 a glock for a couple of grand and you can even make an order for a couple of mac 10s
9072066 or you can get a little sawn off for 150 theyre easy enough to get hold of youll find one in any poverty area every estate in london and its even easier in manchester where there are areas where the police dont go
9072067 people who use shotguns tend to be lower down the pecking order there is less use of sawn off or full length shotguns and if a criminal wants street cred he wants a self loading pistol a mac 10 or an uzi submachine gun
9072068 there has been an influx from eastern europe and particularly from poland and there are also a lot coming in from people who have served in afghanistan and iraq
9072069 in liverpool docks you can put in an order for 10 guns and some grenades and theyll say ok and two weeks later they will be there and they are straight goers
9072070 they are legally sold in germany and wont fire a bullet but they can be converted by removing the partially blocked barrel and replacing it with a rifled barrel
9072071 after other small alterations it can then fire 9mm bulleted ammunition the replacement barrel is longer than the original and is threaded so that it will accept a silencer which is commonly sold as part of the package
9072072 there are hundreds of these floating around and hundreds have been seized
9072073 they look the part as they are based on the russian military makarov pistol if you are a 20 year old drug dealer and you want a gun that is what you will get and it will cost about 1 000 to 1 500
9072074 about two years ago a supplier brought back hundreds of german made revolvers blank firing pistols which can be bought legally in germany they were then converted and new cylinders made they could then be sold for 700 to 800 when the supplier would have bought them for 60 and spent about 30 on converting them
9072075 someone will have a tool and there is always one guy in a posse willing to use it they will have one guy who doesnt give a fuck
9072076 everyone wants to be a gangster now mainly the kids you have five or six in a little crew and one of them will be carrying they want handguns shotguns are too big and bulky the sawn off doesnt look so good but use a machine gun and you get known as a heavy guy they have them just to be a chap on the street to pose some of them walk around all day with a 38 its 16 year olds at it and its getting like america silly as it sounds
9072077 whos using the guns the jamaican yardies value for life was so minimal that they thought nothing of killing people
9072078 we dont like them they have no moral code but its the russians and the polish and albanians around now they are bullies they want to take over the flesh business the russians are cold hearted fuckers what they have been doing is following the card boys who put cards advertising prostitutes in phone booths in central london and then taking the girls hostage armed if need be
9072079 and drug dealers are taking a policy decision to get youngsters to carry guns
9072080 you can hire a gun for a period and if the gun has already been used for a murder the going rate comes down
9072081 you can go to the former soviet union or countries with less stringent regulations than ours and although british customs have their successes many guns appear to be smuggled into the uk
9072082 all you get handed in are guns from boys who wanted to be gangsters and then got a job or someone whose mother found it in their bedroom if i had a gun i wouldnt take part because if i got pulled what would i say oh im just on my way to the amnesty also if it gets out that youve given in your tool people will think youre a wrong un
9072083 only silly people keep it in their homes normally you have a keeper a couple of miles away and some of them have been at it for 20 years its best to have an old fellow with no previous or a woman you keep the ammunition separate because youll get a much heavier sentence if you have them together
9072084 i went to the cemetery and said well boy i can put you to rest
9072085 i shed tears every day and i probably will till the day i die why do these people have to kill for nothing if they want to kill people why dont they join the army you dont ever think a shooting will happen in your life its all down to guns just guns
9072086 a gun used to be used as a mediator now everything is revolved with a gun its brought the heat on everyone before you would get a two years jail sentence now its a five its getting like the us now like the wire its like a prediction of what will happen here i think they all think theyre playing grand theft auto its madness out there
9072087 social media is very introvert friendly because many introverts are more comfortable writing their thoughts feelings than they are speaking them
9072088 as an extreme introvert i enjoy social media as it gives me social content but in a measured way
9072089 there is no point being the treasurer of nsw if people arent prepared to make the difficult decisions around public sector reform
9072090 i will not be treasurer if the mini budget in november does not return the states credit rating to a sustainable path
9072091 im viewing this as if ive got a contract with the taxpayers of nsw
9072092 cosy up with a loved one for a break on the yorkshire moors as immortalised by brontes wuthering heights
9072093 an identification tag inscribed with private fishers details has been found at the site
9072094 this is an extraordinary discovery that together with the small quantity of bones recovered in the dig strongly suggests we have located the grave of private fisher and we wait with some confidence for formal identification by australian and vietnamese forensic specialists
9072095 mccain has made a brilliant move here we do have a woman on the ticket but she is a republican woman its not hillary clinton sarah palin does not have to wear pantsuits and her husband is not a crook
9072096 governor sarah palin is an outspoken advocate for pro family policies that energize social conservatives
9072097 she has a record of advancing the culture of life at every opportunity including championing a ban on partial birth abortion and promoting parental consent for minor abortions
9072098 by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done senator mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9072099 while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9072100 i am really pleased to see that the mccain campaign has reached out to a woman
9072101 yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics
9072102 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the supreme courts abortion rights ruling the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies
9072103 a cynical effort to appeal to disappointed hillary clinton voters and get them to vote ultimately against their own self interest
9072104 governor palin may be the second woman vice presidential candidate on a major party ticket but she is not the right woman sadly she is a woman who opposes womens rights just like john mccain
9072105 temperatures should be a few degrees cooler today than yesterday throughout the region but it wont be very noticeable
9072106 notably cooler tomorrow with temperatures as much as 20 to 30 degrees cooler
9072107 having somebodys dream and life being washed away is hard to comprehend we were just happy to help out in any way
9072108 i like the help i receive here the people i met are really wonderful this is great it gives me an uplift that makes my disaster bearable
9072109 everybody wants me to come back to where i was but i have a hard time with this in life i like to move on
9072110 at best copy protection does nothing good for legitimate users and only annoys software pirates at worst it makes it difficult to install software onto a hard disk and to make backup copies that are vital if the original is lost or destroyed it slows the performance of some programs and causes snarls in others it can be a pain for networks of pcs hooked together to share data and peripherals and worst of all there have been reports that some killer protection schemes have destroyed hard disk files inadvertently or otherwise software makers who have abandoned copy protection this year seem to be avoiding bankruptcy and they have certainly gained goodwill when the goodwill comes from big corporate buyers including the federal government which has refused to buy copy protected software it is likely that the losses from pirated software can be offset
9072111 the online music industry has evolved so that while there are open file format standards notably mp3 the major companies have so far preferred proprietary or licensed file formats protected by drm systems
9072112 he started to force himself on me and i couldnt stop him
9072113 i understand but at the same time i was under mental distress
9072114 if they just investigated and said maybe this did happen even if inconsistencies in story this wouldnt have happened if they investigated case instead of dropping it

9072129 the new problem of cyber bullying has become something of an epidemic
9072130 it requires therefore all of us at the level of being parents at the level of community leadership at the level of political leadership to work together against a problem which now knows no geographic frontiers

9072157 as is too often the case in humanitarian affairs actual performance is less central than demonstrating compassion
9072158 she really came into the preseason and has looked great from day one it started for her last spring in track and and then she was able to have a great 10k at the mac mid american conference meet and it has just built from there for her
9072159 his goal today was to win and im really happy he was able to do that last year as a freshman chris came in here without doing any summer training and we gave him a hard time for that because of how gifted a runner he is but this summer he put in a lot of work in the off season work and for him to break 16 minutes today was a great effort on his part
9072160 we were certainly not happy to get beat by the margin we did in the mens race but overall the guys made a great effort
9072161 i didnt see anyone giving up despite the intervals and no one looked like they were quitting the slow start hurt us but that is the danger of an early season meet we wanted to be cautious but probably got too cautious and with a 5k race you just wont be able to make up that ground
9072162 i thought the womens team ran very well tonight and we had great efforts from them across the board
9072163 we especially got a great effort from our senior class with three seniors being our top three finishers it was great to see them come out strong and provide us with the big spark they did
9072164 they will have the same marriage rights as other inmates they will be able to marry non inmates but barred from marrying other inmates in prison
9072165 for instance suppose a prisoner finds out another prisoner has money or other assets they might find themselves coerced into a marriage with a more powerful inmate who might try to lay claim to half their assets
9072166 the law requires they treat people the same so thats a good principle to have in mind when they are drafting regulations
9072167 there are around 100 000 people from the subcontinent in the province of brescia and they want to play cricket so the council had to provide pitches to stop people being struck by cricket balls

9072184 people now have more energy in their later years and realise there is nothing left in their marriage once they have had their career and the children have left home
9072185 people just cant afford to get divorced at the minute
9072186 it could be that husbands will think first before heading for the divorce courts at least until the economic landscape settles particularly as the housing market has been so badly affected in the last few months couples may think twice before divorcing and buying elsewhere
9072187 the reality is that couples split up in all economic climates as we have seen throughout our 70 year history families urgently need easy access to emotional support to manage the fallout from conflict when they separate
9072188 eu tinha interesse em voltar a jogar no brasil porque o qatar um pa s complicado para se viver a adapta o n o f cil eu estava adaptado mas a vontade era a de retornar e jogar em uma equipe grande com estrutura por isso optei pelo cruzeiro mesmo n o conhecendo de dentro sei que um clube vitorioso com hist ria

9072192 we need to concentrate efforts to slash carbon emissions and become more energy efficient in order to prevent dangerous climate change but we also need to prepare for how our climate is expected to change in the future the strategy outlines in detail the range of weather conditions facing london which could both seriously threaten our quality of life particularly that of the most vulnerable people and endanger our pre eminence as one of the worlds leading cities
9072193 london is not unique all major cities such as new york and tokyo are at risk from climate change
9072194 it is essential that the capital prepares for the impacts of climate change which is already affecting londoners through increased flood risk heavier and more frequent downpours and extreme heat
9072195 the mayor must provide a comprehensive action plan for reducing emissions that includes ways to make it cheaper and easier for londoners to go green
9072196 in arriving at our final conclusions on public interest immunity and the discretion to order disclosure it will be necessary to consider whether this is a legitimate requirement
9072197 todays judgment discloses the shocking fact that the foreign secretary failed to give any proper weight in secret submissions he made to the court to the abhorrence of torture when he purported to determine that it was in the public interest not to disclose the evidence of ill treatment to our client
9072198 the foreign secretary has balanced mr mohameds right to a fair trial with the strong us desire that this information not be disclosed
9072199 set a chain of events in motion from which it was impossible for us to recover
9072200 we have been working on a financing deal for the company for two months and we have been making very good progress with that
9072201 we fully expected we would be able to continue flying but the problems that we encountered during the day on thursday however with a number of aircraft being seized by airports authorities such as the one in glasgow made it very difficult clearly you cant run an airline without aircraft
9072202 were travelling from edinburgh to ottawa via new york it was around 1 000 for the flights plus we had to pay for a night in a hotel
9072203 we tried to get a flight until 11pm last night thursday then realised wed have to come back this morning friday

9072205 there is no quick fix no magic bullet its relentless scrutiny of attendance behaviour maintaining quality of teaching and learning its basic old fashioned things
9072206 academies were always intended to provide a good school to children in the most deprived postcodes i am most proud of the fact that weve achieved that
9072207 this is a marathon not a sprint we want steady incremental improvements that we can sustain
9072208 this data shows that the government should not expect schools to turn round in a year schools might go up and down but you need to look over a longer timeframe
9072209 whilst it is clear that many academies are achieving excellent results this data shows that in some schools the performance is less impressive
9072210 the strong upward trend in academy gcse results has continued this year 27 of the 36 academies with results this year and last report an increase in the proportion gaining five or more higher grade gcse passes including in english and maths across all these 36 academies the average reported result is an increase of 4 9 percentage points which is likely to be more than twice the national increase this is a similar academy bonus to that recorded in previous years every one of the academies recording a fall this year still has results higher than that of the underperforming school it replaced over 12 percentage points higher on average

9072223 mccain declared as the pair stood together for the first time at a boisterous rally in ohio just days before the opening of the partys national convention
9072224 im going to take our campaign to every part of our country and our message of reform to every voter of every background in every political party or no party at all
9072225 politics isnt just a game of competing interests and clashing parties
9072226 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9072227 governor palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government
9072228 by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done senator mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9072229 we should all be proud of gov sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and sen mccain while their policies would take america in the wrong direction gov palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9072230 he sees sarah governor palin as the future of the party
9072231 these are people hed like to elevate in that regard reformers
9072232 id like to know more about her experience if something happened to him would she be qualified to step into the presidency
9072233 geoffrey perkins embraced comedy talent to create unique programmes which will be enjoyed for a very long time all of our thoughts are with geoffreys family at this very sad time
9072234 it is an absolute tragedy and our thoughts and prayers are with his family
9072235 what in the world was i thinking of last night no way am i quitting today
9072236 this lack of insight while not craving may lead them to make decisions such as choosing to attend a party where there will be lots of smoking that they may come to regret
9072237 in contrast to smokers in a hot craving state those in a cold noncraving state underpredicted the value of smoking during a future session when they would be craving failing to anticipate the motivational strength of cigarette craving nonsmokers may not appreciate how easy it is to become addicted and how difficult it is to quit once addicted
9072238 if smokers cant appreciate the intensity of their need to smoke when they arent currently craving whats the likelihood that people who have never smoked can do so
9072239 which found that although only 15 of respondents who were occasional smokers less than one cigarette per day predicted that they might be smoking in 5 years 43 of them were in fact smoking 5 years later

9072243 congratulations to john mccain for hearing and responding to conservatives conservatives the base of the party have been listless but now nearly all will work enthusiastically for the mccain palin ticket in fact this is the most enthusiastic conservatives have been since the era for ronald reagan

9072276 warren and i were gainfully employed as airline pilots believe or not up until last april when our airline decided to call it quits so im just out spreading the love giving people rides visiting friends and having a good time
9072277 kind of a relaxing weekend for us and a time to enjoy some of these old airplanes and give some folks some rides
9072278 theyre pretty fun its better than any ticket ride at disney world in my opinion
9072279 its the best its sort of like flying a motorcycle and ive never taken up anybody that didnt love it
9072280 its working out well its good for the museum to have some activity around and good for us to have a place to hang out
9072281 its an experience that not many people get to experience anymore i mean this is the real deal from the 1920s its an oldie but a goodie
9072282 in this case the leak in question is an e mail trove alleged to be from a senior aide to venezuelan president hugo chavez
9072283 i phoned gordon up i said we appear to have lost two disks containing the personal details of just about every family in the country we knew it was bad
9072284 theres lots of people whod like to do my job and no doubt
9072285 but weve got a hell of a lot to do we patently have not been able to get across what we are for and what we are about
9072286 yes i do think he can i do think he will

9072288 this step is biased and aimed at justifying the aggressive actions of georgia
9072289 i dont think the contemporary west has any means to punish a state that is not quite a rogue state
9072290 the kremlin didnt take tbilisi and didnt shoot mikheil saakashvili expelling russia from the g8 or the world trade organisation isnt important
9072291 i think they are watching very closely to see what will happen at the eu summit
9072292 but i think the kremlin calculation is that the eu wont react seriously
9072293 alejandro is a great director we made three beautiful films we both are very proud of
9072294 unjustified obsession with claiming the sole authorship of a film
9072295 you were not and you have never allowed yourself to feel part of this team your declarations are a sad and very reductive end to this wonderful collective process that we have lived and are now celebrating
9072296 ive always been driven to the desert i think the landscape itself influences people this movie was based on the four elements water earth wind and fire and using them i wanted to explore why sometimes people are damaged
9072297 we never tell stories in a linear way we always tell them in a decomposed way if you ask how did i become a director i will not begin at the beginning i will talk about my grandfather my trip to italy and so on thats the way we tell stories in real life
9072298 shes so focused and shes smart and shes nice she would stay late and be off camera just for me
9072299 rick philion hazen head coach and i think theyre very excited theyve sat in the wings some of these guys for two three years now behind some talented kids and theyre ready to show what theyve got at the same point inexperience does show every once in a while theres something that happens that they werent ready for and they dont bounce back quite as quick as we hope they would sometimes but hey theyre working hard
9072300 people now have more energy in their later years and realise there is nothing left in their marriage once they have had their career and the children have left home
9072301 people just cant afford to get divorced at the minute
9072302 it could be that husbands will think first before heading for the divorce courts at least until the economic landscape settles particularly as the housing market has been so badly affected in the last few months couples may think twice before divorcing and buying elsewhere
9072303 the reality is that couples split up in all economic climates as we have seen throughout our 70 year history families urgently need easy access to emotional support to manage the fallout from conflict when they separate
9072304 if we are going to conserve them we need to know more about them where they live what causes the nests to die
9072305 the last few years have been really bad for bumblebees we think its probably the weather but we dont know we need to know how many nests there are we need to find the nests to know how long they live and what destroys them
9072306 bumblebees are very important to the environment as pollinators of crops and flowers but sadly they are struggling to survive in the modern world of habitat loss pesticides and intensive agriculture
9072307 further decline in bumblebees could result in a downward cycle of poorer harvests and sweeping changes to the countryside as wild flowers set less seed and disappear which in turn could have catastrophic effects for other wildlife
9072308 weve seen the end of the very big blockbuster the likes of lipitor
9072309 theres not enough time for a product to become a massive blockbuster theres so much competition in the market
9072310 it takes 550m and 10 12 years to bring a new drug to the patient
9072311 its an investment in public health its only natural that the companies need to make a return on this initial investment
9072312 nice needs to combine pure economic arithmetic with other considerations the severity of the condition the availability of alternative treatments the consequences of refusing treatment in terms of the length and quality of life and the savings in the use of carers
9072313 the idea of early dialogue is now accepted on both sides
9072314 the increased rigour in being able to get a product to market means that far more molecules have to be screened before a likely candidate can be positively identified
9072315 we can expect drug research in large well served areas like pain relief to be reduced
9072316 new drugs for niche conditions are likely to be fantastically expensive in many cases it will seem like blackmail without government assistance or insurance treatment will simply not be affordable for many
9072317 the odds seem lower than in the us but the pressures to enhance drug marketing and co opt the regulators are ever present there is a lot of money at stake
9072318 gsk must change if it is to be successful in the future
9072319 are we still underfunding our health service we get good value for money but if we put more money in would peoples health improve
9072320 guidance is for margins to continue falling and arrears to continue rising earnings outlook is therefore very weak the margin issue is the lack of ability to write new business currently available at higher margins at least in part due to funding constraints
9072321 the boards priority has been to ensure that we can continue to fund our business safely and we have achieved this

9072327 the people you speak of were all discoveries of john lehmann a part of his attempt to find a proletarian literature this had its condescending side there is from lehmann and his ilk a homosexual attitude to the working class
9072328 ginsberg found himself confronted with the type writer a story a day that was his minimum task two thousand words preferably with a plot development a climax and a twist after six months of this routine he was beginning to feel an intense hatred of the short story in fact of all writing what an abominable occupation it was
9072329 mr camberton who appears to be devoid of any narrative gift makes this an excuse for dragging in disconnectedly and to little apparent purpose a series of thinly disguised local or literary celebrities
9072330 that he found time to write at all puzzled the little crowd of habitu s which watched him and heard him every evening with respectful animosity at his corner of the bar
9072331 he asked if i wanted tea or whisky and i said whisky maugham said thats right good show im going to have both and then we put english fiction to the sword
9072332 the family realised that the mystical cord which for all his eccentricities bound jake to them and to all that was reasonable and normal had snapped cruelly inexplicably and unnecessarily jake was voluntarily and alone descending to the lowest section of society he was going to become a homeless casual labourer a tramp a criminal even a young man who had no money no job no home no wife no friends was in essence a criminal
9072333 with what strange feelings david opened the thin ill printed yellow wrappered volume it was as though the past itself had been drawn temporarily but without noticeable change from the vaults of the museum
9072334 those two books litvinoff reckoned had nothing to do with the east london he had known as a young man they were opportunistic banal he preferred to remember wolf mankowitz now there was a man who knew how to make money
9072335 oh yes id almost forgotten him roland camberton i saw him once at a party i think like pinter and myself he went to hackney downs school i cant remember whose party it was except that it was somewhere in st johns wood i didnt venture very often into these exotic territories i had this little uneasy chat with camberton a strange man thats it thats all i know
9072336 it was necessary to know every alley every cul de sac every arch every passageway every school every hospital every church every synagogue every police station every post office every labour exchange every lavatory every curious shop name every kids gang every hiding place every muttering old man in fact everything and having got to know everything they had to hold this information firmly to keep abreast of change to locate the new position of beggars newsboys hawkers street shows gypsies political meetings
9072337 johnny minton was one of us he did the covers for henrys books
9072338 dregs and real dregs with the great henry who was an extremely distinguished looking jewish man like a great composer huge brow we drank and we chatted away we bought it must have been me a bottle of wine and we went back to henrys room he said ive just won a prize somerset maugham has given me 500 maugham thought henry was a good storyteller and he was right henry could do colourful characters he had great warmth he loved listening to what you had to say but he didnt like wasting his time doing practical things
9072339 i would scribble bits and pieces and read them out at lunchtime and see who laughed at which passage i was quite surprised they liked my stuff but the bits i liked they found high fallutin and boring
9072340 i was spending all my time in soho living it up as far as i could drinking courting the girls id come from a stuffy orthodox jewish background i found soho life fascinating and i thought other people would want to hear about it i wrote scamp and i remembered john lehmann
9072341 you couldnt say thats what henry was doing freelance journalism
9072342 you couldnt ask henry wasnt a man who did things he just ran out of ideas i should have learnt more from him i didnt take him seriously i think he had an interior purpose he hated to be known he was a very secretive person
9072343 live like rats among the ruins which they themselves have helped to honeycomb
9072344 this very hatton garden sort of chap came around he had a set of sacrificial knives which he used for cutting animals throats henry jumped up this is my brother the brother said ive come to bring you home to hackney henry told me that the same scene happened every week his father was ill
9072345 he was with a very attractive woman i think he must have been knocking about with her for quite a long time she was very gentile very county enormously devoted to him in a distant kind of way she didnt like being associated with soho or drink
9072346 shes got lots of money she wants to get married shes got a house with hunting and that kind of thing i go down there my family have cut me off they dont want to see me i cant go on i dont really have anything to do
9072347 he lost touch completely with the family their relationship was quietly wrapped up as it were placed in the cupboard of limbo and locked away
9072348 good god i can find 20 people to write picaresque novels about hackney i want someone who writes dull as ditchwater technical material
9072349 henrys departure hes a marvellous writer but it takes him weeks to polish a paragraph
9072350 a man who didnt have any interest in making money periton probably got him the job at mgm to keep him afloat nobody knows if henry ever wrote anything else under another name my view is at the times i ran into him he was a declining person he had problems with his inamorata
9072351 accumulated memories do work their way to the surface i have a notion henry married his lady they had a child it could be a whole new chapter in henrys story
9072352 i was born in december 1954 my mothers name was lilian joyce brown she was from andover in hampshire she lived in london during the war working as a silver service waitress at the savoy she was three years younger than my father she died 20 years ago at the age of 64 she was a bit reclusive towards the end of her life and fairly secretive too
9072353 mum liked jewish men it was a bit rebellious at the time my father pursued her and chatted her up mum told me in her rather prim way that he was very virile
9072354 my father made the name up by combining camberwell and brixton he hated them both he hated coming south of the river he was very proud of the fact that he lived in chelsea
9072355 it was all hollywood then everything was a story a romance when mum decided to call herself camberton my father slid away he ended the association
9072356 my father produced a huge stack of legal papers and presented them to my mother isnt that dramatic i was in the pram that was their final parting the end of the relationship there was no further point of contact
9072357 shes three months pregnant and she kills herself the whole theme is right there a woman who is not of his class not in his league and having a child thats probably why he didnt want my mother to read it
9072358 ginsberg was very much aware of her desirable presence by his side so delightful were her little moues and winks that he felt like whispering into her ear an invitation
9072359 until lolita became his mistress ginsberg was delighted with the novelty of this courtship but afterwards there was nothing to sustain their relations except recrudescent desire ginsberg was also still ashamed of lolitas background which though it might supply colour for an adventure an anecdote made a long term affair impossible at the same time he was ashamed of being ashamed

9072375 b amp b results were little short of appalling but this was expected
9072376 in the light of the turbulence in the banking and housing sectors the first six months of this year have been very challenging for b amp b
9072377 in the light of continuing weakness in the housing market and the wider economy we continue to expect arrears and repossessions to increase for the remainder of the year although we will be putting further resources into tackling the problem
9072378 looking forward guidance is for margins to continue falling and arrears to continue rising earnings outlook is therefore very weak management have few levers to pull we fear
9072379 we provisionally expect b amp b to report a loss for 2008 as the loan book shrinks and credit quality deteriorates there is a risk the group remains unprofitable into 2009
9072380 will review our plans to enable us to continue to operate effectively
9072381 set a chain of events in motion from which it was impossible for us to recover
9072382 we have been working on a financing deal for the company for two months and we have been making very good progress with that
9072383 we fully expected we would be able to continue flying but the problems that we encountered during the day on thursday however with a number of aircraft being seized by airports authorities such as the one in glasgow made it very difficult clearly you cant run an airline without aircraft
9072384 were travelling from edinburgh to ottawa via new york it was around 1 000 for the flights plus we had to pay for a night in a hotel
9072385 we tried to get a flight until 11pm last night thursday then realised wed have to come back this morning friday

9072395 set a chain of events in motion from which it was impossible for us to recover
9072396 we have been working on a financing deal for the company for two months and we have been making very good progress with that
9072397 we fully expected we would be able to continue flying but the problems that we encountered during the day on thursday however with a number of aircraft being seized by airports authorities such as the one in glasgow made it very difficult clearly you cant run an airline without aircraft
9072398 were travelling from edinburgh to ottawa via new york it was around 1 000 for the flights plus we had to pay for a night in a hotel
9072399 we tried to get a flight until 11pm last night thursday then realised wed have to come back this morning friday
9072400 with a slight fear of being tackled by police i hopped on the highest counter i could see and shouted out the news
9072401 if youve got an event the size of the olympics and youve got billions and billions of people watching it you definitely have to have a backing track and mime to it because anything could go wrong
9072402 it is just a safety first thing you simply cannot take the risk
9072403 we share artists all the time and conductors all the time
9072404 if it does work out well it will probably be a small plus for us
9072405 obviously if it doesnt work out well then the republicans are going to have a problem
9072406 it is legitimate for the people of pakistan to ask whether that story is true or not and what is his response because so far neither the government of pakistan nor mr zardari has responded
9072407 i would humbly request that he should withdraw his candidature in the supreme national interest in the interest of democratic stability and also in the interest of the future prospects of his party
9072408 mr zardari is the pakistan peoples partys unanimous choice and he accepted our request to take the nomination
9072409 shes exactly who i need shes exactly w advertisement ho this country needs to help me fight the same old washington politics of me first and country second
9072410 i will be honoured to serve next to the next president of the united states
9072411 this is a moment when principle and political independence matter
9072412 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9072413 governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need thats just more of the same
9072414 i will not plead in line with my standpoint as regards to this court
9072415 in other words your plea is one of not guilty to the indictment as a whole
9072416 may i hold you to your word that im not guilty
9072417 defeat the threats of the 21st century terrorism and nuclear proliferation poverty and genocide climate change and disease
9072418 the last best hope of all who are called to the cause of freedom
9072419 nobody knew about his announcement this morning except a traveling aide and the governors chief of staff who found out about this last night
9072420 the fundamental principle behind any selection of a running mate would be whether that person is fully prepared to take over and shares your values your principles your philosophy and your priorities
9072421 you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice
9072422 and i dont think that that would necessarily would rule tom ridge out
9072423 john mccain followed her career and admired her tenacity and her many accomplishments
9072424 she was scheduled for a high profile speaking role at our convention and included in the vp selection process because of his admiration for her strong reform credentials
9072425 she gave a slightly different answer and left the door slightly open as opposed to shutting down all the speculation up front
9072426 es una carrera contrarreloj y si la respuesta llega demasiado tarde o no es suficiente los afganos se ver n obligados a vender sus bienes o dejar sus casas lo que conllevar a un deterioro de la ya fr gil estabilidad que vive el pa s
9072427 las cifras de mortalidad infantil y maternal unas de las m s elevadas del mundo podr an incrementarse en los pr ximos meses
9072428 in a lot of these countries a lot of cinema chains belong to american companies
9072429 each one of those is a human being who had a life and a love i often wondered about their lives who they were what happened to them
9072430 there are so many stories well never know including those babies
9072431 im sure there were a lot of mothers holding babies trying to climb up in the attic couldnt get out couldnt break a hole in the roof we found a lot like that people that died in the attics this is a closure for everybody its one big amen
9072432 i hope those of you who were around during katrina can see the difference in things this time
9072433 i just had to get that out of this trumpet
9072434 its been in there three years just waiting to be played for these people
9072435 my husband took me to see some of his relatives id not seen before i stayed the night then in the morning they brought me breakfast with apricot juice it tasted funny so i asked what was in it they told me nothing just drink
9072436 i never intended to blow myself up when stopped at the checkpoint i wanted to turn myself in but i was afraid
9072437 nobody told me how to use this vest i dont know if they meant to blow me up by remote control i just dont know
9072438 the fact hes not shown up to help me yet shows he must have something to hide
9072439 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
9072440 i ask for respec advertisement t and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
9072441 theres a battle within the therapy world between the pros and antis
9072442 youve got psychiatrists on the one hand who like labelling conditions as medical because then they can treat them but its equally true that behaviour that causes distress to self and others about sex is different to heroin cocaine or tobacco
9072443 its like any addiction its behaviour lacking in meaning and humans are meaning seeking creatures
9072444 at relate we see it is on the increase we have to be careful about what we define as addiction and i think a lot of people who want to have more sex than their partners automatically assume they have an addiction that might not be the case it may be that a discrepancy in libido
9072445 people assume theres some sort of infidelity or visiting prostitutes going on
9072446 many people who come to relate will complain about their use of the internet because they can become addicted to looking at sexual images or going into chatrooms and that can cause distress in the relationship
9072447 let me spell out exactly what change would mean if i am president
9072448 for over two decades mr mccain has subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else
9072449 what it really means is that youre on your own out of work tough luck youre on your own no healthcare the market will fix it youre on your own
9072450 what has been lost these past eight years cant just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits
9072451 what has also been lost is our sense of common purpose
9072452 individual responsibility and mutual responsibility thats the essence of americas promise
9072453 the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 per cent of the time
9072454 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 per cent chance on change
9072455 you cant truly stand up for georgia when youve strained our oldest alliances
9072456 if he makes it to the white house hell have an enormous mess to clean up if it doesnt go as smoothly as wed like to see then critics will say i told you so
9072457 let me spell out exactly what change would mean if i am president
9072458 for over two decades mr mccain has subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else
9072459 what it really means is that youre on your own out of work tough luck youre on your own no healthcare the market will fix it youre on your own
9072460 what has been lost these past eight years cant just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits
9072461 what has also been lost is our sense of common purpose
9072462 individual responsibility and mutual responsibility thats the essence of americas promise
9072463 the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 per cent of the time
9072464 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 per cent chance on change
9072465 you cant truly stand up for georgia when youve strained our oldest alliances
9072466 if he makes it to the white house hell have an enormous mess to clean up if it doesnt go as smoothly as wed like to see then critics will say i told you so
9072467 they started dropping the bombs at seven oclock in the evening of the 11th
9072468 they were black planes the cattle ran all over the place some of the cattle were killed
9072469 independentemente de favoritismo vamos para campo fazer uma boa partida com certeza o s o paulo vai temer o santos n o pelo momento que estamos passando mas pelo clube os ltimos tr s jogos deram nimo para os jogadores
9072470 tratando se de um cl ssico sempre um gosto especial de marcar gol mas pela fase que o santos se encontra n o d para pensar nisso e sim em vencer o jogo com todo respeito ao s o paulo mas estamos em uma crescente forte
9072471 at least this week it has been busier than anywhere in iraq busier than johannesburg
9072472 ive been in theatre six weeks and in that time weve dealt with around 500 casualties
9072473 which ever way you look at it thats substantial everything has shot up since july
9072474 obama is an arrogant elitist disdainful of the folks in middle america
9072475 we played pretty good soccer but we didnt do the little things right
9072476 actually the school mails us a letter to let us know that they have a free clinic if they need any shots or school physicals so they just mail it in the mail with the school rosters thats how i first heard about it
9072477 its no shots no school so its very important for us that kids start on a good note start on the right day get started the first day of school
9072478 i needed to get information because i had a lot of well actually i read a lot so i was looking at jenny mccarthy talking about her son so that interests me cause i really liked her
9072479 so this does raise the concern that we might see a resurgence of illnesses like measles
9072480 leaving the baby in the bushes like that if the baby hadnt been found it probably wouldnt have survived for long
9072481 after the current government is ousted we will propose a totally new political system with those corrupt guys prosecuted and we will have a clean and efficient political system
9072482 they want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out and do the coup again
9072483 oh gosh i sure hope someone does something about this
9072484 wondering how palin can compare herself to women who actually support and fight for womens rights
9072485 overheard rush limbaugh summed up sarah palin this way guns babies jesus that about sums it up
9072486 sarah is certainly not hillary the only thing they have in common is their gender
9072487 christ on a crutch already one shouldnt wake to the fact that a former podunk mayor with less than two years experience is the new vp pick
9072488 omg i just remembered palin will have to debate joe biden itll be just like christmas
9072489 i would love to see a woman in the white house but come on
9072490 sarah palin because shes a woman right i just threw up in my mouth a little bit
9072491 hey if palins vp i really hope not then we dont need ted who needs 4th or is it 5th in line for president when you have 1st
9072492 if mccain gets elected and dies and the vp takes over will they finally ship to ak
9072493 do not press the alarm give me all the large bills in your drawer i have a gun i do not want to hurt anyone no dye no bait money you have 10 seconds
9072494 more people watched obama speak than watched the olympics opening
9072495 chinese government to spend 78 percent more on energy efficiency emission reduction
9072496 total investment in fixed assets in urban areas kept surging in from january to july
9072497 despite intensive coverage of other gold medalists personal lives during the games nbc failed to mention that mitcham was gay or shoot footage of the divers partner cheering him on and congratulating him after his win
9072498 in every case i could show you 500 athletes we didnt show we dont show everyone we dont show every ceremony
9072499 i have no reason to believe that anything is going to occur that will trigger the activation of that center but my greatest concern is any disruption of the event
9072500 i expect monday afternoon theres going to be a lot of chatter
9072501 weve done super bowls weve done state of the union addresses inaugurations
9072502 i pick up the phone the public works guy here answers the phone and immediately we have the sand trucks we need to clear an accident or a tow truck we need to get somebody off the freeway
9072503 we have a lot of experience at managing these sorts of events
9072504 border between the state of lebanon and the state of hezbollah
9072505 we are not two camps we are in the same camp confronting israel
9072506 youre going to see a lot of people who are extremely skeptical it would seem that you would need a little more time
9072507 a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
9072508 i never thought in a million years hed be this far away
9072509 i think the first thing i said was couldnt he have found some licence plates from north carolina
9072510 were just guessing but we figure he was lured over to the campground by the smell of hamburgers and hot dogs
9072511 hes very friendly so im not sure if he decided to settle down in somebodys camper perhaps from montreal who returned home with him to montreal
9072512 hes always been a bit of a wanderer but i said montreal canada
9072513 i really felt like i was going to find him again he was very healthy and had long hair
9072514 a changing environment will affect alaska more than any other state because of our location im not one though who would attribute it to being man made
9072515 mccain came around on ocs i anticipate the same with anwr
9072516 the epidemics curve appears to show that we have not yet reached the end of the outbreak because there have still been recent cases
9072517 it is reasonable to believe that these products could pose a threat to public health
9072518 the company is offering its full co operation and is applying all appropriate measures to protect the health of consumers
9072519 i think its going to be more profound and long lasting than people thought
9072520 we really have to make our minds up are we ready to try and persuade this country to support us for another term because the next 12 months are critical its still there to play for
9072521 at some stage before the end of the parliament he brown will want to do a reshuffle but im not expecting one imminently i do not think there will be a reshuffle
9072522 if people give you a shelter you should take it
9072523 gustav could become a major hurricane near the time it crosses western cuba
9072524 weve taken in all the balcony furniture all the pool furniture the marquees tied up what needs to be tied up cut down any coconuts
9072525 approximately 80 per cent of offenders coming into the system have some type of substance abuse problem
9072526 it helps the gangs that develop in the system organized crime and the hierarchy develops
9072527 so for the first time in their life theres a possibility where they can actually be in a drug free environment and actually break free of addictions that ruin the lives of so many people
9072528 we have brought up several of our concerns which we see incorporated in this
9072529 its good to see that they are actually taking the zero tolerance stance very seriously
9072530 we want to see those enhanced but for those to be effective we have to stop the flow of drugs into the institution
9072531 were going to have a drug problem in prisons for as long as we persist in pursuing an unworkable drug control strategy outside prisons
9072532 its a fallacy to think that we can successfully make prisons drug free when 100 years of drug prohibition has not made canadian society drug free
9072533 they were shocked they were shocked and they were angry about not being aware of it
9072534 theres a lot of people relying on that type of information in order to be safe and secure these corrections workers they want to go home to their families at the end of the day just like we do
9072535 were here today to say that there was a communication problem at that jail
9072536 if what the minister is saying is accurate that management knew 10 days in advance there was a serious breakdown of what should have happened there as far as the information going from management down to the workers on the floor
9072537 when they got that information they should have instituted a lock down immediately and went through the facility
9072538 i dont want to see somebody killed because somebody isnt doing what they have to do to make these places safe he said
9072539 these searches are being undertaken to ensure the safety of the public and the safety of all corrections workers
9072540 facility directors have been instructed to call in all staff required to complete this task as quickly as possible

9072543 well the recalls therell be a few more as we get out into the secondary processors and some of the third line
9072544 some of this product went out somewhere and other sandwiches were made out of it thats the nature of the recalls as they grow
9072545 the most important information for consumers is as we go out there we are providing further precision that informs them and lets them recognize these products in ways they werent able to do with the initial recall
9072546 it certainly does shake the confidence of consumers to know that its taking this amount of time
9072547 it just demonstrates that our need to make sure that we have absolute vigilance throughout this process is paramount
9072548 in the u s they had a legislated commitment to visit the plants daily
9072549 we took a different approach originally which meant that those tasks were applied by the inspectors spending more time in the plants though not necessarily on a daily basis
9072550 with our system we were able to pick it up with relatively small numbers otherwise it might have gone unnoticed
9072551 it helped us to connect the dots in such a way that we were able to say we have something provincially going on
9072552 whats up with all these riot cops do they really need those huge clubs my husband is a real police officer he works undercover with the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms he doesnt have to act tough he never talks about his work
9072553 its okay i mean there are ghettoish parts of town too where are you guys staying
9072554 oh see thats a nice area but if you go a little further down the road it gets ghettoish its all mexicans and asians
9072555 that sounds horrible im sorry i didnt mean it that way i just mean like there was a gang fight and a shooting just the other day
9072556 he met a congressman who was at the i have a dream speech during the civil rights movement
9072557 if obama wins he wont make it to next year
9072558 if obama wins the election he wont even make it to his first term people are gonna be pissed
9072559 youre that sure about it whats the spread on that are you willing to lay down money on that bet
9072560 i mean im not saying i want anything to happen but there are a lot of people out there who are gonna go crazy if obama wins its gonna be war in the streets
9072561 i was at a show last week they flew in tali kwalib and mos def from switzerland
9072562 if obama wins i just hope that black people dont start thinking theyre superior
9072563 steve ballmer and sir howard stringer are driving forces behind the continued growth of the consumer technology industry

9072569 this means it can spot names or numbers that crop up alongside anyone already of interest to the authorities and then catalogue any documents that contain such associates
9072570 as a tool to help the security services tackle crime and terrorism
9072571 authorized groups need to have direct access to communications between suspects whether it is individuals groups or organizations only then can they take appropriate action detect prevent and anticipate crimes and guarantee peace and security
9072572 from nontraditional sources such as public safety entities and private sector organizations
9072573 to anticipate identify prevent and or monitor criminal and terrorist activity
9072574 a vast database of names that feeds the nations terrorist watch list
9072575 would actually be less capable than the u s government terrorist tracking system it is meant to replace
9072576 the program appears to be on the brink of collapse after an estimated half billion dollars in taxpayer funding has been spent on it
9072577 technical flaws hinder terrorist watch list congress calls for investigation
9072578 recent weeks the government has fired most of the 862 private contractors from dozens of companies working on the railhead project and only a skeleton crew remains
9072579 calls to officials of boeing and sri were not immediately returned
9072580 currently there are no good patterns available to recognise terrorists he says and questions whether siemens has got around this
9072581 for a moratorium on the development of fusion technologies referring explicitly to the siemens intelligence platform
9072582 the efficiency and reliability of such tools is as yet unknown more surveillance does not necessarily lead to a higher level of societal security hence there must be a thorough examination of whether the resulting massive constraints on human rights are proportionate and justified
9072583 our times are good and the car is pretty consistent over the long run as well
9072584 now we need to repeat this performance in the qualifying on saturday to create ideal prerequisites for sunday on this narrow circuit
9072585 we can definitely be satisfied with the times we set weve seen a very compact team performance we did a good job of applying our set up work to the track and drove fast times over the long run thats a good base for saturday
9072586 this is shaping up to be a great weekend for us
9072587 the guys have been working hard getting the cars up to 110 percent and the drivers are well prepared its a great facility with a great track layout lots of high speed flat out sections as well as some good technical corners and elevation changes thrown in its got a great track surface and it gets a little skinny in places it should be an interesting and fun race after our bad luck at trois rivieres everyone is ready to bounce back and have an iowa repeat but this time with a 1 2 3 finish
9072588 qualifying was exciting i think we had enough to get pole but with the changing conditions from the practice sessions we had a little bit too much at the rear the rear tires came in before the fronts and hence we had a little too much understeer that is fixable for tomorrow
9072589 we never could make a qualifying setup for the dry every time we went out we were fastest in the rain when it was dry other teams could go back to their setups from last year but the ferrari for us is a new car so we didnt know really what we had for the dry we gambled and i think we had a pretty good setup third place is very good the race is long tomorrow and it is important to stay out of trouble as we have seen at long beach and st petersburg is very important to stay out of trouble if you brake late you are in the wall and if you dont look in your mirrors you have contact with the prototypes for sure this is the hardest one to stay out of trouble we have to stick to our position and we cant get a gap between and the flying lizards
9072590 we got everything right on the second practice we had been quickest in both the sessions in qualifying there was one corner still wet where you are under braking there is some time that could be gained there if you risked a lot but it was our first try on the slick and not worth the risk position three is ok i think the combination is able to do pole but it was difficult for everybody congratulations to wolf henzler he obviously got a good lap it was close traffic is going to be the issue in the race we have saw it last year lots of incidents lots of contact hopefully last weekends work will pay off this weekend
9072591 it was a pretty messed up first day with the weather especially with the program jim and i had it just didnt work out like we had planned it now at the end of the day i think i have eight laps at detroit thats the only way it was going to work out the weather bit us a little bit jim did a great job not having any laps in the dry he got much faster every lap ill just have to go out there and find my way around for the start of my stint no big deal it is a long race
9072592 my confidence is really good i couldnt get the car to turn and it started to push that was where i left all my time alex and i will go and try and run a solid race and look for a good finish with the 73 ferrari
9072593 so far so good especially for being at a track that no one has been on before
9072594 this is just a testament to alex job racing and all of the guys our engineer greg fordahl put a great setup on the car this is very exciting for us this is what i knew this team was capable of racing is all about momentum and right now weve got good momentum heading into tomorrow
9072595 i actually like the track in terms of driving its great there are a couple of little issues with it there is an issue with the pit out road there is an issue with the dust when cars go off when that happens you drive into days of thunder style clouds of dirt where you have no idea whats on the other side its actually very scary they had to fix the pit in wall because scott pruetts car hit it yesterday those are three things that need to be changed but overall i think these guys did a really good job designing a racetrack that is fun to drive
9072596 we only made a couple of very small changes other than that the car is really good joey and the team have done a great job were looking good and now weve just want to keep it up front
9072597 overall i like track i think that once they get some of these little things ironed out i think it will be really nice to drive on they need to be able to control the dust they also need to be able to make the pit entrance safe but all in all its a very fun challenging and fast track it kind of reminds me of vir with its fast turns
9072598 we were p1 in both sessions which backed up what we did yesterday in the test session both bill and joey have done a tremendous job driving my engineer greg fordahl has done an unbelievable job for greg to hit the setup like he did here it just shows the strength of our engineer
9072599 we unloaded the car from the trailer like this in fact weve only made a couple of small changes to it it just unloaded this fast the good thing about coming here is the fact that this is the first time any of us have been here which is the great equalizer
9072600 we will have to analyse in detail what the problem was until the accident the test was going okay but we had a few problems around midday then in the afternoon i think track conditions were a bit slower and we couldnt really make strong progress the crash was not nice and im not sure what happened wed had a bit of understeer and the kerb riding was not too comfortable but i wasnt aware of making a mistake we will have to have a close look at the data
9072601 it was unfortunate that timo went off just before the end but if it has to happen at all better then than at the beginning of the day we had already worked through the majority of the schedule which was aimed at familiarising timo with the specific demands of monza which are quite different to other circuits we did a lot of experimentation with brake feel ride heights and general aerodynamic set up it has been a productive three days with consistent conditions and no weather interruptions i want to thank everyone for their efforts we have collected a lot of data and will take it all into account before the italian grand prix here next month
9072602 i can tell you one thing i know for certain we are going to have more chance of doing damage in the finals than carlton essendon richmond fremantle melbourne et cetera
9072603 s urely a better way to assess the depth and quality of a nation is to take a look at the per capita medal table the table that puts medal totals in proportion to population size

9072611 they have all kinds of organizations and labor union structures were not like that we work hard we tolerate bitter exertion
9072612 other than north korea theres not one other country in the world that can achieve such a high quality performance

9072617 millions forfeit water to olympic games farmers in baoding face ruin from a man made drought

9072619 by allowing beijing to host the games you will help the development of human rights
9072620 ioc president jacques rogge talks exclusively to bbc news 24s hardtalk
9072621 winning 5 0 is something weve thought about and talked about
9072622 and there is no reason why we cant do it
9072623 it puts extra pressure on us because that could take us up to second in the world but pressure is a privilege its the sort of pressure we want
9072624 so 5 0 is a goal and it takes us towards the top along with australia
9072625 bell and prior at the top of the order that opening stand was magnificent we know how brilliant owais shah is freddie was absolutely brilliant again
9072626 who was at six colly colly was unfortunate today who was at seven oh my little friend
9072627 we played cricket together for notts five to six years ago his performance was absolutely brilliant he batted superbly with freddie he took a great catch to get rid of kallis a huge wicket for us and then he batted like sanath jayasuriya
9072628 there is no fear in this dressing room i played for england lions earlier this summer and made a statement with 60 not out so they knew i could bat they didnt come hard enough at me today which made me feel comfortable freddie talked me through it brilliantly
9072629 im very disappointed by how england have outplayed us in all three disciplines
9072630 this part of the tour has been hugely disappointing i havent been pleased by the application shown by my batsmen but it would be unfair to single out just the batters our bowling has been below par too
9072631 weve got four bowlers bowling at 90mph and two of them bat as well were doing a really good job on south africa at the moment
9072632 this is a landmark announcement not just in the american le mans series but for north american motorsport in general
9072633 we have said for some time that our platform which encourages manufacturers to develop new technologies and relevant automotive innovation is ideally suited for the challenges the auto industry faces and as concerns over oil energy and climate change continue to play prominently in headlines around the world here is an example that offers a practical real world advancement that will be tested and developed in the most extreme environment in the world
9072634 if it proves successful it will transcend motorsports by its social and technical relevance
9072635 zytek and corsa motorsports deserve admiration and applause for taking this tremendous step in bringing another alternative power source into the american le mans series
9072636 we are thrilled with the confirmation of this ground breaking entry debuting at petit le mans and the green challenge as it is an ideal example of why the american le mans series truly is the global leader of green racing
9072637 zytek is well known within the motorsports industry for its race winning prototype cars and engines
9072638 however what most are not aware of is that zytek is a world leader in gas electric hybrid technologies for road cars in fact many of the largest auto manufacturers are utilizing zytek hybrid technology in their road car applications the zytek corsa hybrid lmp1 car represents the cutting edge of hybrid development with technologies being developed on the race car that will soon be transferred to the road cars of tomorrow
9072639 i am truly excited about this opportunity with zytek not simply because zytek constructs one of the best le mans prototype cars but because of the technological relevance this car represents as society looks to the worlds need for global energy reform the lmp1 chassis will be fitted with a full hybrid system one that is untried in the harsh conditions of endurance racing if it proves successful it will transcend motorsports by its social and technical relevance bringing such technology forward in a safe reliable and competitive manner is a true challenge our excitement is bolstered by the fact that the american le mans series the only remaining non spec series actively promotes the development and use of such technologies confirming the series position as the most relevant series in motorsports as society begs for changes in energy consumption and carbon footprints corsa is pleased to have the opportunity to be a part of the research and development of this technology which will one day find itself beneficial to everyday lives outside of motorsport
9072640 we are delighted that on the 10th anniversary of the panoz q9 hybrid le mans car we have been able to resurrect the project with the help of steve pruitt and corsa motorsports obviously our technology has progressed rapidly over this period and our new car encompasses these advances
9072641 however the whole of idea of the q10 is to increase our rate of development of hybrid drivetrains for road car use the motorsports arena is a perfect environment to develop new ideas and train engineers the vast majority of zyteks road car products have evolved from our involvement in motorsport races run under the le mans rules are by far the most rewarding development medium since they encourage new technologies in a competitive environment their endurance character enables us to evolve road car technologies in a more structured situation than most other series which tend towards one make springs the le mans organizers seem very much in touch with the real world needs to save fuel and lower emissions we look forward to developing our q10 hybrid racecar over the coming years starting with a toe in the water at petit le mans in october
9072642 it was a productive day working through the usual things for monza where i hope we can maintain the form that we have been showing and which has taken us to fourth place in the constructors championship we concentrated mainly on the important things for this track which are an efficient aerodynamic set up good braking feel and the need to feel comfortable over the kerbs im satisfied with progress
9072643 we carried on with the programme that we started yesterday concentrating on set up
9072644 esimesed aastad p rast adele matuseid oli rahulik sammas adele m lestuseks pandi p sti vast paar aastat tagasi hiljem valati sellele ka uus tugev ja massiivne alus aga isegi siis t ugati sammas mber
9072645 neid kordi ei oska les lugedagi mullu l kati kivi mber pea iga n dal mitu korda j rjest ja seda jaanip evast lehtede langemiseni v lja
9072646 ei oska elda nagu n iaring eluaeg olen siinkandis elanud ka adele elas siin vaid poole kilomeetri kaugusel kalmistust kuid kes see olla v iks sellist massilist he samba mberl kkamist ei m leta mina k ll ehkki t tasin kalmistul aastaid
9072647 no jonni elavaga aga mitte surnuga peab ikka hirmus viha olema
9072648 tundsin adelet ka ise aga ei oska mina elda kas tal m ni vaenlane oli kes p rast surma ka rahule ei j ta
9072649 ma ise m tlen ka nii aga ei oska kedagi kahtlustada polnud mu emal htki vihavaenlast
9072650 ka toona alustati kriminaalasja politseinikud k isid kaks n dalat jutti iga r ngu kalmistul luuramas aga ei saadud kurjategijat k tte ja uurimine l petati 27 augustil teatati meile uuesti ja alustasime taas uurimist
9072651 igal kevadel tuleb uued kivid vedada sest aasta jooksul l heb kaduma umbes kaks kolm s iduauto k ru t it kive
9072652 see soov midagi ra viia on nii suur et v etakse aiast suur kivi kaenlasse ja hakatakse seda s iduauto poole vedama kuna pangale s ita ei tohi siis poolel teel puhatakse kuid siis venitatakse kivi ikkagi auto pagasnikusse
9072653 eks neid p hjusi v ib olla mitu kes tahab viia kivi enda kiviktaimlasse kes soovib suveniiri
9072654 valus on vaadata kui kena asi on j lle ra l hutud

9072656 obviously its time to pull out anything you can possibly come up with
9072657 this is the type of track we have been struggling with this year
9072658 we know going into richmond we should be ok there but it sure would be nice to gain a little bit of leeway coming out of california
9072659 i feel like if we just go out and not make many mistakes kind of like our whole year if we dont hurt ourselves i think well be fine when they drop the checkered flag on sunday
9072660 they cant have many mistakes i think the car in the next two weeks that clicks off two top five finishes or two top 10 finishes is going to be in the chase and someones going to have that bad race or a tough luck deal getting caught in the pits on a green flag stop or something kind of freakish like that and find themselves on the outside
9072661 if they have some races where they are a little slower and were good then well probably make the chase
9072662 nascar is a sport that is sponsor dependent i know gem has been working hard to find sponsorship and im amazed that they found all the sponsorship this year mr gillett is paying for some of it out of his pocket i dont expect them to do that every year
9072663 for sure its a shock to learn someone else is taking your spot but they are still working to get that fourth car out there a lot of teams want to go to four cars and this is one of them
9072664 there are a lot of cars that havent decided on a driver yet
9072665 ganassi and penske and a few other teams yates and a few guys want to add some cars or change so well see what it is there are a lot of drivers out there knocking on doors
9072666 after the race ill get on a helicopter with tony and fly to the airport well get on his plane and hell drop me off at the carbondale ill airport ill hop in the rental car grab a shower at the hotel and then meet the boys in the lobby because i think practice is at 9 a m
9072667 its been fun every year because after we get out the cars tony and i usually talk all the way to illinois which isnt that long of a flight its three and a half hours or something
9072668 san francisco voters will be asked to decide whether to name a city sewage plant in honor of president bush after a satiric measure qualified for the november ballot today backers of the measure who for several months circulated a petition to place the measure on the ballot turned in more than 12 000 signatures on july 7 said organizer brian mcconnell the department of elections today informed those supporters the self proclaimed presidential memorial commission that they had enough valid signatures a minimum of 7 168 registered san francisco voters to qualify for the november ballot he said
9072669 atualmente existe um panorama muito dif cil para v rias das l nguas ind genas no m xico
9072670 if it seems too good to be true it probably is
9072671 it looks like more of the same it looks dry and skies should be mostly clear
9072672 a warming trend we have a large area of high pressure thats going to be building into the region it should just be a really nice holiday weekend since its been so dry it shouldnt be too humid
9072673 obviously theyre going down but our reservoirs are still 80 to 85 percent full which is really pretty good for this time of year
9072674 were not seeing the drawdown compared to other areas around us our reservoirs are designed to be able to absorb these dry periods
9072675 were probably three to four inches behind in terms of water for the past few months it will influence how big the ears are
9072676 its going to vary tremendously from field to field we started off in a bad place to start off with the wet weather
9072677 we need the rain the remnants of that could bring some rain late next week
9072678 its still pretty far out and theres a lot of uncertainty but thats our next best chance of rain its looking dry until at least thursday
9072679 the family does not feel safe here my familys safety is no 1
9072680 meaning it needs to be repaired but it poses no danger to the community
9072681 if we felt that there was a danger there we would fix it
9072682 one of their representatives on the phone told me just keep an eye out for people walking by lighting cigarettes or throwing cigarettes out the car
9072683 thats not my responsibility im not going to take time out of my day to baby sit everybody who walks up and down here
9072684 i remember when the house on west high street exploded and now this year with the incident out at tuttle construction
9072685 i feel like the gas company just doesnt really care
9072686 we make it smell for a reason because we want people to call us when they smell it
9072687 then its our job to come out and determine what it is what kind of leak it is
9072688 it was something i didnt expect and gov palins pro life message makes her unstoppable in this area
9072689 we had a perfect view we could see them coming out of the chute
9072690 i met all kinds of people it was a really diverse crowd and it was packed solid
9072691 the area of biomarkers for disease is incredibly exciting at the moment and this relatively ignored area of research even 10 years ago has exploded into the cancer arena
9072692 we really wanted to push the envelope and think about risk assessment
9072693 we really wanted to push the envelope and think about risk assessment
9072694 this one just stood out so strongly in our breast cancer patients
9072695 a noninvasive approach would be a godsend for these patients
9072696 this is not a case of whodunit every one of those documents every one of them goes back to miss polen
9072697 who ended up with the money the only thing the state can say is it was dee dees drawer it was dee dees money well show me the money
9072698 i do it for the veterans i just believe in veterans day at the county fair
9072699 its exactly what ohio needs we still have a long way to go its impossible to understand unless youve done it the sacrifice of the military family
9072700 it means a lot especially seeing the world war ii vets and every year theres less and less
9072701 you need to calm down you cant go out and drive upset so why dont you just take a few deep breaths walk around and maybe visit the gift shop before you go
9072702 i cant hang around dad ive got to get to work i just wanted to talk to someone for a minute and thought of you
9072703 im glad you did i think you need to do something that helps you relax maybe pick up an ice cream cone or something on your way to work
9072704 if the money can be raised to buy this painting

9072747 the republican national committee demanded monday that television networks stop running a television ad by the democratic party that falsely suggests john mccain wants a 100 year war in iraq
9072748 if all he offers is more of the same is john mccain the right choice for americas future
9072749 maybe 100 as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed thatd be fine with me and i hope it would be fine with you if we maintain a presence in a very volatile part of the world where al qaida is training recruiting equipping and motivating people every single day
9072750 you learn a lot of different ways but for me the best way to learn is to go out there and experience it for yourself
9072751 i think troy and kyle have separated themselves from joe in terms of being ready to line up and win a football game for us at this level
9072752 i would have to say it hurt him it retarded his development because he never got a chance to really learn
9072753 the great thing about it is i dont think i have to give out that information at this time
9072754 it looked as though he was about to get that nod
9072755 we had a quarterback who very well could have been our starter miss all that time so well kind of have to factor that into the equation as we go forward
9072756 but by the same token hes had a lot of reps from the very first minicamp on through so he knows our offense
9072757 i think joe is in a place where he can compete for us as opening day starter
9072758 now whether thats the best thing for us well have to see in the next four or five days but hes handled himself very well
9072759 hopefully i can get back but health is more important right now because its a long season and i feel the team is going to need me more down the line than early
9072760 ive been making sure its getting right seeing every doctor you can possibly see to make sure nothing bad is going to happen
9072761 ive been playing this game for a long time and i pray i can continue to do that you got to be smart
9072762 we attempted to sign him when he was a free agent we feel like he adds depth to our quarterback situation
9072763 were smack in the middle of a sea of 6 73s 6 74s and 6 75s
9072764 the car was actually struggling to get up on its tires so we werent quite as aggressive as we could have been it wasnt out of control it was just a little weak down low i think everyone kind of underestimated the track that round
9072765 we can definitely improve theres no question our car has more in it i dont know if well have a chance to move up because so much depends on the weather conditions but i can assure you well improve in relation to the field
9072766 orp is a great facility and we love being here
9072767 were trying to have some fun this weekend and get revved up for the playoffs its imperative we arrive in charlotte in a few weeks with everything in order
9072768 im also really happy to have my brother troy back racing this weekend in the jegs promod challenge hes been out for the last four months but hes got a new car thats shown a bunch of promise so far in testing ill be cheering him on every step of the way
9072769 if it seems too good to be true it probably is
9072770 were gonna have businesses on the first floor its a big structure a good looking structure in downtown crystal falls
9072771 we dont have to spend money to build it somewhere else in a while new area
9072772 the buildings have been built over time so its really important for a building like this which means so much to the community to be preserved

9072776 plenty of attention has been paid to the importance of the native vote this election season but less scrutiny has focused on whether american indians especially those who are largely proficient in their tribal languages over english have been given sufficient resources to understand ballots and other election materials the issue is reaching a boiling point for members of four tribal communities in alaska who are currently arguing in federal court that state and local election officials havent provided them with effective oral language assistance and voting materials in their traditional yupik language yupik is the primary form of communication for natives in the bethel alaska region the american civil liberties union and the native american rights fund both of which are representing the native plaintiffs in the case say that with the exception of two poorly translated radio ads in 2006 no other election information has been provided to date in the yupik language

9072782 an initiative to take redistricting out of the hands of the legislature will be on the november ballot backed by a couple of strange political bedfellows

9072785 the texas democratic party says its presidential delegate awarding system is not subject to the federal voting rights act which protects minority voters

9072787 ensure that various minority interests have full participation and inclusion
9072788 agencies had caught on that chennault was the go between between nixon and his people and president thieu in saigon the idea was to bring things to a stop in paris and prevent any show of progress
9072789 im speaking on behalf of mr nixon its very important that our vietnamese friends understand our republican position and i hope you made that clear to them
9072790 many republican friends have contacted me and encouraged me to stand firm
9072791 the longer the present situation continues the more favorable for us i am regularly in touch with the nixon entourage
9072792 in the end though johnsons advisers decided it was too late and too potentially damaging to u s interests to uncover what had been going on
9072793 if nixon should emerge as the victor what would the chennault outrage do to his viability as an incoming president and what effect would it have on american opinion about the war
9072794 you couldnt surface it the country would be in terrible trouble
9072795 you should know that in 1980 the republicans approached me with an arms deal if i could arrange to keep the hostages in iran until after the elections
9072796 the offer to arafat was if you block the release of hostages then the white house would be open for the plo
9072797 i guess the same offer was given to others and i believe that some accepted to do it and managed to block the release of hostages
9072798 told me that if i do not accept this proposal they the republicans would make the same offer to my rivals
9072799 lastly he told me my refusal of their offer would result in my elimination
9072800 hypothetically speaking president bush advised that he would not have directed anyone to investigate the possibility that clinton had renounced his citizenship because he would have relied on others to make this decision

9072806 i dont really want to get into daily progress reports of how it went but it was something that we decided to do last week
9072807 were going to just keep progressing this weekend and going through next week and hopefully we can just keep feeling better
9072808 it was good to get back there doing the same things the rest of the guys were doing having to do rehab having to miss practice its not really the situation that you want to be in
9072809 so it was good to get back out there get in uniform be around the guys and hopefully that can be the sort of the norm from here on out
9072810 certainly ive been preparing for the season opener for some time from a film standpoint its good to get back out there on the field and do more physical activity
9072811 i feel i got in some good practices this week i thought that was important
9072812 certainly being associated with the organization makes that a lot more possible there have been conversations for a lot of years about me being part of a performance at a super bowl
9072813 im hoping that this leads definitely to that this whole process is basically you scratch my back ill scratch yours

9072838 yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward governor palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9072839 it is pretty audacious for the obama campaign to say that governor palin is not qualified to be vice president

9072994 at best copy protection does nothing good for legitimate users and only annoys software pirates at worst it makes it difficult to install software onto a hard disk and to make backup copies that are vital if the original is lost or destroyed it slows the performance of some programs and causes snarls in others it can be a pain for networks of pcs hooked together to share data and peripherals and worst of all there have been reports that some killer protection schemes have destroyed hard disk files inadvertently or otherwise software makers who have abandoned copy protection this year seem to be avoiding bankruptcy and they have certainly gained goodwill when the goodwill comes from big corporate buyers including the federal government which has refused to buy copy protected software it is likely that the losses from pirated software can be offset
9072995 the online music industry has evolved so that while there are open file format standards notably mp3 the major companies have so far preferred proprietary or licensed file formats protected by drm systems
9072996 the funding for the fringe is just pitiful when you consider its the worlds biggest arts festival its shocking that it receives so little compared to the edinburgh international festival when you consider the benefits it brings
9072997 although the fringe does not programme any shows it could do a huge amount with reasonable public funding particularly in terms of rearing new talent there should be year round work going on with school drama and music departments
9072998 the fringe should be looking to recruit some of the best people in the country to take charge of the box office sponsorship and development work to do that it needs significant additional funding
9072999 we need to look at the whole role of the head of the fringe in the context of the wider review that will be going on however we do need a leader someone who can be an inspiration and motivator and a strategist to look at the fringes place in the city in the uk as a whole and its context in the world
9073000 the fringe is the biggest arts festival in the world and i do believe we should be looking to attract a real world class individual
9073001 the title of a director is a bit of a misnomer and suggests that the role is more creative than it actually is we should be looking to create a role of chief executive and look at the kind of salary the position would attract
9073002 the amount of funding the fringe attracts is risible at the moment having a proper chief executive is a fantastic idea and would help the fringe take a much more proactive role
9073003 i dont think there is any need to panic at the moment
9073004 the fringe has enjoyed great success over the years and there have been a number of factors to consider this year we are content to wait to see the results of the various reviews
9073005 we want to have a product with total traceability from cane seeding to the final product we believe theres a market for this kind of product especially in europe

9073013 i most want to get a kit deal so that i dont keep buying equipment for swimming
9073014 the smart athletes should wait for the dust to settle
9073015 brands are going to want to have a gold medallist in their portfolio in the run up to 2012
9073016 the whole point is that we want to take visa to as many people as possible the athletes can do that
9073017 theres a slight lessening of the sponsorship because of the sheer number of gold medals we won and the number of sportsmen and women involved
9073018 someone like christine because shes an olympic champion in athletics can earn up to 50 000 just for turning up to events
9073019 many pensioners already worrying about whether they can afford to heat their homes this winter will be outraged by news of yet more colossal price hikes
9073020 it is a huge worry that one in three pensioner households are likely to be living in fuel poverty by the end of 2008 and many are already feeling forced to cut back on essential food or fuel
9073021 all the major suppliers have increased prices for a second time this year this is a heavy blow and few households will emerge unscathed or unconcerned about the future affordability of their energy
9073022 these are difficult times and we understand the financial impact this announcement will have on our customers although were one of the last companies to announce increases were sorry we couldnt hold on any longer however we have worked very hard to protect people for as long as possible from these considerable increases in the wholesale market

9073026 theres never in my experience been so many changes in such a short time add to that the ambitions of the childrens plan and it is a massive agenda for every school in the country its too much at once
9073027 each of these changes has merit but the problem is the numbers that are coming at one time
9073028 i am very happy for every religion to maintain its identity while still fully participating in the civic life of the country but i am not persuaded that faith schools are the best way to heal our fractured society
9073029 with the end of the olympics in beijing all eyes turned for a moment to london site of the upcoming 2012 summer olympics
9073030 there is no quick fix no magic bullet its relentless scrutiny of attendance behaviour maintaining quality of teaching and learning its basic old fashioned things
9073031 academies were always intended to provide a good school to children in the most deprived postcodes i am most proud of the fact that weve achieved that
9073032 this is a marathon not a sprint we want steady incremental improvements that we can sustain
9073033 this data shows that the government should not expect schools to turn round in a year schools might go up and down but you need to look over a longer timeframe
9073034 whilst it is clear that many academies are achieving excellent results this data shows that in some schools the performance is less impressive
9073035 the strong upward trend in academy gcse results has continued this year 27 of the 36 academies with results this year and last report an increase in the proportion gaining five or more higher grade gcse passes including in english and maths across all these 36 academies the average reported result is an increase of 4 9 percentage points which is likely to be more than twice the national increase this is a similar academy bonus to that recorded in previous years every one of the academies recording a fall this year still has results higher than that of the underperforming school it replaced over 12 percentage points higher on average
9073036 with the end of the olympics in beijing all eyes turned for a moment to london site of the upcoming 2012 summer olympics
9073037 a power hungry tyrant uses venezuelas oil supply to overthrow the government and turns the country into a war zone
9073038 at the end of the day you have to remind yourself its a damned video game
9073039 it is time the venezuelan people stop paying for the greed of foreign interests we will make them pay dearly for our oil from this day forward everybody pays
9073040 these are the some of the worst floods in generations and they present a huge challenge for governments and humanitarian organizations
9073041 the kosi river broke a dam in nepal and the waters breached mud embankments last week in indias bihar state
9073042 destroyed almost a quarter of a million homes affecting at least 1 4 million people
9073043 the government of india is moving huge quantities of food to the area but we need to complement these efforts
9073044 how many purges do i have to hold before i get some competent
9073045 with the end of the olympics in beijing all eyes turned for a moment to london site of the upcoming 2012 summer olympics
9073046 we wrote a letter to the security council saying that we are responsible for the acts of our employees or people but it doesnt mean that we did it in fact
9073047 first of all i mean you have to ask the americans and the british government why it is second of all you have to ask the families of the victims i think they were very greedy and they were trading with the blood of their sons and daughters because the negotiation with them was very terrible and it was very materialistic and it was very greedy
9073048 i dont think that that poor guy is behind that sophisticated operation
9073049 luckily he had landed in the roots of a tree
9073050 there has been a real lack of sunshine this year it has been the dullest since the early part of the 20th century we have only seen around 90 hours of sunshine the average for this time of year is 200
9073051 in the honest belief that he needed to protect his son
9073052 it is beyond question that by acting in the way he did mr khan killed mr brown unlawfully and whatever their differences mr brown lost his life that is a consequence for which mr khan must be punished
9073053 what became obvious as the evidence unfolded however is that from time to time despite denials both mr brown and his son ashley barker were involved in acts of racial aggression towards members of mr khans family
9073054 in arriving at our final conclusions on public interest immunity and the discretion to order disclosure it will be necessary to consider whether this is a legitimate requirement
9073055 todays judgment discloses the shocking fact that the foreign secretary failed to give any proper weight in secret submissions he made to the court to the abhorrence of torture when he purported to determine that it was in the public interest not to disclose the evidence of ill treatment to our client
9073056 the foreign secretary has balanced mr mohameds right to a fair trial with the strong us desire that this information not be disclosed
9073057 you can get a clean unused 9mm automatic for 1 500 a glock for a couple of grand and you can even make an order for a couple of mac 10s
9073058 or you can get a little sawn off for 150 theyre easy enough to get hold of youll find one in any poverty area every estate in london and its even easier in manchester where there are areas where the police dont go
9073059 people who use shotguns tend to be lower down the pecking order there is less use of sawn off or full length shotguns and if a criminal wants street cred he wants a self loading pistol a mac 10 or an uzi submachine gun
9073060 there has been an influx from eastern europe and particularly from poland and there are also a lot coming in from people who have served in afghanistan and iraq
9073061 in liverpool docks you can put in an order for 10 guns and some grenades and theyll say ok and two weeks later they will be there and they are straight goers
9073062 they are legally sold in germany and wont fire a bullet but they can be converted by removing the partially blocked barrel and replacing it with a rifled barrel
9073063 after other small alterations it can then fire 9mm bulleted ammunition the replacement barrel is longer than the original and is threaded so that it will accept a silencer which is commonly sold as part of the package
9073064 there are hundreds of these floating around and hundreds have been seized
9073065 they look the part as they are based on the russian military makarov pistol if you are a 20 year old drug dealer and you want a gun that is what you will get and it will cost about 1 000 to 1 500
9073066 about two years ago a supplier brought back hundreds of german made revolvers blank firing pistols which can be bought legally in germany they were then converted and new cylinders made they could then be sold for 700 to 800 when the supplier would have bought them for 60 and spent about 30 on converting them
9073067 someone will have a tool and there is always one guy in a posse willing to use it they will have one guy who doesnt give a fuck
9073068 everyone wants to be a gangster now mainly the kids you have five or six in a little crew and one of them will be carrying they want handguns shotguns are too big and bulky the sawn off doesnt look so good but use a machine gun and you get known as a heavy guy they have them just to be a chap on the street to pose some of them walk around all day with a 38 its 16 year olds at it and its getting like america silly as it sounds
9073069 whos using the guns the jamaican yardies value for life was so minimal that they thought nothing of killing people
9073070 we dont like them they have no moral code but its the russians and the polish and albanians around now they are bullies they want to take over the flesh business the russians are cold hearted fuckers what they have been doing is following the card boys who put cards advertising prostitutes in phone booths in central london and then taking the girls hostage armed if need be
9073071 and drug dealers are taking a policy decision to get youngsters to carry guns
9073072 you can hire a gun for a period and if the gun has already been used for a murder the going rate comes down
9073073 you can go to the former soviet union or countries with less stringent regulations than ours and although british customs have their successes many guns appear to be smuggled into the uk
9073074 all you get handed in are guns from boys who wanted to be gangsters and then got a job or someone whose mother found it in their bedroom if i had a gun i wouldnt take part because if i got pulled what would i say oh im just on my way to the amnesty also if it gets out that youve given in your tool people will think youre a wrong un
9073075 only silly people keep it in their homes normally you have a keeper a couple of miles away and some of them have been at it for 20 years its best to have an old fellow with no previous or a woman you keep the ammunition separate because youll get a much heavier sentence if you have them together
9073076 i went to the cemetery and said well boy i can put you to rest
9073077 i shed tears every day and i probably will till the day i die why do these people have to kill for nothing if they want to kill people why dont they join the army you dont ever think a shooting will happen in your life its all down to guns just guns
9073078 a gun used to be used as a mediator now everything is revolved with a gun its brought the heat on everyone before you would get a two years jail sentence now its a five its getting like the us now like the wire its like a prediction of what will happen here i think they all think theyre playing grand theft auto its madness out there
9073079 the hope that we may somehow return to the state of affairs before 2003 is an illusion
9073080 at lambeth there was talk of building bridges but as far as i know there has been no approach made
9073081 the communique is on the right track it is not a schism they have no intention of leaving it is the reverse to provide a way for people to stay they are trying to get the americans to have a mechanism to stay within the anglican communion
9073082 we need to concentrate efforts to slash carbon emissions and become more energy efficient in order to prevent dangerous climate change but we also need to prepare for how our climate is expected to change in the future the strategy outlines in detail the range of weather conditions facing london which could both seriously threaten our quality of life particularly that of the most vulnerable people and endanger our pre eminence as one of the worlds leading cities
9073083 london is not unique all major cities such as new york and tokyo are at risk from climate change
9073084 it is essential that the capital prepares for the impacts of climate change which is already affecting londoners through increased flood risk heavier and more frequent downpours and extreme heat
9073085 the mayor must provide a comprehensive action plan for reducing emissions that includes ways to make it cheaper and easier for londoners to go green
9073086 if we are going to conserve them we need to know more about them where they live what causes the nests to die
9073087 the last few years have been really bad for bumblebees we think its probably the weather but we dont know we need to know how many nests there are we need to find the nests to know how long they live and what destroys them
9073088 bumblebees are very important to the environment as pollinators of crops and flowers but sadly they are struggling to survive in the modern world of habitat loss pesticides and intensive agriculture
9073089 further decline in bumblebees could result in a downward cycle of poorer harvests and sweeping changes to the countryside as wild flowers set less seed and disappear which in turn could have catastrophic effects for other wildlife

9073123 the university of california applauds the legislatures passage of this legislation which provides new tools to law enforcement in the investigation and prosecution of crimes against academic researchers and their families
9073124 the legislature led by assemblymember mullin has taken an important step in supporting university research that aims to enhance the health and well being of people throughout california and around the world
9073125 this is a very very important bill that will protect our researchers not just at ucla but throughout
9073126 its an important statement that says their research is critically important to improving the quality of life as well as health care issues for all of us
9073127 this demonstrates the concern of the state legislature for the safety of university researchers we are very appreciative of their decision to enhance the efforts of ucla and the uc system to protect researchers and their family members

9073132 i am waiting to see what happens my daughter begins secondary school now and if she doesnt get good teachers and her grades drop ill have to find another school or pay for private tutoring these are the most difficult years
9073133 there will be 235 943 teachers working this year 32 070 of whom are teachers in training the exodus is 30 percent lower than last year with nearly 2 000 fewer teachers filing for retirement
9073134 that was sorely needed now we can also dedicate more time to studying
9073135 in addition we will now have more assistants who obviously dont replace teachers but do provide support for their work
9073136 can our primary secondary and prep schools properly educate children and adolescents and thus lay the foundation for the future as they are at present governed by misconceived criteria and practices that ignore elementary pedagogical and psychological principles and violate family rights
9073137 young student teachers whose training is lacking and incomplete and whose maturity level is far short of what it should be
9073138 television is a support for teachers it should not replace us

9073230 this is my appeal to the journalists in pakistan not to say good bye to our critical role in the development and democratic process no matter how uninterested the newspapers owners might be we must not let development become professional robbery and politics turn into a scripted event where spectacle overwhelms substance we must not blur our roles to become minor players in an unfolding drama we are attempting to critique reporters should not reduce themselves to being little more than reviewers

9073313 i am excited by john mccains choice of sarah palin as his vice presidential running mate sarah brings a wealth of experience to the campaign and will pose a formidable challenge to the democratic nominees
9073314 as governor of alaska sarah palin is in a position to help articulate an all encompassing long term energy strategy that will lower gas prices and create jobs while protecting the environment
9073315 sarah palin is a smart conservative women who represents change real change not the stale rhetoric coming from obama let the word go forth that the mccain palin team will fight for every vote in every state and i am confident we will be victorious in november
9073316 i look forward to next weeks republican convention in minnesota where john mccain sarah palin and the rest of our party will lay out our plan to defeat the recycled policies of the democrats this november please check my blog often throughout the convention as i will be posting breaking news and updates several times a day next week
9073317 he must hold firm to the sure word as taught so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to confute those who contradict it
9073318 john mccain has consistently not been a supporter of amtrak

9073326 people think were closed i put signs up at the corner that say yes were open they dont want to walk down the middle of the road
9073327 if people will come into our stores well sell enough to make rent or make money but we cant when we cant park people dont want to come downtown when the street looks like bombed out beirut
9073328 i think this coupled with the economy it hurts us but we see the light at the end of the tunnel
9073329 a lot of the businesses around the square their percentages are up over the last year so were thankful for that were thankful for all the loyal people
9073330 youve always got one first impression and we felt like it wasnt a good one
9073331 we still won that was the good thing you cant really complain about a win
9073332 i didnt think we were going to lose the game but we didnt put it away
9073333 and that was what we needed to do it seemed like that was the personality of that team for five weeks so were trying to make sure that this bunch is consistently good and they do finish
9073334 you just cant walk on to the field and assume the other team is going to let you win
9073335 in a year where hrc voters arent moving to obama picking a woman could peel away those voters this will be a very interesting election
9073336 biden will school palin on foreign policy in the vp debate but hell have to do so respectfully to avoid a backlash
9073337 his pick is the devout leader of a socialist petrodollar state
9073338 however palin has shown receptivity to gay and lesbian concerns about discrimination and as governor she vetoed legislation that would have barred alaska from granting state benefits to same sex couples
9073339 america may not know much about sarah palin but based on what our community has seen of her we know enough
9073340 the thing im most concerned about is growth slowing outside the u s
9073341 the slowdown in the u s is pretty well established but tech companies have been very positive by and large on growth outside the u s
9073342 about a third or even as much as 40 of overall tech sector revenue growth is currency translation and the dollar has recently strengthened
9073343 weve been lowering our forecasts as weve gone through the year not dramatically but it keeps trickling down a little bit
9073344 millions of hours of seminar room angst could have been saved
9073345 scorsese was a strange thin little man michael didnt at first take him seriously or approve of his lifestyle but later he came to recognise his intelligence and hold him in high regard
9073346 everything and more she was asked to do without any airs or graces
9073347 we spent two years filming all over the world with a russian crew and choreographer a lot of time was wasted waiting for visas and we had m15 and the kgb on our tails sniffing for defectors but the biggest issue was that both the russians and paramount wanted a two hour cinema release whereas michael always conceived of it as a five hour television mini series
9073348 the post production including the dubbing and synching was terrible and the version that was originally released was artistically a disaster
9073349 for reasons of national prestige the russians decided that a russian citizen emil loteanu should be credited as sole director and michael was demoted to associate producer what could we do to fight back we had run out of money and at that time i simply did not have the experience for such a complicated work
9073350 you can see a lot of new opera and feel that not enough reflection has been done about why this story particularly needs to be told in music
9073351 there is a fantastical comic playful quality in the varjak paw books and the characters are so strongly drawn that it allows me to be chameleon like and use different kinds of music in a narrative way
9073352 in the way that papageno and papagena have folk sing song popular music and its put next to sarastro singing incredible enlightenment masonic hymns
9073353 as soon as we started mining those heavily philosophical references the resonances went rather further than i anticipated
9073354 if we are going to engage a young operatic audience the themes of gang warfare couldnt be more apposite at the moment
9073355 what were seen to be very clear boundaries between musical theatre and opera are dissolving
9073356 near feudal tribal society into the first nation state in europe in the process doubling its size and population
9073357 when she was married to philip and living at court her snakes instilled fear in the men around her
9073358 i dont really want to get into daily progress reports of how it went but it was something that we decided to do last week
9073359 were going to just keep progressing this weekend and going through next week and hopefully we can just keep feeling better
9073360 it was good to get back there doing the same things the rest of the guys were doing having to do rehab having to miss practice its not really the situation that you want to be in
9073361 so it was good to get back out there get in uniform be around the guys and hopefully that can be the sort of the norm from here on out
9073362 we are pleased to now be able to move on we look forward to an exciting future of nba basketball in oklahoma city
9073363 its very cool to have our team running so well to be on top of our game and its really fun to have somebody like kyle thats so fast
9073364 there have been a couple of races where its like either me or him and i think that brings out the best in a lot of people
9073365 for us its been a lot of fun like i said if it comes down to just him and i for the championship that would be fine but i have a feeling some of these other guys are gonna have something to say about that
9073366 there was no indication on the putting green when i was warming up that was going to tell me it was going to be like that
9073367 it just felt normal just one of those days where i made about a 15 footer on the first hole another on the second hole i just kind of built on that momentum
9073368 i just tried to keep the pedal down because i knew the scores were pretty low
9073369 its been kind of my goal the last moth or so to get off to better starts in tournaments
9073370 it seems like ive been having to come from behind ive just put it in my to try to get off to a better start obviously this was way exceeding my expectations
9073371 theyre not better than our defense he said of the cavaliers this week
9073372 weve got the best defense im ever going to play against their defense is nothing compared to ours
9073373 its one of the better teams in the nation it has been for quite some time sintim said
9073374 its a great opportunity for our program to play a team of that caliber
9073375 i think everyone is going to be a little bit nervous left guard zak stair said
9073376 its the first game and for a lot of guys its going to be their first start
9073377 we know whoever its going to be theyre going to be ready ogletree said
9073378 we know theyre a solidly coached defense a very disciplined group
9073379 were a new team were trying to put our stamp on the usc tradition well find out a lot about ourselves on saturday
9073380 i really feel like were ready for any blitz situation they throw at us he said
9073381 if we can handle this situation we can handle anything the only way you become the best is to play the best i believe i hope were going to do special things
9073382 i say this in the context of looking at the situation we are in right now at war
9073383 what is it exactly that the vp does every day

9073385 unites the gop gives conservatives a stake in the election and puts a real reformer on the ticket
9073386 mccain has chosen to balance his ticket with a principled conservative governor palins life story is one of sticking to principle she is living proof that a person can take on the corrupt political establishment including corrupt leaders in her own party and achieve great things
9073387 theres an old expression in politics go along to get along not this time the selection of sarah palin is one big kick in the pants to the corrupt establishment in both parties
9073388 congratulations to john mccain for hearing and responding to conservatives conservatives the base of the party have been listless but now nearly all will work enthusiastically for the mccain palin ticket in fact this is the most enthusiastic conservatives have been since the era for ronald reagan
9073389 this is a grand slam home run conservatives feet havent touched the ground since this announcement

9073471 if you took a poll of reporters and legislators i expect her approval rating would be down in the teens or twenties

9073473 i think that most american teenagers will find it rather tame and sort of laughable the things that were once considered so controversial
9073474 i think his experience of adolescent alienation is pertinent but hes also an upper class white man whos going to a prep school
9073475 many of the people who first wrote about how he was such a universal voice for american teenagers came from that same class and had the power and prestige to write about him
9073476 and people who have different backgrounds may not have felt the same at the time and may not feel the same today

9073484 the reason this happens is that obamas plan as stated in his official campaign publications throws taxpayers directly into the 15 bracket as soon as they cross the 50 000 threshold making them fully liable for income tax on all of their taxable income
9073485 in this way the policy acts as a cliff suddenly slamming the taxpayer with a substantial tax bill and reducing his after tax income well below what it would have been if his income had never increased
9073486 usually any new tax benefit like the one obama is proposing includes a phase in
9073487 why obama does not include a phase in is not clear it seems that the obama campaign has not really thought through this issue since it is almost impossible that a plan like this would ever be implemented in its current form the plan he has outlined sounds good politically but is ultimately imprecise and illogical
9073488 there are other simpler ways obama could accomplish his goal of reducing the tax burden of low income seniors
9073489 he could increase the standard deduction for seniors to around 43 000 for couples and 46 500 for singles to achieve the same effect it would only change one line on the 1040 that handles the standard deduction and there would be no need for a complicated phase in

9073497 to be in there and to do it you just have to be confident and go with your instincts and do whatever feed back the kids are giving you to learn from them and yourself and you can do it
9073498 it shows how far along the choices that we have and im happy with that
9073499 im obviously a woman and it does matter to me that this is possible and it isnt that i would vote just because its a woman but it is possible and that to me is american
9073500 i think its a great pick for mccain i really hope that he does pull in a lot of the hillary type voters i think its a very smart move on their part and id love to see her in the white house
9073501 the biggest problem i have in washington is convincing my colleagues from urban areas about rural health and rural education and native american issues and the fact that we have more miles of highway they need a rural perspective
9073502 so she brings a breath of fresh air to this presidential race because she clearly understands montanas issues im really excited
9073503 i couldnt believe i was really seeing him he seems smaller than on t v when hes bigger than life but it was amazing and i was a little jittery but it was great and he did a great job speaking to us so very impressed
9073504 they were much firmer yesterday in the pro am than they were today so they must have softened it up a little bit the conditions are great theres no wind and the pins are very fair besides one or two pins the rest of them are pretty generous thats why youve got a lot of guys shooting low numbers
9073505 it played really nice the greens are in great shape
9073506 theyre rolling fast especially as the day goes on the golf course is in such perfect shape right now and the weather is so great that if you hit good shots youre going to get rewarded
9073507 the roughs not real penal right now so the fairways are playing nice and wide and guys are ripping it
9073508 the greens are perfect so if you can get your putter feeling good youre going to make a lot of putts out there
9073509 its kind of nice to be able to go out there and make some birdies make some putts get some reachable par 5s there are some good holes out there to play
9073510 its kind of fun knowing you have to go out there and make some birdies
9073511 the condition of the course is really good right now
9073512 it was really smooth in the morning and there was just no wind when theres no wind and you have softer greens it makes it a lot easier to play well
9073513 obviously youve got to drive the ball well and keep it in play first and foremost if you do that itll set up a lot of birdie opportunities if you can get those 10 15 footers to drop thats going to be the difference between winning and losing this week
9073514 i think i was just seeing it better and for whatever reason you know there was no indication on the putting green when i was warming up or whatever that was going to tell me it was going to be like that it just felt normal it looked easy after those first two
9073515 i just kind of built on that momentum and just kept doing the same thing just tried to keep the pedal down because i knew the scores were pretty low today
9073516 i told brennan little his caddy i said my low score on tour is 10 under
9073517 i wasnt thinking the number of 62 i was just thinking 10 under if i shoot 11 under that would be my lowest ever instead of concentrating on trying to lag it down there i wanted to concentrate on making that thing and i almost did
9073518 i managed by game well and scrambled well and dug it out
9073519 i had chances all the way in just seemed to be burning the edge
9073520 when i really look back at the week i was only two shots out of the playoff and i had some good looks at it coming in
9073521 i was kind of struggling with my game coming in here
9073522 i wasnt very confident with my game and it showed on the weekend i feel like i have a lot more confidence been playing a lot better been right there in the mix two of my last three tournaments canada and last week i feel like im playing good golf
9073523 its been kind of my goal the last month or so was to get off to better starts in tournaments
9073524 it seems like ive been coming from behind all the way even where i finished second at memorial i had 73 or 74 the first round and rallied back

9073529 there was no indication on the putting green when i was warming up that was going to tell me it was going to be like that
9073530 it just felt normal just one of those days where i made about a 15 footer on the first hole another on the second hole i just kind of built on that momentum
9073531 i just tried to keep the pedal down because i knew the scores were pretty low
9073532 its been kind of my goal the last moth or so to get off to better starts in tournaments
9073533 it seems like ive been having to come from behind ive just put it in my to try to get off to a better start obviously this was way exceeding my expectations
9073534 it was one of the rare days it did feel like that
9073535 but it was one of those days with my putter i hadnt had in a while so it was fun
9073536 i just dont feel any pressure out there at the moment
9073537 they are growing up so fast now i just feel like im going to miss out on so much if i dont at least get to spend the summer with them
9073538 all of them are at very impressionable ages that 13 to 17 age range is a time you really need both parents to be around
9073539 i dont spend a lot of time away from home not as much as i used to its an important time
9073540 for so many years my wife and i dragged the kids around in june july and august to the u s open the british open then the pga championship and that wasnt much of a summer holiday for them anytime they see my golf clubs they sort of associate them with my going away from them thats one of the reasons why i dont even play
9073541 i was really happy the way i played last week because really ive done no work at all
9073542 im putting one foot in front of the other today i played pretty well and then stumbled coming in but thats fine im happy with my lot in life
9073543 people always ask whos the nicest guy on tour and nick prices name always comes up
9073544 when i get all my ducks in a row i think ill win thats what ill do ive got to get them all together
9073545 winning is a priority you obviously want to win out here i need to put in more work if i think im going to win
9073546 im hoping i just pick up where i left off i think i will go through a few bumps a few humps and hollows before i get back to where i was
9073547 they told me before we teed off that he had won an award so i looked at him with a discerning eye i can see why he won it hes such a good kid a really really great kid the first tee is a wonderful program and this is a great event
9073548 no doubt we are re living our lives through these kids

9073551 i have customers tell me they want organic but then get all upset when they find one bug or blemish
9073552 but others like sweet corn do it is impractical and nearly impossible to keep sweet corn organically theres no way i could keep all the earworms off
9073553 the birds feel comfortable enough theyre laying eggs in our field
9073554 running into different crops in each row throws them off
9073555 our grandparents didnt have fertilizers and chemicals they mixed baking soda and water to keep bugs away
9073556 some people dont care they want a cheaper price and thats fine
9073557 we have two totally different products that appeal to two totally different markets
9073558 im on the farm bureau with a lot of the local farmers theres no bad blood or anything
9073559 for some its not worth it for us it was
9073560 we consider ourselves a free agent and feel whichever group we join if any will be in a very good position to win
9073561 it is different than any other tournament and different in a very positive way
9073562 this is the tournament at the beginning of the year i circle on my calendar that i want to peak for i want to do as well as i possibly can at the us open because there is added pressure for me the pressure is a synonym for opportunity i feel like if youre doing something without any pressure youre probably doing something a lot of people dont care about or youre doing something thats easy nothing im doing out there is easy
9073563 how many times are you going to see your player play no 1 in the world
9073564 she always had the ability to play through her nerves but it was painful to watch because you knew how nervous she was it was a huge barrier
9073565 when i was younger to beat a girl just one ranking higher than i was it took me like six months every time because i was like shes better ranked than me so shes better
9073566 i knew she had the potential to be top 60 in the world we tried to plant seeds and little by little she started to believe
9073567 i have a bachelors in mathematical sciences so im not lost i think
9073568 we need to concentrate efforts to slash carbon emissions and become more energy efficient in order to prevent dangerous climate change but we also need to prepare for how our climate is expected to change in the future the strategy outlines in detail the range of weather conditions facing london which could both seriously threaten our quality of life particularly that of the most vulnerable people and endanger our pre eminence as one of the worlds leading cities
9073569 london is not unique all major cities such as new york and tokyo are at risk from climate change
9073570 it is essential that the capital prepares for the impacts of climate change which is already affecting londoners through increased flood risk heavier and more frequent downpours and extreme heat

9073617 i like pink and black make a logo out of that
9073618 okay so lets start with the headline do you feel the tone is too conversational do you want to tell me in laymans terms the tone that youre going for are there any marketing collateral pieces youve seen that have a tone closer to what you want
9073619 okay i understand so help me make it better and let me know what specifically you dont like about it why dont we start at the intro paragraph
9073620 i know we didnt have a lot of background going into this but now that we have a first draft can you offer anymore information to help me get a better feel for what youre looking for

9073623 probing into other peoples secrets became a lifelong obsession she became a stalker of minds
9073624 it gave me the idea of giving artists from all different backgrounds the chance to come together and create an event where we not only exhibit but entertain
9073625 im trying to work in quite a scientific way to see the limits of perception to see how you can fool the brain
9073626 that led me into an enquiry into the connection between seeing and knowing and the ambiguity of perception

9073628 he has been sent into exile in effect alone with and among images of tom and his sister and fanny brawne and friends he has disappointed and who have disappointed him and now that more and more the small circumference of his outside present world is getting smaller and smaller like his window on the spanish steps and the lapping boat fountain and the noise of life in motion and now that rome itself looming in its timelessness and ruins feels like the afterlife and now that the very shape of his bedroom is taking on the shape and depth of a grave with the patterned roses on the ceiling emblemising what he will see there now that his confinement is nearly complete it is his mind that is all he has because his body within itself is disappearing
9073629 the surpassing presence the natural greatness that he has been in search of this whole journey
9073630 love seems to be part of what is killing him piecemeal part time
9073631 mortal words and immortal words bodies and their spirits all find their ways in time

9073641 its when you finish it and you sit back and read it as the first reader that it can sometimes sock you right between the eyes
9073642 just to get them there the only way i could write it was to make everyone a character its almost like how a director stages an opera
9073643 my sister had a lot of problems shall we say but one of them was that she didnt like women
9073644 thats where my incipient feminism came from there was no empathy for women in our house my granny hated my mother my mother and nora had a constant battle i was constantly belittled for being female and told that horrible things would happen to me because i was a girl
9073645 the only game im prepared to engage in very far is flirting theres a funny thing sexually between us right now for example im covered in make up and youre not youre sitting there pretending you cant see that my eyelids are a funny colour its how men and women behave there are always games and where there are games theres a whole richness of stones to look under

9073648 we have chosen to stay in a room all by ourselves chatting to ourselves and if were not barking mad were boring or megalomaniacs
9073649 because everyone expects them to be funny off stage as well

9073656 the type of music that me suppose to make is healing music to make people happy if you smoke ganja too much it can eat brain cells it so strong it can tear your head all about and you see tings you never want to see so if you put up something and its not righteous like how god want it you burn it down with fire and you cleanse it burn all the corruption and evil that you created in there
9073657 he doesnt drink doesnt smoke cigarettes or weed hes had laser treatment on his eyes and his hearings good hes become a lot more spiritual

9073661 what likely could happen is that prosecutors may have to dismiss a lot of cases that are pending
9073662 it could have ripples statewide until it gets sorted out until they improve the program or get the court of appeals to say fields ruling is wrong
9073663 lack of medical oversight and self correction were noted as criticisms of the program
9073664 dr iverson noted that the law enforcement phlebotomists failed to follow protocols which themselves were drafted without medical input
9073665 he outlined the serious risks of improper phlebotomy including damage to nerves infection and hematoma

9073763 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
9073764 washingtons been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
9073765 in that time hes said no to higher fuel efficiency standards for cars no to investments in renewable energy no to renewable fuels and today we import triple the amount of oil as the day that senator mccain took office
9073766 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
9073767 i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power
9073768 ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america
9073769 ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars
9073770 and ill invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
9073771 both candidates are talking about energy high prices and global warming so its important to look past the rhetoric and see what is at the heart of their plans
9073772 as this scorecard illustrates the contrast in this election could not be starker
9073773 barack obama wants to give tax relief and 1 000 energy rebates to working families while john mccain wants billions more in tax breaks for oil companies making more than 1 000 a second in profits
9073774 thats why i came here tonight to tell you why i feel so strongly that we must seize this opportunity to elect barack obama president of the united states of america
9073775 we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving it

9073778 many scientists predict shockingly that the entire north polar ice cap may be completely gone during summer months during the first term of the next president
9073779 sea levels are rising fires are raging storms are stronger military experts warn us our national security is threatened by massive waves of climate refugees destabilizing countries around the world and scientists tell us the very web of life is endangered by unprecedented extinctions
9073780 in spite of john mccains past record of open mindedness and leadership on the climate crisis he has now apparently allowed his party to browbeat him into abandoning his support of mandatory caps on global warming pollution
9073781 the carbon fuels industry big oil and coal have a 50 year lease on the republican party and they are drilling it for everything its worth
9073782 we dont want to build a giant factory that the market doesnt need or want
9073783 investors like to know what tax policies apply when they are putting millions of dollars down on a project theres a pretty clear history that these projects are less likely to go forward without a credit

9073788 peru is the least explored part of the region because of the political pendulum that has hurt us unlike colombia or brazil our country has missed out on the opportunity to attract investment
9073789 according to convention 169 the indigenous peoples pre date the conformation of the government and as such they should be consulted but here the opposite occurs undermining our consecrated rights
9073790 if we dont make an effort to find out the extent of perus fossil fuel potential future generations will judge us asking why we didnt take advantage of this opportunity when petroleum was the star in the global economy

9073820 while psp has been crying out for dual analogue stick support weve been banging on about it for ages on this very site this solution seems piecemeal at best are you really going to whip out your dualshock 3 and attach a psp like some kind of teetering electronic top hat
9073821 the separation distance between the dualshock and psp is deceptively large requiring some kind of rigid usb connection ladder to hold things in place well that or a flexible cable creating a new problem youd need to mount the psp screen to keep it stable it would make sense for playing psp 3000 games on tv mind not through the lcd screen officially weve heard nothing so best to file this under the same category as the break apart wii style dualshock pad rumoured to appear at e3

9073929 bwss key windward sources such as punalu u and waihe e are showing signs of stress and pumpage must be reduced to ensure the long term health and sustainability of these critical water resources
9073930 power control is key to the mobile and network success if the ue requires too much downlink power then the base station or node b can run out of transmitter power and this is what was happening as you get more ues on the cell the noise floor rises and the cell has to compensate by ramping up its power to the ues
9073931 if the ue power control algorithm is faulty then they will demand more power from the cell than is necessary and with multiple users this can cause the cell transmitter to run out of power the net result is that some ues will drop their call i have seen the dropped call graphs that correspond to the iphone launch and when the 2 0 2 firmware was released the increase in dropped calls
9073932 the power control issue will also have an effect on the data throughput because the higher the data rate the more power the node b transmitter requires to transmit if the ues have poor power control and are taking more power than is necessary then it will sap the networks ability to deliver high speed data
9073933 this is one of the reasons why at amp t has been sending text messages to users to persuade them to upgrade to the 2 0 2 software in a mixed environment where users are running 2 0 2 0 1 and 2 0 2 the power control problems of 2 0 and 2 0 1 will affect the 2 0 2 users
9073934 it is not the network that is fault but the interaction of the bad power control algorithm in 2 0 and 2 0 1 software and the network that is at fault the sooner everybody is running 2 0 2 software the better things will be having seen the graphs the 2 0 2 software has already started to make difference

9073985 the program was designed to supplement the reserve component readiness mission and to add another resource that they could tap into to have these services done so they could satisfy their deployment requirements
9073986 it is also a tool for the service components to increase their individual medical readiness and to make sure they have a staff that is ready to deploy at any time
9073987 these services are delivered through two channels services can be provided in clinics where we will send that servicemember within 50 miles of a designated work or home location and they will go into an actual provider in their local area
9073988 we can actually send teams out to a particular location to do a servicemembers readiness program or a group event where we will send a team out that is customized depending on the services particular units require
9073989 were now able to either plus up that team or minimize that team depending on how many servicemembers actually need to be serviced during that time
9073990 we can send a team out that services 30 servicemembers or we can send a team out that services 100 plus servicemembers
9073991 we were also able to add some flexibility into the rhrp program that reduced the minimums required for scheduling services

9074008 it was a good toss to win there was something in the wicket for the spinners and they got a lot of turn even the pacers did well
9074009 the toss proved crucial it put the indians in an advantageous position but i should say we made too many mistake along the way there was lack of consistent partnership from the batters and that did not help the team at all

9074041 its been like trying to change from roger federer to tiger woods overnight
9074042 nobody has ever attempted to kayak to the pole before in fact it would have been impossible last year because it was frozen over
9074043 its a very long way across an ocean that is so cold and with high winds recently when i was up there training i was wearing a wet suit and a dry suit and i was still freezing cold
9074044 the stress of the 20 minute swimming at the north pole was extreme
9074045 but he knew it was 20 minutes and then it was over the stress here is less for every session but he is going to have two or three weeks of paddling and thats going to be very very demanding
9074046 theres one side of me that desperately wants to get to the north pole to be able to shake the lapels of world leaders to get them to understand what has happened there
9074047 its a plate of haggis with a plastic knife and fork and everybody who has entered sits down at the big table
9074048 its quite difficult because its plastic knives and forks and the plastic sometimes breaks
9074049 by giving them techniques to manage their own behaviour we can give them robust practical solutions rather than punitive ones it takes sophisticated thinking
9074050 were saying to these children you have a chemical and neurological challenge and need some techniques to manage yourself better
9074051 it is not an argument for absolving kids from responsibility but equipping them to take responsibility with techniques to balance their emotions
9074052 the fantasy of politicians is that the public is not intelligent enough to hear this i disagree once you explain it to them the public is deeply appreciative because it makes sense
9074053 where do these kids learn that life is so worthless they learn it as they grow up and see no one comes to save them from abuse and neglect
9074054 life should mean life you go to prison and you dont come out
9074055 on one level i agree with her because the message has to get out that human life is precious and no one has the right to take it away
9074056 but also the message should be that because human life is precious it should be protected against abuse
9074057 unfortunately it is cowardice on the part of the government they feel they will not win an election unless they pander to the popular belief that these kids are evil they feel theyre going to win votes on it
9074058 we have long recognised that early intervention is critical in breaking the cycle of abuse neglect poverty and violence
9074059 this is why over the past decade weve focused on developing integrated services for families from disadvantaged backgrounds and those who may need additional support

9074067 we didnt go into the game with the intention of rotating quarterbacks but we werent getting the ball to the receivers
9074068 at the same time we were facing quite a pass rush from their defensive line
9074069 we dont know who will be our starter at this point but wed like to have one in place by the time league play begins all three are capable kids
9074070 each one has a different style and different footwork which makes it harder on our offensive line
9074071 so if we can pick one it will be better
9074072 all these guys are starting fresh so it will take them time to get everything down
9074073 i was glad i was able to touch the end zone in an nfl stadium because rarely does any high school team get to play in an nfl stadium so that was cool
9074074 one of my best assets is being able to scramble and keep the play alive but if i dont stay at quarterback i will contribute somewhere else
9074075 it was a very tight game a low scoring battle i was impressed with brophys defense they may have six division i kids but the biggest thing is we got experience because most of our kids on offense didnt play a lot of football last year

9074079 after two months in deadlock it is unconscionable for legislative republicans to hold the state budget hostage without ever having produced a counter proposal legislative republicans have an obligation to this state to produce an alternative i think were all wondering when theyre going to level with california and explain why after months and months they have not shared with the public a single complete budget proposal californias teachers students and their parents police officers firefighters seniors and kids without health insurance need to hear what cuts republican legislators have in mind for them legislative democrats and our republican governor have produced fair bi partisan and responsible budget proposals based on gut wrenching compromises we have taken a common ground common sense approach that includes a mix of responsible cuts new revenues and no borrowing while still including key reforms including larger reserves and a rainy day fund it is well past time for my legislative republican colleagues to bring forth a plan for consideration

9074114 there were no good picks for mccain in that world why not take a risk

9074160 preparation for bad weather has been at the top of mind and we prepare for it all year
9074161 i scored two goals in four games but i want to score four in four games
9074162 i dont want to stop but with carlos up here hopefully he can bang some in too and we can get some wins
9074163 weve been struggling a bit as far as getting results and getting points and we didnt get three but we got one and thats a good starting point for us going forward
9074164 in my two and a half years in this league i think every game ive started jesse has as well
9074165 we have a good relationship its tough when you take out one of the links of the team that has been there since the beginning but it happens to everybody
9074166 its going to be interesting all night long says the bearlike kinch forking something into his mouth from a silver mixing bowl that definitely isnt on the menu
9074167 so mollify them kinch says referring to the unhappy couple
9074168 youre not going to see me with a pot and pan thats not how it works
9074169 a large part of our appeal he says of manresa
9074170 he was constantly on the phone checking in she says
9074171 we still have a lot of work to do he says
9074172 i just dont feel completely comfortable with the food im looking for something thats a complete reflection of us and of the garden its still not quite there yet
9074173 i like to have three things on the plate he explains
9074174 thats what youre paying for in fine dining restaurants the quality of the carrots the best veal the freshest john dory
9074175 i remember being in awe of the cooks he says
9074176 they were these loud profane guys who were almost like pirates working with open flames from the first day i knew i loved it and i didnt ever want to leave it
9074177 at 15 all wynton could talk about was being a trumpet player and all i could talk about was being a cook kinch says
9074178 a lot of my friends laughed and thought that was crazy but wynton listened to me and he understood
9074179 i wanted to be the best and it was all right there
9074180 it was just this roasted pigeon with a little braised lettuce and braised peas not any of this fancy french stuff he says
9074181 i wanted to do what chapel was doing but i had absolutely no idea what it was
9074182 i wanted to create a great american restaurant he says
9074183 all the flaws all the brilliance all the quirks of his personality and he also wanted it to mirror the character of its setting
9074184 you go to the farmers markets and you see every chef in town buying the same swiss chard and peaches and carrots he says
9074185 its great stuff but how do we set ourselves apart the answers obvious you have to grow it yourself
9074186 as if we had held a mirror up to the garden and it showed an edible reflection he says
9074187 he can use every stage of the plants life here sandberg says
9074188 i mean sunflower shoots that are an inch tall i dont care which farmers market you go to youre not going to find that
9074189 champagned for many top chefs this is a kind of curtain call a chance to soak up the admiration of diners who come from as far as singapore and saudi arabia as supplicants
9074190 but its good to let them know youre there he says
9074191 i dont know what the extra five laps are for
9074192 what the heck they nascar dont get it they messed up the winston the all star race and theyre messing up the shootout
9074193 they ought to line us up make us run 10 laps they want us to run around there for 25 first and have a 25 lap segment thatd be cool but 10 laps to go all or nothing thats what the fans want thats what the drivers want
9074194 the last segment being 50 laps were just going to sit there for 30 i just dont get it they dont get it i dont understand i dont know what the focus group is theyre talking to to get these formats
9074195 its frustrating because i want to like running those races i dont want to dread them but right now im dreading running them because the formats are no fun
9074196 when we went in it was nine to three for not guilty by lunch there was only one juror who thought he was guilty
9074197 what happened to the other people who were supposed to be there
9074198 who are we to decide what men in war are doing my father was a military man in belgium who went through world war ii fighting the germans he understands
9074199 i was actually looking for something from the government to sway me the other way
9074200 we had no idea about what happened before the trigger was pulled we didnt get to hear the whole story
9074201 send the military the message it is not above the law
9074202 who did everything right and still got his ass kicked
9074203 hes rubbing how rich he is in our faces does anyone doubt that obamas people meaning again the press wouldnt be running that soundbite every 30 seconds for the next week
9074204 a phone is only as good as the network its on
9074205 so much for a new way of doing business at the old at amp t your fathers phone company
9074206 if consumers are not getting the full 3g experience that is not apples fault
9074207 its hard to launch an iconic device like the iphone on a network that it is not yet fully deployed
9074208 as they build these networks they will need to make more improvements or the complaints will persist
9074209 both companies are accustomed to controlling all aspects of the delivery of its products
9074210 it illustrates the culture clash when you create an environment where you share the responsibilities between them then you have problems
9074211 bring out your poor bring out your downtrodden and we will help you
9074212 recruit an army of new teachers and pay them higher salaries and give them more support
9074213 i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaida and the taliban in afghanistan
9074214 we can call it quits and withdraw from iraq i think that would be a gigantic mistake or we can set a deadline for pulling out which i fear will only encourage our enemies to wait us out equally a mistake
9074215 i think he obama can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
9074216 would i make a blanket commitment to meet unconditionally with the leaders of each of those countries within the first year i was president absolutely positively no
9074217 on wednesday hundreds of people lined up outside the plant to apply for jobs as news of the raid spread a billboard had gone up last week before the raid saying the company was hiring

9074219 all them mexicans got fired because they didnt have a pass all these businesses have been taking americans jobs
9074220 how much money does it save us what are the limitations im going in with an open mind but any time the state is willing to give us 50 or 60 percent in reimbursement money you have to take a hard look at it you never know when that money is no longer going to be there
9074221 it is my understanding that any money that we expend toward the feasibility study will be reimbursed by the state in 15 days
9074222 but in order for us to proceed they want us to commit our resources to the study
9074223 if a new high school frees up space maybe we can use a facility like the greenmont avenue elementary school or the parker avenue elementary school and use that building for a town hall its been done in billerica and chelmsford
9074224 its in the back of my mind and it doesnt cost anything to sit down and talk about it
9074225 im hoping that we can all get on the same page and come up with something that appeals to the town
9074226 its obvious when you look at the enrollments that were going to need something whether its a new building or an extension we have to keep all our options open

9074240 i think hes going to have to play with some soreness
9074241 thats going to be a battle i think thats a very close battle
9074242 hes been a great part of this offense but were just evaluating and i thought stephon came in and did a pretty job
9074243 needs to continue to mature mentally in the passing game
9074244 thats the history of this offense basically is the passing game has been behind the run game the defense the special teams
9074245 and then as it comes on then you start hitting on all cylinders

9074307 they have like 16 guys that transferred from football bowl subdivision teams
9074308 its not the kind of team you think ok this is i aa its a team we should beat this is a team that has the potential to beat a lot of people
9074309 they can look at the tape and see that theyre a good football team
9074310 their quarterback was a no 1 pick last year and obviously there are people around him that helped him do that
9074311 theres a lot of guys on their team id like to have on my team
9074312 weve got the best defense im ever going to play against their defense is nothing compared to ours
9074313 its one of the better teams in the nation it has been for quite some time
9074314 its a great opportunity for our program to play a team of that caliber
9074315 i think everyone is going to be a little bit nervous

9074322 if you want to get to a 13th game you better take care of game 1
9074323 it will probably be the most hectic atmosphere weve ever been in
9074324 everyone tells me this is the venue that is maybe the toughest in the country to play i dont think we can simulate whats going to go on down there
9074325 our players understand that were in harms way in this game
9074326 weve tried when you get good its hard to get a game it really is i dont want to fly all over the country where our fans cant drive
9074327 this game scares me to death towson is going to be sky high to play navy
9074328 our players better not look ahead because if we dont come ready for towson we will lose
9074329 everyone involved with our program has been looking forward to this game ever since it was scheduled a couple years ago
9074330 this game presents a huge opportunity for towson football playing navy gives us the type of exposure we need so that people around maryland understand how far our program has advanced
9074331 schaefer is an impressive quarterback very smart very disciplined he knows where to go with the ball and can make all the throws
9074332 hes good at spreading the ball around to all his receivers he delivers the ball on time and with accuracy
9074333 i know they are going to try to ram the ball down our throats with no 36
9074334 we have to figure out a way to stop the fullback dive first and foremost
9074335 we spent considerable time during the spring and this august working against the option but its impossible to truly replicate what navy does they run that offense with such speed and precision
9074336 this is going to be a tremendous challenge for our defense
9074337 i felt like i had played well enough in camp
9074338 this could be my last year of football im not going to waste it
9074339 at this point i dont know if youll see two quarterbacks

9074351 though driving and text messaging should not be done we feel that this should be a regional response and the law should be enacted at the state level
9074352 although the city of scottsdale could pass an ordinance that would prohibit texting while driving it is staffs recommendation that the issue be addressed on a statewide level
9074353 never take away a persons dignity its worth everything to them and nothing to you
9074354 now this is not the end it is not even the beginning of the end but it is perhaps the end of the beginning
9074355 you know what youre going to have to do dont you
9074356 in my experience nice arent really very nice at all
9074357 they should change their name to the clinical unit for not treating the sick
9074358 si hay discrepancias las cosas deben decirse de frente cara a cara me parece que claudio a quien estimo mucho cometi un exabrupto al pedir que del solar no contin e y eso no est bien para ambos
9074359 no hay duda de que esta vez claudio se equivoc s que es un chico inteligente y va a recapacitar ojal las personas de su entorno le hagan ver su error
9074360 si del solar no lo volvi a convocar a la selecci n es porque fue consecuente con lo que dijo de no llamar a los indisciplinados y eso hay que respetarlo
9074361 es cierto que no est n los mejores jugadores en la selecci n pero no por ello le vamos a tener miedo a venezuela nadie niega que est mejorando futbol sticamente pero tampoco es favorito

9074363 governor palin is a tough executive who has demonstrated during her time in office that she is ready to be president
9074364 governor palin has the record of reform and bipartisanship that others can only speak of her experience in shaking up the status quo is exactly what is needed in washington today
9074365 who showed such determination and grace in her presidential campaign
9074366 the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9074367 inasmuch as marriage is the legal union of only one man and one woman no other legal union that is treated as marriage or the substantial equivalent thereof shall be valid or recognized
9074368 it is still far more likely percentage wise that a calamity wont strike new orleans than that one will but alas thats no reason not to evacuate whether today or tomorrow forecasting technology is such that a calamitous direct hit is always going to be unlikely at the time when prudent evacuation decisions must be made in major cities but the decisions still must be made
9074369 i just talked to my daughter who is in law school at tulane she is on her way to st louis because of the evacuation order and school is closed because of gustav but she said the locals down there are acting like its nothing to worry about the same attitudes before katrina hit they keep saying we only get hit by female hurricanes and we go years between hurricanes hitting the city fortunately they have a better governor this time though the same mayor
9074370 people now have more energy in their later years and realise there is nothing left in their marriage once they have had their career and the children have left home
9074371 people just cant afford to get divorced at the minute
9074372 it could be that husbands will think first before heading for the divorce courts at least until the economic landscape settles particularly as the housing market has been so badly affected in the last few months couples may think twice before divorcing and buying elsewhere
9074373 the reality is that couples split up in all economic climates as we have seen throughout our 70 year history families urgently need easy access to emotional support to manage the fallout from conflict when they separate
9074374 la disfunci n er ctil de como su nombre lo indica es el no poder tener una erecci n pero cabe aclarar que no se refiere a casos aislados u ocasionales sino a algo continuo no me gusta llamarla disfunci n pues eso significa que todo se centra en ese hecho y los hombres pueden hacer m s cosas
9074375 causada por enfermedades como la diabetes sobre todo avanzada porque los vasos sangu neos no se dilatan y no reciben suficiente flujo de sangre por lo tanto no puede haber una erecci n
9074376 existe medicamento pero el problema es que los hombres quieren una soluci n inmediata llegan y quieren una pastilla y ya muchas veces no est n bien diagnosticados y las dosis deber an ser distintas para cada paciente
9074377 otras ocasiones el hombre no necesita el producto y sin embargo lo toma siente que no sirven y entonces toma la pastilla esto le da la fortaleza y confianza pero a lo mejor no la necesitaba otros se la toman y esperan que la pastilla haga las cosas solitas
9074378 puede estar causado entre muchas otras cosas por la visi n que se tiene de s mismo como hombre ahora los hombres se fijan m s en tener un buen f sico verse bien por lo que toda esta necesidad de gustarle a alguien crea presi n y repercute en las relaciones
9074379 si eres hombre debes ser buen amante y si eres buen amante entonces eres hombre en ti recae la responsabilidad si eres aprehensivo y te lo crees seguro te va a pasar
9074380 quiero aclarar que hemos decidido participar en esta jornada de protesta con otras organizaciones representativas de la ciudad del cusco la polic a arremeti contra los estudiantes en u acto de provocaci n que se dio en la misma puerta de nuestra universidad

9074383 whatever can be done to have him come back to this country should be done
9074384 the afp has concluded its active inquiries although some long standing overseas inquiries are yet to be fully resolved
9074385 at the present time there is insufficient evidence to institute proceedings against dr haneef for any criminal offence
9074386 we are ready to negotiate the terms of any apology and a damages settlement with the government so as to avoid the unnecessary expense and further angst of civil litigation
9074387 he still loves australia but no decision has been made about whether hell come back to australia and if so when
9074388 it is hard to know with the afp they dont deal with things with a straight bat
9074389 so only time will tell but it would be comforting for him to know that the afp no longer regard him as a suspect in any wrongdoing in australia or elsewhere
9074390 the continued claims by mr keelty that dr haneef was a person of interest which is the police euphemism for a suspect has continued and exacerbated the damage to dr haneefs reputation that the unreasonable and unjustified actions of july 2 2007 had already caused
9074391 the long delayed admission by the afp that theres no basis for suggesting that dr haneef had committed any criminal offence must surely call into question mr keeltys tenure in his present position
9074392 it also heightens the need for the clarke inquiry to be given royal commission powers and widened terms of reference so that the afps continued efforts over the last 13 months to destroy dr haneefs good name and reputation can also be investigated
9074393 whatever can be done to have him come back to this country should be done
9074394 but you couldnt blame him if he didnt want to risk it a second time
9074395 the last government owes both him and his country an apology it should come from john howard
9074396 it has left the whole family in darkness this episode just because of some i dont know some foolish mistakes from some person
9074397 i have always had a plan to come back to australia and i still believe i have this option open
9074398 its just a matter of convincing my family it is very hard its my wife and my mother and my mother in law
9074399 there is an enormous talent going to waste in our parliament
9074400 if he is going to stay it is the big job that he needs to do
9074401 everyone has realised that peter costello is by far and away the best performer in parliament and we are a better team with him

9074403 the heo systems outstanding performance and reliability is a true testament to the dedication skill and operational excellence of our entire sbirs team
9074404 we look forward to successfully executing the next steps necessary to making this critical national asset operational for the warfighter this year
9074405 our number one priority is delivering mission success for our customer
9074406 we take great pride that the heo system is providing superior detection and reporting capabilities for the warfighters and we look forward to further enhancing the sbirs mission with the launch of the first geosynchronous spacecraft next year
9074407 with its high quality sensor performance sbirs will provide substantial mission utility to the warfighter
9074408 we are confident that heo 1 will operate well throughout the trial period

9074410 we have been successful beyond my wildest dreams and were not done yet learning from mars about its secrets
9074411 we are still working to understand the properties and the history of the ice at our landing site on the northern plains of mars while the sun has begun to dip below the horizon we still have power to continue our observations and experiments and were hoping to see a gradual change in the martian weather in the next few weeks
9074412 its been gratifying to be able to share the excitement of our exploration with the public through the thousands upon thousands of images that our cameras have taken they have been available to the public on our web site as soon as they are received on earth

9074416 we found ourselves in an awkward situation when a country militarily invading and occupying our country then recognizing part of its territories is trying to create a sense of normalcy
9074417 it wasnt a georgian attack on tskhinvali that launched all of this
9074418 it was russian pressure over a long period of time and then shelling coming from south ossetians
9074419 was not a wise thing to do because as weve seen russia was prepared to launch a major invasion
9074420 today it is a fight between the civilized and the uncivilized worlds
9074421 to allow urgently needed humanitarian work to be carried out in the country
9074422 the prime ministers legal actions are an attempt to use the courts to interfere with the official oppositions freedom of political expression and thereby give his party an advantage over his principal political opponents
9074423 such an injection of legal action into our political debates were it to succeed would give the government party a political advantage over its opponents
9074424 after the current government is ousted we will propose a totally new political system with those corrupt guys prosecuted and we will have a clean and efficient political system
9074425 they want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out and do the coup again
9074426 with both crude and total oil product inventories running significantly lower than they were when either katrina or rita sidelined gulf oil production both oil and gasoline prices are more exposed to potential storm related supply disruptions than they were three years ago
9074427 a comparable hit to production could easily send gasoline prices to new record highs
9074428 prices are going to go up pretty soon youre going to see increases by five 10 15 cents a gallon
9074429 if we have a katrina type event youre talking about gas prices going up another 30 percent
9074430 the frequency of high grade storms class 3 to 5 hurricanes in the region has nearly doubled in recent years americas one and only source of production growth could be shut down again and the price impacts would be severe
9074431 these bowl shaped depressions reflect the former location of relatively pure glacier ice
9074432 this late stage snow could accumulate in depressions on the crater wall and in favorable microclimate settings melt to produce the observed gullies and fans
9074433 are exciting because they establish a spatial link between recent gullies and accumulation of glacier ice strengthening the case for surface melt water flow in the formation of gullies on mars
9074434 our ice breaking research vessel polarstern is currently on a scientific mission in the arctic ocean departing from iceland the route has taken the ship through the northwest passage into the canadian basin where geophysical and geological studies will be carried out along profiles into the makarov basin to study the tectonic history and submarine geology of the central arctic ocean in addition oceanographic as well as biological studies will be carried out polarstern will circumnavigate the whole arctic ocean and exit through the northeast passage
9074435 the polar regions especially the arctic are very sensitive indicators of climate change the uns intergovernmental panel on climate change has shown that these regions are highly vulnerable to rising temperatures and predicted that the arctic would be virtually ice free in the summer months by 2070 other scientists claim it could become ice free as early as 2040 latest satellite observations suggest that the arctic could be mainly ice free even earlier
9074436 at awi we place particular emphasis on studying arctic sea ice and along with in situ studies of sea ice thickness change satellite data have been used extensively not only for the regular observation of changes in the arctic and antarctic but also for optimising the operation of polarstern in regions covered by sea ice
9074437 we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
9074438 on november 4th we must stand up and say eight is enough
9074439 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
9074440 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
9074441 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
9074442 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time
9074443 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 per cent chance on change
9074444 when john mccain said we could just muddle through in afghanistan i argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists that actually attacked us on 9 11
9074445 you know john mccain likes to say he will follow osama bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
9074446 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe
9074447 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
9074448 doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
9074449 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000
9074450 john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them the same policies all over again
9074451 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man
9074452 if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
9074453 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
9074454 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
9074455 we cant just say if somebody masturbates 12 times a day thats wrong
9074456 if they take care of other things in their life if theyre physically and physiologically ok otherwise we cant really say that
9074457 sex addiction is a specious condition it does not exist
9074458 it has a moralistic quality to it and a quality of lack of responsibility
9074459 you cant just stop this cold turkey its really hard
9074460 my goal when i see people is to try and get them to progress as quickly as possible so i can move on and help other people
9074461 people who are having lots of great sex with people that they love and feel close to arent considered sex addicts and they dont need therapy
9074462 sorry i cant help you but here is my recommendation
9074463 when investigating this issue i found var adm bin detect pstn cards pl would not load the drivers for digium and overwrite zapata conf and zaptel conf you should try moving that script to a different location so that it does not overwrite zapata and zaptel conf you will also need to load the card modules manually

9074465 we are very pleased to see the five rapideye satellites successfully launched this important milestone allows us to complete the delivery of the overall information solution we are providing to rapideye in support of their demanding business plan our information solution demonstrates that lower cost small satellite technology can now be deployed operationally to support business plans that would otherwise not be economically viable
9074466 cluster allowed us to measure the gradient of the magnetic field and see how it was changing direction with time
9074467 we are beginning to realise just how many interactions can take place between the solar wind and the atmosphere
9074468 we can only predict these future changes if we understand the mechanisms involved
9074469 the simultaneous launch of five satellites is not without its challenges commissioning will be performed from both the rapideye ground station in brandenburg and the sstl mission control centre in guildford the five satellites will gradually disperse from each other following separation from the launch vehicle allowing three satellites to be tracked and operated from brandenburg with the remainder under the control of the guildford operators this method of operation offers the most efficient route to achieving the maximum amount of contact time per satellite during the early days of commissioning following launch as the satellites are gradually manoeuvred into position around the orbit during the commissioning phase the brandenburg ground station will assume full control over the constellation
9074470 sstl long ago established the benefits of small satellite constellations and launched the disaster monitoring constellation in 2002 paving the way for a new paradigm in remote sensing the launch of rapideye will fully realise the business potential of constellations the simultaneous build of five satellites is the largest mission so far in terms of maximising and managing production at sstls guildford facilities expert in house engineering and project management teams worked closely with mda streamlining the design build and test of all five satellite platforms
9074471 were proud to be part of this cutting edge technology that will ultimately change the way we view earth
9074472 our goal is 100 percent mission success and providing the best quality product to our customers the bonus with geoeye 1 is the knowledge that we are helping scientists monitor and take care of our planet and natural resources
9074473 banks are charging a hefty premium to meet the requirements and this translates to about rs 60 per ten gram of the gold at the current exchange rate said monal thakkar of amrapali industries a leading bullion firm in the city
9074474 premium has increased due to short supply in the international markets besides banks have to bear various costs for safe custody of the gold said h c pattnaik chief general manager gujarat state bank of india one of the leading bullion banks
9074475 very nice but it would be better if we could understand it
9074476 whether jazz or otherwise music is a part of me it is a part of everyone an essential part of us all to me music is something fine and beautiful i think we should all recognise the value of music in all its forms since all types of music have their place and time and respond to different kinds of emotions
9074477 its a matter of what the attacker can get to and in what order
9074478 if you spend time patching vulnerabilities the attacker cant get to first youve left your network exposed longer
9074479 instead of patching or fixing or blocking a thousand hosts we could say there are 10 critical hosts and patch those first
9074480 i got a feelin the xxxs are going to the superbowl
9074481 i talked to her and she nodded over and over and over again she wanted to leave
9074482 no athlete would like to have a life with only their eyes talking
9074483 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
9074484 with bravery and distinction and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect
9074485 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time
9074486 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe
9074487 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation
9074488 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
9074489 what i will not do is suggest that the senator takes his positions for political purposes because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
9074490 they are all very excited i havent been able to speak to any of our remote staff but micky wunungmurra our chairman who is from the gapuwiyak community he was down in melbourne with me and he was very excited and i am sure he will take the message back
9074491 conservative star with the talent energy and family support necessary to carry out common sense policies
9074492 a fine person her lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling
9074493 we knew through early testing he would face special challenges and we feel privileged that god would entrust us with this gift and allow us unspeakable joy as he entered our lives
9074494 we have faith that every baby is created for good purpose and has potential to make this world a better place we are truly blessed
9074495 there was a temptation to bring on a midfielder i have to say
9074496 but sometimes as a coach you just have a gut feeling and you just feel we could really demolish this backline if we throw another striker in the mix
9074497 sometimes it works sometimes it doesnt tonight it worked really well
9074498 i havent done much in the last three weeks so you can imagine what i can do when im 100 per cent fit
9074499 no it was good to come back and be part of the squad again i wasnt expecting to come on so early we just combined well up front
9074500 it was a real poor decision from the keeper to play the ball in that area and you got duly punished
9074501 a number of the goals which was a reflection of how we played were from our mistakes
9074502 there is no point being the treasurer of nsw if people arent prepared to make the difficult decisions around public sector reform
9074503 i will not be treasurer if the mini budget in november does not return the states credit rating to a sustainable path
9074504 im viewing this as if ive got a contract with the taxpayers of nsw
9074505 we had to work hard this week on our mental approach
9074506 i can talk it all i want but the players have got to action it and they did i think the start of our game tonight won the game for us ad it was a credit to them how they bounced out of the blocks
9074507 theyre a tough bunch of blokes im very proud to be involved with these blokes at the moment and were going on a little journey here and were the masters of that destiny
9074508 i didnt think there was too much in it im pretty sure i hit his chest or ball first
9074509 realistically we should have won the game tonight were a semi final team were coming in the top three
9074510 tigers coach tim sheens has got a lot of troops there who are injured hes got a lot of people that are out we would have been very disappointed if wed come out and didnt win

9074521 i knew the longer the match would go the more tired he would get
9074522 i am concentrating on my own game and physically i am fine
9074523 it was a difficult match so i am happy to be through
9074524 players like that have nothing to lose so they start going for their shots
9074525 im trying to convince them but why would you have a movie screw up such a huge franchise not that i would make a bad movie so that would be cool to do a
9074526 if anyone would have the ear of activision it would be ratner who has weaved
9074527 if this were an organism it would be a symbiotic effect that we have through these different factors operating in concert with each other to achieve an overall more positive effect
9074528 we operate by with and through the iraqi forces throughout our operating environment
9074529 and so it is not us the coalition forces securing the iraqi population its the coalition forces in partnership with the iraqis securing the iraqi population
9074530 in the last year weve had more than 130 000 iraqis join the various forms of security forces
9074531 at the individual level the individual soldier or policeman understands what risks hes facing and he continues to serve and despite the risk continues to serve in support of his country and really in support and in defense of his family
9074532 at the national level there has been a significant demonstration of courage by the government of iraq willing to take on all of its enemies regardless of ethnicity or religious sect and that in itself has generated more confidence in the security forces and the government
9074533 its really a movement that does not have a national level consensus but its a local movement to provide local security for these communities
9074534 in doing so they took control of their communities back and of course theyve done so in partnership with us and more importantly within the past six months increasingly in a partnership with the iraqi security forces
9074535 in this society being able to defend your village and your home is a point of pride
9074536 because all of these previously unemployed military aged males are out there throughout the community earning a pretty good salary they now have disposable income
9074537 because they have disposable income everywhere you go throughout our operating environment youll see little businesses springing up
9074538 the security situation has enabled economic development where it could never take hold before and the same thing goes for development of governance from the local to the national level
9074539 we and our iraqi partners want to take full advantage of it and we are
9074540 instead of dwelling on specifics he laced the crowning speech of his long campaign with the type of rhetorical flourishes
9074541 john mccain may pay hundreds of dollars for his shoes but well all be paying for his flip flops
9074542 people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
9074543 who names their kid barack obama he must be weird

9074546 when we play against australia we are looking forward if we play good cricket it will be good experience for us i think

9074560 i think its discouraging when youre telling a 9 year old youre too good at something
9074561 the whole objective in life is to find something youre good at and stick with it id rather he spend all his time on the baseball field than idolizing someone standing on the street corner

9074565 one would expect bell and telus to want to be quite aggressive in being able to compete with rogers
9074566 so whats motivating it is wanting to lower the cost of acquiring handsets and accelerate the speed of getting the latest the coolest handsets
9074567 its still a question of how long it takes bell and telus to roll out a comparable network
9074568 so having high end devices is a key aspect of moving over to the new network but there are a lot of drawbacks to doing it
9074569 i think what is clear is that as it relates to 4g we will be going lte
9074570 the right is nothing if not filled with liars and hypocrites
9074571 we are obviously excited that this will be the first football homecoming at old dominion
9074572 by solidifying this date and opponent our campus community can now start the planning process for what is sure to be an historic day
9074573 i am pleased that we will now have an open date on oct
9074574 with three weeks of pre season practice an open date coming after the fourth regular season game allows for our players to have a break seven weeks into the football season after the open week we will have seven weeks of football to go
9074575 i just want to be nominated for an award for all the work ive done
9074576 despite their fantastic recent growth record investors need to be very cautious about emerging markets
9074577 the emerging market universe will split into the haves and have nots
9074578 because especially with the oil companies as far as the ones we get in here they just want to rent for right now theres been a few that have looked as far as buying but i dont think theres anything to rent in mohall right now
9074579 its porbably a good problem i mean youve got people moving in which is always good we just need to have some more homes to sell or rent
9074580 i dont know of another city thats had them right in town
9074581 its kind of interesting to look out your window and see an oil rig that close other than that i dont know that its done much else theres a few of the crew members that come in and eat at the cafe so its had that impact
9074582 its changed dramatically we have a lot of traffic in town main street is busy in a town where theres only 70 people and thats totally from the oil field north of town
9074583 weve got quite a few people coming because of that like theyve been just going out and bringing machinery or theyre just passing through because theyre going over there and they come and eat here which yeah its bringing quite a little bit of business
9074584 yeah of course everybody talks about it small towns dont have a lot to talk about so they gotta have something
9074585 i originally took six weeks off and at the end of six weeks i knew that i didnt really want to start work again this year
9074586 id always planned to leave gardeners world at the end of next year so i just thought ok ill bring it forward by a year i had become entrapped by it in a way that took me ages to realise
9074587 maybe third world countries will have to suffer as a result of our national food policy
9074588 we need to use our horticultural skills which are second to none in the world to grow food
9074589 its really important to get people aware of just how tenuous our food supply really is
9074590 for wealthy middle class people indulging in their penchant for peasant food
9074591 we dont value food in britain so therefore the cheaper it is the better it is we all eat far too much we all pay far too little for our food we have environmental problems we have health problems we have food transport problems
9074592 all one can do in the face of criticism is to say you are entitled to your view but these are things that need to be addressed the enemy or opponent we are taking on
9074593 by far the most dynamic age group growing food is the 28 to 38 year olds which is historically not a gardening age group i think that most people are aware that it takes so much oil and water to produce what theyre eating but the problem is inherent within the solution in so much as you dont want to tell people what to do but you do want to encourage enthuse and inform them
9074594 yes its on the cards due to being ill i put a stop to all work and officially i havent committed myself to anything but the danger is that by being on television you become part of the institution i like the idea of fifth columnists and subversion you dont stand on a podium with a loud hailer telling people what to do which the british absolutely hate youve got to somehow get under the skin of the system and make lots and lots of small changes
9074595 this terrifying disastrous evil has actually usurped and upset the whole system it makes you ask what were they doing right well they just bypassed they stepped aside theyre just not there you need to join together not delegate to a government body
9074596 my experience of working with government has not been fruitful i have to say im not aligned to any party although like many people i feel very disillusioned by the current government but dont feel very hopeful over any alternative power is not the right bit of kit to do this job its about going after the hearts and minds yes there will always be why should this wealthy tv wanker tell me what to do and its not a bad question why should i but i think youve just got to allow people to reject what you say
9074597 its an albatross organic is loaded with a sense of rightness with a set of rules i would much rather someone bought food that was local and sustainable but not organic than bought organic food that had to be shipped across the world weve got to move away from making people feel lesser because theyre not eating organic there is no doubt about it sustainable is a better expression for the same sorts of ideas than organic
9074598 you cant just say its bad because its bad plant breeding has been going on for millennia and its a gradual process at the moment i feel not nearly enough research is being done on the effects of gm and i have no faith at all in the goodwill of the producers and their motives but my overall feeling is that i would not discount anything
9074599 i do feel optimistic but i also feel that im 53 both my parents died in their sixties and youve got to leave this world in a better place that you find it youve got take the fuckers on and not just give in
9074600 we had already spent hundreds of pounds buying wine and expensive sparkling water so i was gobsmacked when the waiter refused to bring us a jug of tap water or even a glass he told us it wasnt the restaurants policy to serve tap water
9074601 i asked to speak to the manager and explained that we had bought plenty of drinks and wanted some normal water one member of the party needed to take medication and we did not consider asking for a jug of water unreasonable he flatly refused to let us have any reiterating that it was not the restaurants policy
9074602 water costs us the ice costs us the lemon costs us i have to charge
9074603 when i was in burger king recently i started coughing and asked for some tap water they refused even though i had tears running down my cheeks as i struggled to stop coughing they did offer to sell me a bottle of water however i decided to buy a coke instead as that was cheaper apparently they dont do tap water
9074604 as a country we have put 70bn into the water industry tap water in britain is now of the very highest quality and we urge restaurants to offer tap water to customers for free you shouldnt have to feel like a cheapskate because you ask for tap water
9074605 as a retired hotelier and restaurateur i was always led to believe that by law an innkeeper cannot refuse a traveller free water even if they do not spend any money at the establishment
9074606 there are a lot of misconceptions some of which arose out of the leah betts case in the wake of her death a lot of large premises had clauses put into their licensing agreements which obliged them to offer tap water free of charge
9074607 but apart from that restriction restaurants do not have to give you water and do not have to supply it for free
9074608 if a restaurant is on the public mains supply the water is potable and there is no reason for it not to be supplied on health and safety grounds
9074609 strada is pleased to provide tap water free of charge throughout its restaurants as part of standard service
9074610 at a time when we are facing such huge environmental challenges buying bottled water at the rate of 3bn bottles a year in the uk is clearly unsustainable i hope the hospitality industry will recognise their customers are environmentally aware and offer them free tap water without prejudice
9074611 we need to concentrate efforts to slash carbon emissions and become more energy efficient in order to prevent dangerous climate change but we also need to prepare for how our climate is expected to change in the future the strategy outlines in detail the range of weather conditions facing london which could both seriously threaten our quality of life particularly that of the most vulnerable people and endanger our pre eminence as one of the worlds leading cities
9074612 london is not unique all major cities such as new york and tokyo are at risk from climate change
9074613 it is essential that the capital prepares for the impacts of climate change which is already affecting londoners through increased flood risk heavier and more frequent downpours and extreme heat
9074614 the mayor must provide a comprehensive action plan for reducing emissions that includes ways to make it cheaper and easier for londoners to go green
9074615 if we are going to conserve them we need to know more about them where they live what causes the nests to die
9074616 the last few years have been really bad for bumblebees we think its probably the weather but we dont know we need to know how many nests there are we need to find the nests to know how long they live and what destroys them
9074617 bumblebees are very important to the environment as pollinators of crops and flowers but sadly they are struggling to survive in the modern world of habitat loss pesticides and intensive agriculture
9074618 further decline in bumblebees could result in a downward cycle of poorer harvests and sweeping changes to the countryside as wild flowers set less seed and disappear which in turn could have catastrophic effects for other wildlife
9074619 for wealthy middle class people indulging in their penchant for peasant food
9074620 organic is loaded with a sense of rightness with a set of rules weve got to move away from making people feel lesser because theyre not eating organic
9074621 there is no doubt about it that sustainable is a better expression for the same sorts of ideas than organic
9074622 by not counting the missing the government estimates not only result in inadequate compensation and rehabilitation processes but also underplay the need for rescue and relief
9074623 these places were far more organised than your average medieval town

9074639 what do you think is the most important legal issue facing the industry this year
9074640 this is a wonderful way for us to let the industry and our members know what were doing and how were investing their membership dollars
9074641 for a reputable nonprofit it seems like the smart professional thing to do
9074642 its important for us to communicate what were doing in a compact way and these are audited financials and an outside cpa has looked at our financials for 2007 and reported on them
9074643 we at fsc never want to take our members for granted we understand that trust and respect must be earned
9074644 what could be more respectful and trusting than letting our members know how we invest their membership dollars
9074645 would do the same if someone dared to attack us
9074646 every second of private time will be converted into the same number of credits
9074647 every token has also been converted into the same number of credits this change is designed to make our different show types easier to understand and to facilitate several new features and products we have planned for the future
9074648 we did our research before making any decisions and we were confident that the new credit system would have a positive affect on conversions especially among new customers but at the end of the day research is only research and results are what really matter
9074649 thats why we were elated when our expectations were reaffirmed by the boost in new signups that has continued to build ever since the credit system was launched

9074741 i realize that lunar real estate is not a hot button issue in washington but there is one great political merit to the authors proposed law it would contribute nothing to the budget deficit even if as the authors also suggest congress also offered a monetary prize for future settlements
9074742 the pick appeals to the hillary independent voter and forces obama to go easy since he doesnt want both a primary and general election in which liberal women thought he and his msnbc media henchmen took the sexist mean spirited low road given mccains 72 years women will realize that the role and future of this vp is no token appointment
9074743 i would add that obama does not need to be arguing how important experience is let me also add that when tim kaine who has exactly the same experience as palin was treated by the media and the dems as a serious and acceptable potential pick it opens up charges of a double standard
9074744 im not sure if palin makes sense politically but personally id rather see her leading the republican ticket than john mccain
9074745 well why not just answer no theyll look at you funny and wont know how to proceed if you attempt to explain why youre sunk just walk away
9074746 feminism is a socialist anti family political movement that encourages women to leave their husbands kill their children practice witchcraft destroy capitalism and become lesbians
9074747 a cage to stay behind bars until use and old age accept them and all chance of doing great deeds is gone beyond recall or desire
9074748 i believe in christianity as i believe the sun has risen not only because i see it but because by it i see everything else
9074749 it was a little bit difficult people didnt really know anything about squash they mixed up the vegetable and the sport
9074750 i have played squash all my life and in america the game has been historically limited to a select part of the population largely private clubs and private schools and elite universities
9074751 so i was really excited about the idea of expanding the population who play squash
9074752 so if it werent for city squash i definitely know i wouldnt have gone to boarding school
9074753 the program is really a life transformative program where we put much more energies into the academics then we do anything else
9074754 what we want more than anything is for them to graduate from the program believing that they can achieve anything in life
9074755 that they have the tools and the educational skills to be what ever they want to be
9074756 theyve changed so many kids life from people in the bronx me they have changed me theyve changed my friends
9074757 using the olympics to assert that tv is the preferred medium of consumers
9074758 partir cest mourir un peu mais mourir cest partir beaucoup
9074759 for the first time in years i am proud to be a republican
9074760 this is the biggest political gamble i have ever seen she is enormously exciting but if god forbid something happens can she be president
9074761 i told congress thanks but no thanks on that bridge to nowhere
9074762 we will continue to look for options for ketchikan to allow better access to the island
9074763 the concentration is not going to be on a 400 million bridge
9074764 maybe if we had done it right maybe some of that money would have gone to inspect those bridges and other bridges around the country
9074765 arctic sea ice has shrunk to the second smallest extent since satellite records began
9074766 outages you can understand but the outright loss of data they should be ashamed of themselves being the biggest computer company in the world
9074767 weve raided 69 companies today we have seized equipment including flatscreen tvs cd players set top boxes and mp3 players
9074768 effective august 26th 2008 licenses under those dvb t essential patents will be available from sisvel as an alternative to negotiate separate licenses with the individual patent owners
9074769 this is a huge story why isnt the main stream press covering it
9074770 there is an enormous talent going to waste in our parliament
9074771 if he is going to stay it is the big job that he needs to do
9074772 everyone has realised that peter costello is by far and away the best performer in parliament and we are a better team with him
9074773 i am sure we will find an accommodation for brendan
9074774 we only got wet for 4 minutes the whole trip
9074775 properly balance the way you water your crops in relation to the weather

9074782 we are very excited about this award aafes has very specific business requirements and we have had tremendous success in being a trusted partner to them
9074783 our team experience is unparalleled weve brought the best in the industry together to provide value added benefits to aafes together our broad experience extends to the construction of more than 100 military shopping centers and 250 big box retail stores
9074784 aafes mission is critical to the morale and welfare of our military and we along with our team members look forward to supporting them
9074785 even though it is john mccains 72nd birthday it looks like barack obama
9074786 americas working families want change they want leaders with a proven
9074787 governor palins lack of experience and thin record give us no choice but
9074788 thats why change to win members are so excited about the obama biden ticket were in our sixth month of backing a candidate who has the vision and leadership to make real change for all of americas working families obama had the wisdom to pick a partner with over 30 years of experience in foreign affairs and who has always stood on the side of workers in the fight for good jobs retirement with dignity and the opportunity to leave a better life for their children that is why we are proud and excited to continue to knock on thousands of doors visit thousands of worksites and make millions of phone calls to educate our members and turn out an historic vote this november
9074789 recently barack obama was asked when he thought life begins in reference to the issue of abortion obama responded by saying that decision was above his pay grade knowing that the next president may be able to appoint two or three u s supreme court justices who may be called to make rulings on the issue of abortion do you support or oppose a president who does not know when life begins
9074790 its sad that a man would run for president having considered the key questions that drive someone to become a christian
9074791 would you support or oppose a ballot measure in your state that stipulates only marriage between a man and a woman will be legally recognized
9074792 this bodes well for california and the people who are working on the ballot initiative in that state because our poll results show that 58 percent of the people nationally support such a ballot measure
9074793 until today gmg delaware has been content to await gmg new yorks funding of the deal and has not exercised its rights directly at this time however gmg delaware is not confident in gmg new yorks ability to finance the transaction gmg new york has denied gmg delaware any access to information concerning their alleged financing and the trustee has moved to terminate gmg new yorks rights to the acquisition
9074794 independent of gmg new york gmg delaware has obtained a solid funding commitment for the full purchase price and has shared its funding commitment with the trustee
9074795 we have every belief that gmg delaware can and will fund the acquisition if provided the opportunity by the trustee and with consent of the court and we feel that our original bid was misidentified in good faith we hope gmg new york raises the funds necessary to close the deal however in lieu of the trustees present position and without information from gmg new york gmg delaware has our own funds to close and are offering to purchase the assets for the same price if gmg new yorks rights are deemed terminated
9074796 gmg delaware is confident that it can complete the purchase and that its bid represents the best return to the creditors of the bankruptcy estate for the trustee
9074797 the 3 2 million members of the national education association are
9074798 while she is only in her second year as alaskas governor she has thus
9074799 in her less than two years as the states chief executive officer she
9074800 her selection however has certainly taken the issue of experience off the table for political debate
9074801 we wanted to provide our customers with the opportunity to respond to the storms potential impact to energy markets as quickly as possible
9074802 the ability to trade both our exchange listed and over the counter energy products during this period will be a significant benefit for global energy market participants
9074803 they were obsessed with legends and myths associated with archaeological sites pagan rituals and green men
9074804 and the idea of rural britain as a rather eccentric place they were also invariably enthusiastic about wherever it was they were writing about even if it wasnt especially thrilling
9074805 today weve got the likes of the rough guides which are only interested in places they regard as cool and thus dismiss swathes of britain as not worth visiting
9074806 peppered with barrows and haunted by many well authenticated ghosts including a pack of hounds
9074807 its there in our growing enthusiasm for local food and folklore and in strains of new age thinking
9074808 the shell vision also inspired a generation of childrens stories such as catweazle and stig of the dump and the idea that it was perfectly possible to meet a stone age man at the bottom of your garden
9074809 you could say the shell philosophy reached its ultimate expression in the film the wicker man
9074810 and the idea that villagers would welcome you into their homes and pubs and then burn you alive
9074811 rnrn has been in communication with the community free clinics that arose from the aftermath of katrina and we will be monitoring the situation all throughout the labor day weekend to see when and if the services of our rn volunteers are needed
9074812 in the meantime we will be screening rns as to their availability and expertise
9074813 katrina revealed some ugly truths about our nations failure to care for its citizens in the wake of a natural disaster and here we go again
9074814 and we are still not prepared today we need a national healthcare system that has the capability of stepping in at the time of impact and providing the healthcare services needed
9074815 was the center of the greater new orleans safety net system for the past 269 years and the dominant source of care for the indigent population serving 63 percent of the uninsured
9074816 after it exits cuba all bets are off intensification in the gulf to category 4 or 5 status is very much in the mix though if that happens it would probably then weaken somewhat before landfall
9074817 hey look ladies vote for me cuz i picked a girl
9074818 fue una carga de caballer a espectacular muy valiente sin duda pero nunca debi lanzarse los rusos contra cuyos ca ones atacaron frontalmente en un alarde de hero smo y estupidez los seiscientos y poco h sares dragones y lanceros brit nicos pensaron que aquellos tipos deb an estar borrachos de hecho pidieron a los que hicieron prisioneros que les echaran el aliento el nico control de alcoholemia de una carga a caballo que se conozca
9074819 hay una serie de errores militares garrafales y un despliegue de imbecilidad como pocas veces se ha visto en la historia de la guerra que ya es decir
9074820 eu roaming regulation was introduced so that europeans use their mobile phones without fear of excessive bills when travelling in the single market
9074821 to bring about a single market for roaming text messages and data services
9074822 the x360 pushes back the boundaries of form and function to deliver real style with substance
9074823 deployment of contactpoint will not begin in october 2008 as originally planned
9074824 identified some issues as a result of recent system tests which we are working urgently to address
9074825 we are working hard to iron out glitches before it goes out to users this is not about security issues
9074826 blaming dropdown menus is like considering whether a grenade is pink or green before handing it to a child
9074827 the government is going to expose the details of children and their parents to the country and dropdown menus are all it is worried about
9074828 this database shouldnt just be delayed it should be buried
9074829 instead of delaying the launch of the database this intrusive project must be scrapped altogether
9074830 a recent independent review has already undermined all of the governments assurances that the database will be secure
9074831 the discovery of further technical issues does not bode well for the future the government has proven itself untrustworthy with large databases containing sensitive data
9074832 people dont tend to be as active in switching energy suppliers when the economy is bad but our new dual fuel offering and an increase in marketing spend should help persuade more customers that we are an efficient option
9074833 home heat generation provides security in peoples energy supply as well as economy and were confident uptake will be strong
9074834 weve already seen a 50 per cent increase in hits on that section of our web site
9074835 there can be no patriotism without permanent opposition and criticism
9074836 people dont tend to be as active in switching energy suppliers when the economy is bad but our new dual fuel offering and an increase in marketing spend should help persuade more customers that we are an efficient option
9074837 home heat generation provides security in peoples energy supply as well as economy and were confident uptake will be strong
9074838 weve already seen a 50 per cent increase in hits on that section of our web site
9074839 strategic actions to accelerate growth in certain areas of our business affected gross margins this quarter and there will be some non linearity in the improvements in our operating income margins as we rebalance our portfolio make cost improvements and drive growth
9074840 we have our most competitive product portfolio ever whether for digital nomads or hyper scaled data centres
9074841 certainly organisations that have current arrangements for parcels that are already in the system some of those customers have requested that parcels be delivered back to them for them to organise freight themselves
9074842 the combination of fuel price increases and consumer spend dropping this summer was always going to leave at least one casualty
9074843 we dont envisage that all customers will be adversely affected amtrak was only one of our suppliers
9074844 i believe orders are going out today so customers should expect to receive them over the next few days
9074845 should you have any parcel collection or delivery requirements you may contact business post ltd which will be happy to provide an alternative service
9074846 there was a large amount and i know we have been working around the clock
9074847 but we havent taken over the customer base or anything like that
9074848 it is a business led by consumer demand and as consumer spending power has weakened amtraks business has suffered
9074849 we are currently assessing the financial situation of the business and as a result the collection and delivery of goods may be disrupted
9074850 it looks like the operating system that runs on domestic pcs so end users often think they can have a go
9074851 it is a laborious process having to map the hardware and run routines like the target analyser probe
9074852 microsofts embedded operating systems offer flexibility of configuration to suit individual applications which remains available to developers exercising the offer
9074853 with pc based devices used for all sorts of embedded or screen and keyboard free applications anything that takes the drudgery out of software setup has to be worthwhile
9074854 it gives those reselling and integrating an opportunity to focus on adding some real business value
9074855 we know that people want to be able to access the internet in its entirety wherever they are now were allowing them to do just that from a feature rich device with all of the styling people have come to expect from lg
9074856 we needed to update our system and make working at multiple sites easier for our team
9074857 staff are now happily free seating with their new telephone numbers from site to site
9074858 these projects are good for business good for the economy good for jobs and they help secure more self sufficient energy resources for our country
9074859 we also intend to provide developers with a useful dashboard and analytics to help drive their business and ultimately improve their offerings

9074868 having this first hand information will be welcome to our town
9074869 it is an interactive positive step towards better understanding and being better equipped and a real win win situation

9074871 visitors will also have the opportunity to obtain free cancer council booklets view interactive displays and use telephone and internet connectivity to access the cancer helpline and internet support forums
9074872 klaar met studeren dus lekker 4 maanden naar nieuw zeeland
9074873 26jaar een mooie kans om dit weblogje weer eens af te stoffen
9074874 de enige benen waar ik op kan staan zijn die van mij
9074875 i am thrilled to pave the way for california drivers to obtain insurance that is more environmentally friendly and more accurately reflects driving habits
9074876 whos out of control whose life is out of control give me a break
9074877 going from place to place being dragged around by samantha so she can make more money off of lindsay being there when she spins shes gone from making 7 million to less than a million a movie whos out of control
9074878 i go and help people in rehab thats control how can she say im out of control
9074879 i want lindsay to be in a good place when i started looking at what samantha was doing dragging lindsay to clubs drinking around lindsay samantha is one of the biggest problems in her life
9074880 thats what dina told me im reacting on what dina said but then dina steps out of the picture because she wants to look like the good guy
9074881 she wants to try to look good and stay on lindsays good side instead of being a good parent
9074882 when i first spoke out i clearly stated that everything i said and my concerns were generated by my ex wife dina after a recent phone call from lindsay while she was traveling on one of samanthas dj gigs i became very concerned
9074883 everything was arranged and agreed i have dozens of texts and recordings with dina to prove it but when the time came on sunday dina chose to go into nyc and have dinner with sam sams mother and lindsay rather than address real issues and make things better for lindsay
9074884 a day later dina told me that sam was writing a book that sam was a negative influence on lindsay and that sam needs to be out of lindsays life then she asked me how to do it
9074885 matters became worse when dina said lindsay was in real danger and she needed to save her and get lindsay into a place these are all dinas words tell me what father wouldnt be concerned and even pissed at sam after hearing this
9074886 to even imagine that dina would then go on vacation is even more sickening
9074887 dina cares please lindsay was once stalked by a guy name deleted who dina trusted and i said from the get go that i didnt only for dina to look the other way when i had to get a task force to track him down
9074888 dina took a percentage of lindsays money when i never took a red cent all the while i only speak out when something is wrong or needs to be made right
9074889 dina is a money loving fame seeking self serving deceiver who comes from roots of the same
9074890 while guilt may bring a response by some others like dina pass the buck and dont accept any responsibility at all
9074891 all i want is for lindsay to be healthy and in a good relationship i want her to use the gifts she has in the best ways and to help others i said it from the very beginning show me who you walk with and i will tell you who you are people may deceive us but our eyes and facts dont open your eyes
9074892 ive never taken or earned one penny from my daughter meanwhile all the people around her including her mother are earning money off of her
9074893 they want publicity theyre there for self serving reasons i didnt have my own reality tv show
9074894 ive met her she cant even look in my eye she knows i know what shes all about shes controlling
9074895 sooner or later her relationship with samantha will fall apart and im sure lindsay will come back someday and say
9074896 nc o noapte cu pendul ri ntre temeri insuficient conturate
9074897 half baked policies devoid of facts are not the answer to the serious issues of our times
9074898 for example ms rhiannon has called for a prohibition on mining in the murray darling basin while a water study is conducted
9074899 the mining industry fully supports a scientific evidence based approach to mining and mining exploration
9074900 but to close down mining in the meantime when such studies take several years could bring towns like orange parkes cobar and broken hill to their knees
9074901 lee rhiannon claims she is not anti mining but in the past eight weeks alone she has issued no less than 14 anti mining press releases to either close withhold water rights or investigate mining operations none with evidence
9074902 but when it comes to rural australia ms rhiannon truly wants to run with the foxes and hunt with the hounds
9074903 hers is the party that has ensured that many thousands of farmers can no longer operate on their farms without having to comply with the sort of land use regulations that would send coal companies to the wall
9074904 ms rhiannon may well be trying to erase memories of the zero that the greens party received on the report card issued by the nsw farmers association to the major political parties in the run up to the 2003 state election
9074905 the farmers found that the greens party had not backed farmers on a single one of the five significant bills in the previous three years
9074906 the community deserves better than simplistic solutions focussing on a sector which is the smallest nett user of water in the state
9074907 mining accounts for just over one per cent of the total water use in nsw compared to 70 per cent for agriculture and around 10 per cent for households
9074908 if the greens had a serious agenda about environmental sustainability they would promote the need for a sustainable balance between diverse regional industries such as agriculture mining tourism services and environmental management
9074909 i thought it was unfair to us and to him
9074910 its a very reasoned response from those jurors because they apparently recognized this was not something they were well suited to determine
9074911 in my view its going to cause the u s attorneys to give a second thought to prosecuting soldiers for acts that occurred in combat
9074912 how many jurors have been involved in a domestic dispute in which a person was killed none you dont put those people on a jury
9074913 i dont think any of us who passed that legislation thought we were now going to have people discharged from the military being charged in federal court
9074914 there are all kinds of problems with witnesses and evidence and those kinds of things in addition to the fact that military persons are operating in an environment quite different from the normal street crime we see
9074915 but its worth taking a closer look at whether civilian juries will ever have the confidence to believe they can sit in judgment in these cases
9074916 the average american is reluctant to second guess the conduct of a service person in a combat zone
9074917 coming to the knicks and hopefully being able to contribute means a lot to me
9074918 it has always been my dream to play for this team my goal is to show the coaches that i can play and do all that i can to help the team win some games
9074919 i am very happy my son will follow in my footsteps
9074920 hopefully he will have a long and productive career in new york i am proud of him and wish him nothing but success
9074921 patrick ewing will have an opportunity here to compete for a spot on our roster
9074922 he is a solid defensive player and a very good athlete
9074923 the president today declared an emergency exists in the state of louisiana and ordered federal aid to supplement state and local response efforts due to the emergency conditions resulting from gustav beginning on august 27 2008 and continuing
9074924 it is a high wire act theres no question about that
9074925 theres no question that obamas people are doing everything they can to turn it into a more intimate venue but there is only so much intimacy you can create
9074926 if anybody right now is the all american girl next door its shawn johnson
9074927 thats part of what the obama folks want to attach to obama he may be a different color but hes as all american as everyone else
9074928 on the night of nov 4 our friends will look back and realize this night this convention is one of the reasons we turned colorado blue
9074929 we are voting to reject and recommending yes to strike
9074930 this is the best we can do its our best and final offer
9074931 based on our discussions with the union we believe the proposal addresses most of the important issues
9074932 we think boeing has done much to avoid a strike which would be quite costly to both parties
9074933 from what i can see it does look like it should have a good chance of satisfying enough of the workers that it decreases the odds of a strike
9074934 not even the same organization it was three years ago
9074935 certainly louisiana stands a fair likelihood of experiencing the first serious hurricane since the hurricanes of 2005
9074936 not an occasion for panic but an occasion to put into practice all the preparation thats been done up until now
9074937 everything came out the word would be awesome from our standpoint
9074938 everything was clean there were a number of tests and josh came thought with flying colors obviously we hoped for that we needed to get some closure
9074939 i dont trust anybody more than i trust him when it comes to stuff like that just to go down there and hear it from him its something i needed to do just to clear my mind
9074940 he said my ligament looked fine thats what i was afraid of it was a big relief
9074941 i dont like to see anybody get hurt but thank you josh
9074942 to me hes one of the best pitchers if hes not the best pitcher in the game this guy is a big time big game pitcher
9074943 theyre going to miss him id rather face anybody else than face him hes one if the best ive ever seen
9074944 the fact is that us citizens were indeed in the area in conflict during the hostilities it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders
9074945 if my guess is right then it raises the suspicion that someone in the us specially created this conflict to worsen the situation and create an advantage in the competitive struggle for one of the candidates
9074946 i want him to stop hurting and talking to the media about the people i love
9074947 she has been responsible with her work shes been doing a great job however drinking and using isnt the only form of addiction and the relationship that lindsay has with samantha is toxic
9074948 i think sooner or later youre going to see lindsay right back up on top where she belongs and shes going to turn around and say dad you were right all along
9074949 she dated guys her whole life she has a relationship with sam and its a friendship because shes been hurt by so many guys in the past maybe she kind of walked away and found solace and companionship in a girl
9074950 i dont believe its anything more than a friendship they have
9074951 but thats between lindsay and god and samantha and god
9074952 if dina was on the right page and doing the right thing as a mother and didnt play two sides of the coin like she does then things would be much better for lindsay
9074953 she tells me one thing about sams relationship with lindsay and how opposed she is to it and even told me yesterday that sams writing a book and she tells me lindsay shouldnt be around samantha but in the meantime shes sitting having dinner with the ronsons
9074954 the man who is so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible
9074955 i am not the reason that he has no contact with his daughter he is
9074956 i am always will and always have been here for her for her not for anything else when does your book come out mr lohan
9074957 demand for broadband is rising at a time when relevant supply is actually shrinking elementary economics would suggest that greater pricing power is the inevitable outcome
9074958 if you look at leading countries in broadband a lot of them have shied away from data caps
9074959 in denmark for example they dont have data caps carriers are increasingly deploying fiber optics and they offer speeds that are faster than anything you can get in the u s
9074960 in a lot of countries carriers are taking an approach of abundance while in the u s theyre taking a scarcity approach
9074961 when youre talking about the network and how caps may affect the market i dont know that wed have a position on that
9074962 isps have to design services in a way that allows people to access legal content
9074963 i would like p4p to be part of comcasts plan i think its good for comcast and its good for comcast users
9074964 but with p4p you might not need to put a usage cap on subscribes and if comcast is going with usage caps p4p might not be part of the plan
9074965 we should all be proud of gov sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and sen mccain while their policies would take america in the wrong direction gov palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9074966 the top eleven things hillary clinton did upon hearing sarah palin got the veep nod
9074967 i have only endorsed one presidential candidate in my life and that was george bush in the second term after i had watched him for four years i did not do that in his first term so im very reluctant to do that you marry a politician you can be a widow pretty quickly
9074968 but i can tell you that if i had to go into the voting booth today i would pull that lever for mccain palin
9074969 you marry a politician you can be a widow pretty quickly
9074970 but i think his reaction is an excellent barometer of how evangelicals feel until now millions of them were indifferent to mccain and would have stayed home but now theyve got their own barack obama to be excited about and theyre going to turn out in droves
9074971 ah seria bacana fazer ter tal coisa como pod amos fazer isso
9074972 me ha disgustado ver a un gran campe n como l no estar entre los diez primeros en valencia respecto a ferrari puede estar tranquilo
9074973 estamos muy contentos de que pueda venir a los grizzlies es un p vot joven muy productivo en ataque y rebote
9074974 ser la inclusi n de una secci n dedicada a la segunda divisi n en este primer programa abordaremos el regreso del rayo vallecano tambi n queremos dar importancia a la opini n alkorta y sarabia nos contar n en sus apuntes lo que esperan de la jornada

9074979 id sit two days in the sun to be here
9074980 its tremendously exciting to be here what can i say were here at 11 oclock it doesnt start until 7 p m we want to be here have fun and be ready to cheer every moment
9074981 we need to remember that the vice president is a heartbeat away from the presidency its especially poignant today on sen mccains 72nd birthday
9074982 i think it is an insult to women that the mccain campaign would think that simply because he picked a woman as his running mate that women would suddenly vote for him
9074983 whats the insult is that diana degette still serves in office
9074984 diana degette and her ilk dont have anything in common with a successful governor of alaska who has fought hard to control government spending and to develop oil resources
9074985 i have never heard of her it is in my view still about what this election is all about that we cant have four more years of george bush
9074986 his selection of someone weve never heard of from alaska i dont think will change a thing for this election
9074987 joe biden could step into the presidency if something were to happen to barack obama
9074988 this storm has the potential for being a very dangerous storm
9074989 i do not want to speculate but i am fearful that we could be looking at a number in the region of 10 in terms of the number of people who have died
9074990 the water is rising fast and there is widespread looting down here
9074991 the people are even stripping the material from one of the bridges it is awful
9074992 if people give you a shelter you should take it
9074993 gustav could become a major hurricane near the time it crosses western cuba
9074994 weve taken in all the balcony furniture all the pool furniture the marquees tied up what needs to be tied up cut down any coconuts
9074995 we have no experience with this kind of a storm and after katrina there is no way we are staying
9074996 it does look like this will be a strong storm
9074997 we look forward to a better day even as we prepare for a threat to come
9074998 thats how high gas prices are im at the gate right now this is really happening proof gas prices are too high tell whoever the next president is we need to bring gas prices down
9074999 i was wondering what the numbers painted on highway 126 are for i know they are doing a lot of work between redmond and sisters and about every 10 feet numbers are painted either along the center line of on the side line it is very distracting because all these white numbers are coming at my so fast as i drive i notice them between cline falls bridge and buckhorn road and then every so often after buckhorn road until you reach sisters are they going to be there forever

9075007 esa receptividad es un aliciente de que hay esperanzas en este pa s de que en alg n momento de la historia pueda estar en vigencia la cpi y que nicaragua sea parte de ese concierto de naciones que est n dispuestas a luchar contra la impunidad

9075012 they were suffering from metastazing brain tumors caused by various cancers mainly lung and breast cancer that failed to respond to conventional treatment and were otherwise inoperable
9075013 the patients feels nothing during the operation and generally can leave hospital 14 hours later the evening or the morning after the operation
9075014 this is the first time that laser technology has been used intracranially meaning inside an enclosed skull using mri in real time to avoid collateral damage

9075021 patrick ewing will have an opportunity here to compete for a spot on our roster
9075022 he is a solid defensive player and a very good athlete
9075023 its not worse which is important now the thing is its not better either and it seems like the only way to repair it completely is arthroscopic surgery
9075024 my plan was to be part of the olympic games and i knew that if i suffered from pain they would have to operate
9075025 this is obviously one of our bigger loads and so were happy to have all of this equipment here so we can really get rolling
9075026 it really is taking that area that we had in the northwest and trying to make sure it fits here in this space and so far its been a pretty good fit
9075027 its been a little bit of a puzzle but its all worked out very nicely
9075028 were arranging counselling for the families as well as the police officers because of the numbers and the amount of notifications the police have had to do
9075029 we would be very interested in trying to attract the commonwealth to co invest in light rail within the act
9075030 we think it is significant this is the national capital its a significant issue and in response now the commonwealth has asked us for a full business case
9075031 i think many south australians families children athletes will see mr foleys remarks as arrogant and out of touch
9075032 its been about what is best for morris iemma and michael costa in their battle with the war in the labor party
9075033 its about them trying to control their own mps and that means the state is coming a poor second
9075034 our prime minister said he was going to support working families
9075035 well some of the hardest working families that i know are farming families and the level of assistance they get it pitiful
9075036 i would just appeal to him to show some generosity of spirit cut the red tape get rid of all this bureaucracy and just use some common sense to help these farming families to get through
9075037 financial incentives attract people to a profession and it is an element but ultimately the financial incentive isnt the main incentive for teachers seeing their student do well its not about that it is the intrinsic value of seeing a job well done mr lampe said
9075038 passengers in phuket have been accommodated if they havent been able to remain in their hotels that they were already staying in
9075039 thats the situation until we have advice that we can operate out
9075040 there are on going large political demonstrations in bangkok a number of which have been disruptive and have blocked access to key buildings and roads
9075041 the demonstrations have also affected access to some airports including in bangkok phuket hat yai and krabi and disrupted some rail and air services
9075042 its quite a large fire and quite a complex fire in the sense that its got a number of dangerous chemicals that we are dealing with at this point in time
9075043 we will investigate it once the fire has been extinguished and then we will get in later today or tomorrow morning
9075044 there is a fair bit to still take under control and well be here for a number of hours yet throughout the day
9075045 one of the things thats so fantastic about living in canberra is that its a multicultural community
9075046 a lot of people think that is just the embassy strip but thats not true at all its something like 90 per cent of canberra can trace their roots back to a different country
9075047 weve said that canberra is a welcoming city for say migrants and refugees but you know words are cheap unless you put up
9075048 we were competitive for 65 minutes but then you cant play 10 of those last 15 minutes with 14 players against a physical bulls outfit we were never going to get away with it
9075049 it does have something to do with desperation as it happens when the guys are trying really hard but i think you can describe it as something between stupidity and effort
9075050 it was extremely physical out there i got kicked in the head in the first few minutes but then thats how it is with the bulls youve just got to expect these cheap shots
9075051 we will never throw in the towel and as far as i know all the boks will be available next week we will have to manage them accordingly but that cheetahs game is going to be a crucial one

9075053 the shareholders feel that the time has come for a parting of the ways
9075054 we want to hold amicable discussions with them over how that might be achieved but there has been a breakdown in relationships that unfortunately cannot be repaired
9075055 the performances are a worry i dont want to make it sound like an excuse but weve seen it in the super 14 and the tri nations for a number of years now at some point you have to start asking is this good for south african rugby
9075056 there have been 12 tri nations tournaments since 1996 in eight of those competitions south africa has only won one game its quite sobering even if we win on saturday it is still a bleak situation with two wins from six
9075057 but that is not the case in the tri nations this competition is crying out for a revamp and an expansion
9075058 its not just a review but an opportunity to offer solutions and discuss ideas
9075059 what do you tell the people who hate mccain but like you
9075060 am i the only one that thinks he doesnt deserve this senator clinton had millions of democrat votes even more then biden and yet wasnt even vetted by obama
9075061 well it looks like a b c is greater than the cost of a recall on this one
9075062 gm spokeswoman carolyn markey said there have been nine reports of fires and three of them have been linked to the system
9075063 should something that is not science be taught in a science class room
9075064 i dont think there should be a prohibition against debate if it comes up in class it doesnt have to be part of the curriculum
9075065 i wont have religion as a litmus test or anybodys personal opinion on evolution or creationism
9075066 i dont think there should be a prohibition against debate if it comes up in class it doesnt have to be part of the curriculum
9075067 in a 2006 gubernatorial debate the soon to be governor of alaska said of evolution and creation education
9075068 while running for governor of alaska palin advocated the teaching of both creationism and evolution in public schools 48 but the next day she said
9075069 i think we can all look forward to the time when these three theories are given equal time in our science classrooms across the country and eventually the world one third time for intelligent design one third time for flying spaghetti monsterism and one third time for logical conjecture based on overwhelming observable evidence
9075070 and whatever happened to separation of church and state in this country
9075071 pinpointed three crucial molecular switches that when flipped completely convert a common cell in the pancreas into the more precious insulin producing ones that diabetics need to survive
9075072 its kind of an extreme makeover of a cell the goal is to create cells that are missing or defective in people its very exciting
9075073 the major issues facing the country from terrorism and war to the economy and the direction of our culture
9075074 on the role of the presidency and the qualities that are demanded by the job
9075075 in particular it highlights mccains unique judgment perspective and experience to deal with the unexpected to stand firm on his convictions put the country above himself and make hard decisions necessary to protect the american people
9075076 this is not an opportunity to recap accomplishments of the past seven and a half years
9075077 it will not serve as a farewell to the american people and it certainly will not attack barack obama
9075078 this president knows better than almost any politician in america what its like to face criticism he watched his dad as vice presidential candidate for two terms go through that and then when his dad ran for president he saw it again and then in his own campaigns the two national
9075079 senator mccain will bring a lifetime of experiance to the white house and senator obama will bring a speech he made in 2002

9075111 we cant figure out what streets were going to be able to use and which we cant
9075112 we were trying to use the macys parking lot for the main stage and now thats not going to happen it just made too much work too much uncertainty

9075114 i have yelp to thank for discovering this gem of a salon
9075115 the news was so stunning i refused to believe it until i saw john mccain on the tv screen announcing his pick for vice president

9075117 as they arrive in minneapolis for their convention republicans cannot evade the monuments to their misrule
9075118 at the end of the cold war the united states was supreme and unchallenged russia was in decay poor disorganised with ill equipped military forces
9075119 after the cold war the neo conservatives sought to cement american supremacy
9075120 remember that clutch of outspoken and confident lawyers who in last years torture debates bravely came out for the freedom to torture
9075121 i was on a panel somewhere and i was asked what could have prevented klebold and harris from committing those murders on that particular day
9075122 where i really struggle is what caused so much hate in those kids hearts that they would kill their classmates and their teachers and they would kill themselves youre talking about kamikazes but the kamikazes had a deep national and religious reason to do what they did with klebold and harris there was only this aspect that they had to do it so that their names would live forever and you can go on these web sites that are dedicated to them and its like they do live forever

9075138 theres been a lot of trend pieces about pc gaming is dying and the decline of the pc when thats absolutely not true and in fact its not dying
9075139 yesterday thursday we were seeing more of a southwest movement but today we are seeing more of a west northwest movement and only slightly faster than what we saw yesterday
9075140 its still heading toward the louisiana coast with the midtrack line
9075141 however with the large cone of error still possible the entire texas coast is still under a threat with any areas from corpus christi to the northeast under some kind of significant threat
9075142 given what we know now at h minus 92 hurricane gustav presents a very very clear and present threat to the state of texas as a category four hurricane forecasts predict a category three storm but state officials always plan for one category up
9075143 the impact area is unknown with any specifics but our priority right now for planning our priority for execution beginning tomorrow is southeast texas thats beaumont orange jefferson hardin and chambers counties to get those medical special needs moved out of there
9075144 the state of texas will begin now to pre deploy resources to beaumont houston and galveston
9075145 well be prepared to begin air operations at 9 a m tomorrow morning in the beaumont port arthur area medical special needs evacuees
9075146 i dont think you could be prouder to be a texan today as you see the cooperation over the labor day weekend across the state
9075147 so if youre an evacuated community i hope you sleep well tonight knowing there is a whole lot of communities across texas working this weekend for your citizens in the event that they evacuate
9075148 that is a very humbling thought when you think about the scope of this
9075149 obviously fill up fuel tanks obviously have water dust off your hurricane campaigns whatever youre personally doing and get that kind of thing ready
9075150 and let family members know outside of matagorda county when and where you are planning on going
9075151 we only do mandatory evacuations for citizens living below the intercoastal in the event that the bridges are going to get locked
9075152 one of the things that is so hard is to get people to not look at the center line
9075153 look at that cone of error there that the national weather service puts out
9075154 so many people look at that center line and say well we dont have anything to worry about and they wait until its pointed directly at us
9075155 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
9075156 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
9075157 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
9075158 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
9075159 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
9075160 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
9075161 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop

9075163 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
9075164 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
9075165 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
9075166 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
9075167 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with

9075176 people dont tend to be as active in switching energy suppliers when the economy is bad but our new dual fuel offering and an increase in marketing spend should help persuade more customers that we are an efficient option
9075177 home heat generation provides security in peoples energy supply as well as economy and were confident uptake will be strong
9075178 weve already seen a 50 per cent increase in hits on that section of our web site
9075179 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
9075180 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
9075181 we got to within two miles but theyre up on the face of a mountain so thats whats preventing the search

9075197 as investiga es come aram a partir de queixas repetidas de roubo de cigarros na capital
9075198 conseguimos prender uma parte da quadrilha e com o desenrolar do trabalho devemos chegar ao restante do grupo
9075199 assistimos a um momento de grande envergadura hist rica nos eua desde as prim rias de iowa obama veio mostrando que um movimento nascido do povo para terminar o trabalho de eq idade social iniciado por king e o povo est respondendo
9075200 obama parte e talvez sintoma de um movimento c vico que veio sendo forjado para exigir uma mudan a na cultura pol tica do pa s para provar algo diferente
9075201 por defini o os conservadores n o gostam de mudan a mas os republicanos tamb m montaram nesse trem o senador e candidato republicano john mccain repete que inclusive bateu de frente com seu partido em nome da mudan a
9075202 o conceito de depend ncia sexual pol mico e por isso dif cil defini lo
9075203 muitos criticam esse conceito porque vivemos numa sociedade que tende a medicalizar as coisas em excesso e transforma todo comportamento que se desvia da norma em depend ncia ou dist rbio
9075204 a internet forneceu um n vel de acesso pornografia antes indispon vel muita gente tem esse problema e a internet induziu a isso
9075205 n o h d vida de que o personagem interpretado por duchovny sexualmente compulsivo isso destruiu seu casamento e o programa mostra algumas das ramifica es do comportamento sexual do personagem sobre sua filha o que bastante realista

9075207 sab amos que havia um monte de consultores militares dos eua na ge rgia mas instrutores professores e pessoal de armamento militar deveriam estar em estandes de tiro e centros de treinamento mas onde estavam estavam na zona de opera es militares
9075208 e isso nos leva conclus o de que a lideran a dos estados unidos sabia da a o que estava sendo preparada e muito provavelmente dela participou de forma significativa a crise foi provocada inclusive por nossos amigos americanos na rota da luta eleitoral
9075209 ent o tenho a suspeita de que isso foi feito especialmente para organizar uma pequena guerra vitoriosa
9075210 e se n o funcionou a que se fa a a r ssia parecer como um inimigo e nesses termos que se una o eleitorado em torno de um candidato presidencial nesse caso do partido governista
9075211 n o o caso isso simplesmente fazer malabarismo com os fatos uma mentira
9075212 i just feel the city should have stepped in sooner
9075213 this is where they had to rip the ceilings out because its connected to next door
9075214 vacant boarded structures are a challenge for the neighbors and for the city theyre a challenge for the fire department and police department all vacants are an attractive nuisance
9075215 its a relief but i guess ill believe it when i see it

9075223 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
9075224 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
9075225 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
9075226 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
9075227 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
9075228 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
9075229 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
9075230 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
9075231 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
9075232 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
9075233 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
9075234 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
9075235 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
9075236 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
9075237 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
9075238 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
9075239 who are open to doing something on the production side
9075240 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
9075241 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
9075242 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
9075243 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill

9075302 this is a race against time the international community needs to respond quickly before winter when conditions deteriorate

9075307 if we are going to conserve them we need to know more about them where they live what causes the nests to die
9075308 the last few years have been really bad for bumblebees we think its probably the weather but we dont know we need to know how many nests there are we need to find the nests to know how long they live and what destroys them
9075309 bumblebees are very important to the environment as pollinators of crops and flowers but sadly they are struggling to survive in the modern world of habitat loss pesticides and intensive agriculture
9075310 further decline in bumblebees could result in a downward cycle of poorer harvests and sweeping changes to the countryside as wild flowers set less seed and disappear which in turn could have catastrophic effects for other wildlife
9075311 and i think its going to be more profound and long lasting than people thought
9075312 weve got our work cut out this coming 12 months will be the most difficult 12 months the labour party has had in a generation
9075313 weve got to rediscover that zeal which won three elections and that is a huge problem for us at the moment people are pissed off with us
9075314 we really have to make our minds up are we ready to try and persuade this country to support us for another term because the next 12 months are critical its still there to play for

9075324 troopers were involved in both stops of the motorist in question
9075325 texas state troopers were engaged in direct policing contrary to rcmp policy
9075326 we all know that a police officer from outside the country doesnt have the powers of a peace officer here in b c
9075327 we had concerns about what are texas rangers doing stopping cars and engaging in active law enforcement in canada
9075328 unfortunately though the commission substantiated a lot of our complaint it didnt go that far as to say its bad policy for the rcmp to use foreign officers to enforce the law in canada
9075329 on the threshold of the new world order a rebirth for the united nations
9075330 my concern is where are the spiritual fathers that god has put within the body of christ we are supposed to be actively allowing god in christ to do through ephesians 4 11 15 what paul had written to the people at ephesus but is also for the body today why has this lust thing been allowed to invade gods body which is jesus body the church what happened here how did we come to this
9075331 every way of a man is right in his own eyes
9075332 although the loss of lives is deeply saddening this act of god destroyed a wicked city
9075333 from girls gone wild to southern decadence new orleans was a city that had its doors wide open to the public celebration of sin from the devastation may a city full of righteousness emerge
9075334 we must help and pray for those ravaged by this disaster but let us not forget that the citizens of new orleans tolerated and welcomed the wickedness in their city for so long
9075335 may this act of god cause us all to think about what we tolerate in our city limits and bring us trembling before the throne of almighty god
9075336 when fierce temptations threat thy soul with loss think on his passion and the bitter pain think on the mortal anguish of the cross think on christs blood let out at every vein think of his precious heart all rent in twain for thy redemption think all this was wrought nor be that lost which he so dearly bought

9075350 i take advice in matters spiritual and religious from the ghost of archbishop cranmer his blog is a role model for niche blogs of all descriptions thoughtful erudite and provocative

9075357 i think republicans are more accustomed to following the rules
9075358 were used to sitting in the cheap seats weve got binoculars
9075359 well basically marta it means that everything will turn out to be great
9075360 we need to boil that down we need to figure what changes have to be made to accommodate the concerns that are raised
9075361 theres been positive feedback but theres also been some adjustments that need to be made and we really need to sit down and talk about that and put our best foot forward
9075362 what are the adjustments that have to happen not to assume we got it all 100 per cent completely right
9075363 in my mind its a statement of principles its not a recipe
9075364 i think if we talk to people and tell them this is a statement of principles of intent and during the implementation that theres leeway to discuss with canadians i think thats the logical way to do it
9075365 what you really want is a missing cell type one that is not functioning properly to be derived from something else but you only want that cell type so i think this is a really important step forward in exercising what people really wanted and showing how well it can work by this gene over expression procedure
9075366 provides exciting new insights into yet another aspect of cell plasticity that was not appreciated previously and that offers great potential therapeutically direct reprogramming represents a more straight forward strategy to treat diseases involving loss of function of specific cell populations than approaches requiring an intermediate embryonic stem cell
9075367 more than a little surprised to find that we could use a combination of just three transcription factors to reprogram one cell type into another
9075368 combined a systematic approach to identifying the relevant transcription factors hard work and a bit of luck
9075369 by asking what genes you have to have turned on in the cell for it to become a beta cell
9075370 if you want to do reprogramming it doesnt take great insight to figure out that the key genes are transcription factors the proteins that bind dna and tell cells which genes to turn on and which to turn off
9075371 and the locks are transcription factors we asked which ones are present in the beta cell and that gave us 1 100 transcription factors to choose from eventually we learned that of the 1 100 only about 200 are actually expressed in cells that are involved in forming the pancreas
9075372 we decided that of the 200 we only cared about the ones that are expressed in the key part of the pancreas where the beta cells are and that got us down to about 28 then we did some lineage studies
9075373 and we got it down to nine joe said my best guess is its these nine and he were right it was a messy experiment mixing all nine and injecting them into the pancreas then we found out that it got better and better as we removed one gene at a time from the nine and eventually we found that it actually works best with three transcription factors that six of them arent that important and thats the fun of science
9075374 if it hadnt worked with those nine wed probably have dropped the experiment and gone onto something else there would have been just too many possible combinations of transcription factors to wade through
9075375 were intrigued by the possibility that this approach which has worked for pancreatic insulin producing cells could be more widely applied to many kind of cells especially those that are lost in disease or following injury
9075376 and at the same time we are exploring the possibility of using this general approach in a clinical context to make new beta cells for patients

9075405 definitely we see this as a very punitive lawsuit that is designed to try and stop our efforts and to send a very big chill to other folks who are bringing to light some of the immense problems associated with the development of the alberta tarsands and syncrude specifically
9075406 for them to take this type of over the top action show some of the success of our organization and other people in bringing to light some of the devastation thats occurring with the tarsands
9075407 we run a large mining operation with some of the most complex and largest equipment in the world so theres a risk involved if you dont know how to drive or navigate those areas so we wanted to make sure something like this didnt happen again
9075408 these people didnt have the training or the escort they needed to ensure their safety and well being and its quite concerning that they came on our site without authorization and the proper escort because of the severe safety implications of doing so
9075409 we know theres an important discussion and debate about the oilsands and were an active part of that and we think thats an important process we just think there are more proactive and responsible ways to do that
9075410 has the record of reform and bipartisanship that others can only speak of
9075411 her experience in shaking up the status quo is exactly what is needed in washington today
9075412 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
9075413 at at the end of the third reich collapse there was a dash across europe to recover v 2 missiles and components
9075414 as for germany itself the reaction of germany in the aftermath of 9 11 really showed up that when push comes to shove not a lot had changed
9075415 we are very excited to acquire the rights of andrej meszaros this evening
9075416 andrej is a perfect fit within our plan to rebuild the lightning into a contender he has a strong all around game he competes he moves the puck and he can handle big strong forwards defensively perhaps most importantly were pleased to add a 22 year old player with almost 250 nhl games already under his belt we know andrej will continue to grow and improve as he matures with the rest of our defense filip kuba and alex picard for their service to the lightning its hard letting go of players that we like but as we all know you cant get something for nothing we needed to move assets in order to bring andrej to the lightning and we certainly feel we are a better more competitive team because of this trade

9075424 the shooting yesterday thursday in the iqlim al toffah region at a lebanese army helicopter and the martyrdom of captain samer hanna is a sad and painful incident that involves certain circumstances which will be revealed through investigation god willing this entire case in all of its details is in the hands of the lebanese judiciary since it represents the legal reference to settle it hezbollah will fully cooperate with the brothers in the lebanese army as well as with concerned judicial authorities to bring out the truth and guarantee justice in this painful occasion we offer our sincere condolences to the family of martyr samer hanna and our brothers in the lebanese army and we express our deep grief over what happened we consider captain samer hanna a martyr for lebanon the resistance and the army we hope that all political groups would refrain from offering baseless explanations to a yet unclear incident and leave the case to the concerned judicial body to settle
9075425 the helicopter had to make an emergency landing over the soujod hill what led to the martyrdom of lieutenant samer hanna the incident is under investigation
9075426 there is no government in jerusalem that would ever reconcile itself to a nuclear iran when it is clear iran is on the verge of acquiring nuclear weapons an israeli military strike to prevent this will be seriously considered
9075427 sane cheap and the only option that does not necessitate bloodshed
9075428 its a shame because ido will light all this up
9075429 is like investing in krups steelworks in 1938 its a high risk investment
9075430 9 out of 10 of our graduates find employment within 6 months
9075431 it is the intent of the legislative council that the investigation be professional unbiased independent objective and conducted at arms length from the political process
9075432 i think what it really gets down to is after the comma add potential abuses of power and improper actions is really what we are looking at or at least proposing to look at
9075433 no evidence of wrong doing some evidence of wrong doing clear evidence of wrong doing that will come back to us
9075434 at that point the body has to make the decision is this evidence strong enough to proceed on or not
9075435 i think it should be made very clear because there have been conversations about personnel matters that the issues really that we are dealing with here are not the termination of the public courtesy ktoo tv safety commissioner
9075436 are those professionals going to feel compelled to be subpoenaed before they will speak candidly about what they know
9075437 she knows where she comes from and she knows who she works for
9075438 she stands up for whats right and she doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down
9075439 lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling
9075440 at first they had me in a bunch of furs
9075441 yeah i have furs on my wall but i dont wear furs i had to show them my bunny boots and my north face clothing
9075442 a woman of faith who has a strong position on life a consistent opinion on judges
9075443 i think it might be a little big for me
9075444 dont laugh at me i told you it wouldnt fit
9075445 you can visit the first job boards that come to mind and that step will certainly give you a check mark in the box labeled
9075446 de ce universul care prin definitie inglobeaza tot ceea ce exista exista
9075447 were in real danger of losing what makes maps so unique giving us a feel for a place even if weve never been there
9075448 the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner its agent or the law
9075449 it looks like the storm is going to stay on its current track so the entire metropolitan area is going to experience stress
9075450 they are going to go to safe places and thats all they need to know
9075451 the timing of this its like adding insult to injury
9075452 i think god might be reminding us that he can send mother nature back
9075453 people are loading up and taking as much as they can with them we are seeing people with trailers nearly every vehicle is just loaded down
9075454 if prisoners were found out to have money or other assets they might find themselves coerced into marriages with more powerful inmates who then might try to lay claim to half their net worth
9075455 what happened in georgia is a good sign one that means america is no longer the sole world power setting the rules of the game
9075456 there is a balance in the world now russia is resurging which is good for us for the entire middle east
9075457 this russian invasion of georgia is a turning point in the relations of the atlantic community with russia including of course turkey
9075458 there is a change in the paradigm a change in assessment
9075459 people forget that verbal abuse is equally unhealthy as physical abuse
9075460 my kids used to see me crying and depressed all the time and that can affect kids as well
9075461 now if i get a little down or sad and my daughter notices and asks whether im okay i say yes im fine
9075462 i constantly talk to him about how to treat a woman he tells me everything
9075463 i promised myself that if i ever had kids i would be open with them
9075464 because of the molestation i experienced as a child i feel nervous for egypt so i make sure to ask her those questions i always have to tell her that she has to tell me if anyone bothers her and that i wont be mad at her because i love her because silence kills and people who abuse depend on their victims silence as a tool to continue to victimize others
9075465 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
9075466 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
9075467 its been three years since hurricane katrina devastated the gulf coast
9075468 in the aftermath several hundred families took refuge in green country and many decided to stay including monica burns who now calls tulsa home but she will never forget what she left behind
9075469 and we didnt know what it was from and thats when people say somebody ran into the levee and it broke a lot of people died on the other side
9075470 at at the end of the third reich collapse there was a dash across europe to recover v 2 missiles and components
9075471 as for germany itself the reaction of germany in the aftermath of 9 11 really showed up that when push comes to shove not a lot had changed
9075472 when they told me the news that von trips was dead and more than a dozen spectators with him i was stunned deeply shocked
9075473 the papers reported that i broke down and sobbed but that was not true when youve lived as close to death and danger as long as i have then your emotional defences are equal to almost anything
9075474 you can get a clean unused 9mm automatic for 1 500 a glock for a couple of grand and you can even make an order for a couple of mac 10s
9075475 or you can get a little sawn off for 150 theyre easy enough to get hold of youll find one in any poverty area every estate in london and its even easier in manchester where there are areas where the police dont go
9075476 people who use shotguns tend to be lower down the pecking order there is less use of sawn off or full length shotguns and if a criminal wants street cred he wants a self loading pistol a mac 10 or an uzi submachine gun
9075477 there has been an influx from eastern europe and particularly from poland and there are also a lot coming in from people who have served in afghanistan and iraq
9075478 in liverpool docks you can put in an order for 10 guns and some grenades and theyll say ok and two weeks later they will be there and they are straight goers
9075479 they are legally sold in germany and wont fire a bullet but they can be converted by removing the partially blocked barrel and replacing it with a rifled barrel
9075480 after other small alterations it can then fire 9mm bulleted ammunition the replacement barrel is longer than the original and is threaded so that it will accept a silencer which is commonly sold as part of the package
9075481 there are hundreds of these floating around and hundreds have been seized
9075482 they look the part as they are based on the russian military makarov pistol if you are a 20 year old drug dealer and you want a gun that is what you will get and it will cost about 1 000 to 1 500
9075483 about two years ago a supplier brought back hundreds of german made revolvers blank firing pistols which can be bought legally in germany they were then converted and new cylinders made they could then be sold for 700 to 800 when the supplier would have bought them for 60 and spent about 30 on converting them
9075484 someone will have a tool and there is always one guy in a posse willing to use it they will have one guy who doesnt give a fuck
9075485 everyone wants to be a gangster now mainly the kids you have five or six in a little crew and one of them will be carrying they want handguns shotguns are too big and bulky the sawn off doesnt look so good but use a machine gun and you get known as a heavy guy they have them just to be a chap on the street to pose some of them walk around all day with a 38 its 16 year olds at it and its getting like america silly as it sounds
9075486 whos using the guns the jamaican yardies value for life was so minimal that they thought nothing of killing people
9075487 we dont like them they have no moral code but its the russians and the polish and albanians around now they are bullies they want to take over the flesh business the russians are cold hearted fuckers what they have been doing is following the card boys who put cards advertising prostitutes in phone booths in central london and then taking the girls hostage armed if need be
9075488 and drug dealers are taking a policy decision to get youngsters to carry guns
9075489 you can hire a gun for a period and if the gun has already been used for a murder the going rate comes down
9075490 you can go to the former soviet union or countries with less stringent regulations than ours and although british customs have their successes many guns appear to be smuggled into the uk
9075491 all you get handed in are guns from boys who wanted to be gangsters and then got a job or someone whose mother found it in their bedroom if i had a gun i wouldnt take part because if i got pulled what would i say oh im just on my way to the amnesty also if it gets out that youve given in your tool people will think youre a wrong un
9075492 only silly people keep it in their homes normally you have a keeper a couple of miles away and some of them have been at it for 20 years its best to have an old fellow with no previous or a woman you keep the ammunition separate because youll get a much heavier sentence if you have them together
9075493 i went to the cemetery and said well boy i can put you to rest
9075494 i shed tears every day and i probably will till the day i die why do these people have to kill for nothing if they want to kill people why dont they join the army you dont ever think a shooting will happen in your life its all down to guns just guns
9075495 a gun used to be used as a mediator now everything is revolved with a gun its brought the heat on everyone before you would get a two years jail sentence now its a five its getting like the us now like the wire its like a prediction of what will happen here i think they all think theyre playing grand theft auto its madness out there
9075496 europe had all the cards they have negotiated in bad faith we have been bullied into this
9075497 this is the best performing british team since 1908 theyre the golden team
9075498 were looking for four or five deals worth around 400 000 each
9075499 could there be a 1m contract out there yes probably could it get to 2m in total id like to think so
9075500 i most want to get a kit deal so that i dont keep buying equipment for swimming
9075501 the smart athletes should wait for the dust to settle
9075502 brands are going to want to have a gold medallist in their portfolio in the run up to 2012
9075503 the whole point is that we want to take visa to as many people as possible the athletes can do that
9075504 theres a slight lessening of the sponsorship because of the sheer number of gold medals we won and the number of sportsmen and women involved
9075505 someone like christine because shes an olympic champion in athletics can earn up to 50 000 just for turning up to events
9075506 given the poor outlook on household spending for 2009 we were overly optimistic to expect a return to growth in the sector next spring
9075507 we are increasingly concerned that household expenditure will continue to fall well into 2009 and so pub profitability is unlikely to recover until 2010
9075508 even if it were to become a reit we believe it would trade at a discount to its net asset value given there is some uncertainty about its conversion our target price has been lowered to 270p
9075509 the financing of a potential takeover has been an issue in the past but would be significantly easier if bertelsmann is prepared to dilute its holding in rtl
9075510 strategically we believe it would make sense for rtl bertelsmann to make a move for itv given the lack of scale in the uk market although a disposal of channel five is likely to be required to get regulatory approval for the deal
9075511 poker is still 60 of revenue and with growth sluggish we are downgrading our forecasts more in line with consensus
9075512 there are no specific deadlines but we will try to come to a conclusion as soon as possible if airlines which normally compete get together we have to make sure it is not to the detriment of consumers
9075513 we look forward to showing the commission how our plans will benefit consumers
9075514 set a chain of events in motion from which it was impossible for us to recover
9075515 we have been working on a financing deal for the company for two months and we have been making very good progress with that
9075516 we fully expected we would be able to continue flying but the problems that we encountered during the day on thursday however with a number of aircraft being seized by airports authorities such as the one in glasgow made it very difficult clearly you cant run an airline without aircraft
9075517 were travelling from edinburgh to ottawa via new york it was around 1 000 for the flights plus we had to pay for a night in a hotel
9075518 we tried to get a flight until 11pm last night thursday then realised wed have to come back this morning friday
9075519 with a slight fear of being tackled by police i hopped on the highest counter i could see and shouted out the news
9075520 ppr is confident in its outlook for the second half of 2008 and stands by its objectives for growth and improved financial performance
9075521 we are the big guys on the street and we will remain in that position
9075522 weve seen the end of the very big blockbuster the likes of lipitor
9075523 theres not enough time for a product to become a massive blockbuster theres so much competition in the market
9075524 it takes 550m and 10 12 years to bring a new drug to the patient
9075525 its an investment in public health its only natural that the companies need to make a return on this initial investment
9075526 nice needs to combine pure economic arithmetic with other considerations the severity of the condition the availability of alternative treatments the consequences of refusing treatment in terms of the length and quality of life and the savings in the use of carers
9075527 the idea of early dialogue is now accepted on both sides
9075528 the increased rigour in being able to get a product to market means that far more molecules have to be screened before a likely candidate can be positively identified
9075529 we can expect drug research in large well served areas like pain relief to be reduced
9075530 new drugs for niche conditions are likely to be fantastically expensive in many cases it will seem like blackmail without government assistance or insurance treatment will simply not be affordable for many
9075531 the odds seem lower than in the us but the pressures to enhance drug marketing and co opt the regulators are ever present there is a lot of money at stake
9075532 gsk must change if it is to be successful in the future
9075533 are we still underfunding our health service we get good value for money but if we put more money in would peoples health improve
9075534 guidance is for margins to continue falling and arrears to continue rising earnings outlook is therefore very weak the margin issue is the lack of ability to write new business currently available at higher margins at least in part due to funding constraints
9075535 the boards priority has been to ensure that we can continue to fund our business safely and we have achieved this
9075536 the team at ciao has built a passionate consumer community based on intuitive technology and extensive merchant relationships that we believe will deliver incremental benefit to the microsoft live search platform
9075537 the worsening economic environment continuing competitive pressure and a slower realisation of the benefits of marketing initiatives
9075538 y8888b 888 888 888 888 888 888 d88p 888 888 888 888 y88b 888 x88 888 y88 88p y88b 888 8888888p

9075542 this storm has the potential for being a very dangerous storm
9075543 mama did you see that tall man smile at me every time i brought him a sandwich i liked him i brought him many sandwiches and drinks too he was nice he told me how pretty my dress was and he sat with the prettiest ladies mama i want to be a pretty lady when i grow up

9075547 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9075548 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9075549 marted scorso sono venuto ad arezzo con lunica premura di aver invitato tutti i membri del comitato provinciale uscente per ringraziarli del lavoro svolto durante le elezioni ai presenti ho illustrato il programma dibattuto nellultima direzione nazionale udc
9075550 la linea politica del partito prosegue quella del segretario cesa e di pier ferdinando casini che ci pone alternativi alla sinistra e non annessi al pdl sicuri di esser la spina dorsale del partito popolare europeo in italia il mio compito come commissario quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale affinch gli organi dinformazione possano porre lattenzione su di unazione politica importante senza dar adito a polemiche strumentali che interessano solo chi le alimenta
9075551 in tal senso spiega abbiamo gi attivato nelle maggiori citt della provincia lapertura dei gazebo per la raccolta delle firme per la reintroduzione del voto di preferenza nella legge elettorale avremo poi la festa nazionale di chianciano terme 11 14 settembre p v che ci vedr protagonisti vista la vicinanza geografica dopodich avvieremo una seria verifica con gli iscritti al fine di giungere alle scadenze elettorali 2009 con una definita compagine politico amministrativa
9075552 non possiamo dunque accettare che qualcuno parli sin dora di alleanze con chicchessia chiarisce pur senza dimenticare che la nostra storia ci vede da sempre in provincia di arezzo alternativi alla sinistra in qualsivoglia amministrazione
9075553 ludc valuta positivamente le aperture che ci vengono a livello locale e regionale dagli esponenti del centro destra ma al di l di quelle non vi sono stati ancora incontri ufficiali giudico prematuro e fuorviante parlare di alleanze politiche in questo momento chi ha voglia di impegnarsi nelludc ha la possibilit di farlo sia nel partito sia nelle amministrazioni locali alla ricerca del bene comune e dellinteresse generale
9075554 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9075555 e necessario che anche la regione toscana nella sua veste di soggetto istituzionale coinvolto nellapprovazione del progetto della terza corsia autostradale faccia completamente la sua parte per quanto attiene la verifica delle modalit di realizzazione sia della nuova galleria del melarancio nel tratto fra certosa e scandicci che dellintero tratto autostradale in fase di realizzazione attorno a firenze
9075556 gli interessi in gioco non sono infatti di rilevanza esclusivamente locale afferma ma riguardano lintera viabilit a livello regionale e addirittura nazionale se infatti la tempistica dei lavori e la stessa fattibilit del progetto divenissero incerti si rischierebbe veramente di tagliare in due il paese e di arrecare danni incalcolabili alleconomia dellintera area fiorentina e a quella regionale
9075557 a questo punto prosegue carraresi un intervento della regione toscana attraverso i propri uffici e il pieno e tempestivo coinvolgimento di altri soggetti regionali quali lazienda sanitaria e larpat divengono veramente urgenti
9075558 di riferire su quanto accaduto gi nel corso della prima seduta consiliare di settembre
9075559 un deciso intervento affinch ogni ipotesi di cassa integrazione per i dipendenti che rischiano di rimanere inattivi a causa dello stop ai lavori venga limitato ai tempi tecnici strettamente necessari
9075560 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9075561 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9075562 s al voto di preferenza il giovanile motore del partito
9075563 si propone come motore del partito sul territorio giovani e giovanissimi mettono a disposizione il proprio tempo libero perch credono che questa iniziativa proposta da casini in prima persona possa rafforzare la nostra democrazia in quanto pi autorevole il parlamentare eletto a seguito del voto di preferenza di migliaia di cittadini piuttosto che il parlamentare nominato insindacabile dalle segreterie di partito ridotto troppo spesso di conseguenza al ruolo di yes man
9075564 i gazebo per la raccolta delle firme saranno solo il primo impulso per rodare la macchina del gruppo giovani e raccogliere le prime impressioni delle persone illustrando nel contempo le linee guida del nostro partito che vede giorno dopo giorno premiare la coraggiosa scelta identitaria dello scorso aprile
9075565 del resto aggiunge piersante morandini coordinatore nazionale a margine dellassemblea tenuta in data 25 agosto con i giovani di arezzo lentusiasmo di arezzo contagiante non un caso che proprio ai ragazzi di arezzo richiesto uno sforzo notevole per dare il benvenuto ai giovani di tutta italia alla festa nazionale dellunione di centro che si terr a chianciano terme si dall11 al 14 settembre
9075566 il presidente pierfendinando casini sa di poter trovare nei giovani una locomotiva di entusiasmo e grinta per rinnovare dal basso questa nostra italia
9075567 non certamente casuale la citt sta divenendo sempre pi il capoluogo di tendenza della valdichiana oltre ai numerosi vip che la rendono trendy la citt sta diventando un must anche per i politici italiani indipendentemente dallo schieramento politico naturale quindi che i giovani abbiano scelto una localit cool per mettersi alla prova in vista dellimpegno che li vedr protagonisti a chianciano
9075568 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9075569 un provvedimento serio e condivisibile perch in italia esiste una vera e propria emergenza educativa a cui la scuola non pu sottrarsi
9075570 ludc ha sempre creduto fina dalla scorsa legislatura nella necessit di reintrodurre il voto in condotta e di riportare nelle aule scolastiche lo studio delleducazione civica quindi non possiamo che essere soddisfatti cera bisogno da parte del governo di un segnale forte ed arrivato conclude ciocchetti adesso spetta ai docenti rendere efficaci le nuove disposizioni
9075571 were headed to the next adventure out on the plains of meridiani
9075572 we safely got into the crater we completed our exploration there and we safely got out

9075598 and that pushes one to the conclusion that the leadership of the united states knew about the action that was being prepared and moreover probably took part in it
9075599 if the leadership of the united states had sanctioned that then i have the suspicion that it was done specially to organise a small victorious war
9075600 and if it didnt work then to create from russia the appearance of an enemy and on that ground unite the electorate around one presidential candidate of course the ruling party

9075667 no a ingresso nel pdl con pd dialogo e non intese
9075668 se lofferta quella di entrare nel pdl noi rispondiamo di no perch ci saremmo gi entrati qualche mese prima delle elezioni e con veltroni dialogo in parlamento punto e basta senza equivoci di natura politica
9075669 e comunque facile prevedere precisa che nella gran parte dei casi sar fisiologico una conferma delle alleanze locali con le forze di centrodestra con le quali c un rapporto che dura da pi di 10 anni
9075670 proprio per questo dice cesa teniamo una posizione distinta dal partito democratico evitando di sovrapporre la collaborazione istituzionale tra le forze dellopposizione con lintese politiche che non ci sono

9075683 svendita ad air france che il governo prodi intendeva realizzare
9075684 creare una alitalia nuova una compagnia aerea pi efficiente finanziariamente in equilibrio tecnologicamente avanzata
9075685 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
9075686 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
9075687 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia
9075688 se la nuova compagnia aerea dovesse ritenere utile allearsi con una compagnia straniera questa potr entrare solo come socio di minoranza
9075689 in condizioni meno favorevoli per litalia per i lavoratori i consumatori e gli azionisti
9075690 e facile fare i miracoli con i soldi degli italiani scaricando il buco dellalitalia sulle spalle dei cittadini
9075691 per valutare limpatto che il nuovo piano di ristrutturazione di alitalia avr sulla citt di roma
9075692 c un insieme di strumenti legislativi ammortizzatori sociali in gestione al ministero del lavoro che sono pi che sufficienti a risolvere il problema

9075694 let us make man in our image after our likeness
9075695 what kind of love does god have pro creative love or anti creative love
9075696 are not we as christians called to imitate jesus christ the 2nd person of the trinity
9075697 and god blessed them and god said to them be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it
9075698 therefore a man leaves his father and his mother and cleaves to his wife and they become one flesh
9075699 you were made male and female so that your love could be like our love so that your love could be a pro creative love an unselfish love a life giving love so that your love could bring forth life just as our love brings forth life
9075700 for this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife and the two shall become one this is a great mystery and i mean in reference to christ and the church
9075701 as the church is subject to christ so let wives also be subject in everything to the ir husbands husbands love your wives as christ loved the church and gave himself up for her
9075702 the bible is silent on the issue so we are free to believe as we think best in this area

9075709 contact is usually made by direct junk mail indicating a large lottery win and asking for a small fee or contact details
9075710 scammers then begin telephoning the victim often befriending them and asking them to send increasing sums of money for the supposed release of payment of the non existent lottery win
9075711 payment is often sent to criminals abroad by electronic money transfer making it virtually impossible to track them down
9075712 while intercage has legitimate clients and professes intolerance for abuse it continues to turn a blind eye to massive amounts of cyber crime
9075713 intercage inc previously operated as atrivo inc it was already infamous for abuse then and has not improved its reputation since changing names
9075714 i work very hard to make sure that everything is kept at bay
9075715 unfortunately as you can understand being a dedicated server provider there isnt a way for us to control the content on the servers we can only respond to abuse reports and then proceed to shut down a server or take other action
9075716 some of the companies included in the report have built a reputation in the security community as being havens for this type of activity
9075717 to the extent atrivo does respond to complaints it does so very selectively

9075736 we are increasingly barraged with scams via email the post the internet and phone many people feel they could never be scammed yet millions of people become victims
9075737 you stand practically no chance of getting your money back if you are scammed so the best course of action is to be as prepared as possible
9075738 we know many older people their friends and relations are worried about scams
9075739 people of any age can fall victim to these cons but unfortunately unscrupulous fraudsters often target older people
9075740 the chances of getting your money back on a scam are virtually zero so at could be a very worthwhile investment
9075741 anybody can go onto craigslist and you can copy pictures
9075742 these people coming on stealing our verbiage stealing our pictures

9075744 its really bad and its happening across the whole nation

9075748 yes theres a family that lives next door right now
9075749 if it sounds too good to be true its a big no for me thats a big red flag

9075765 keesha smith whos currently a houseguest on big brother 10 once acted in a movie the fear chamber as her imdb profile revealed
9075766 i dont recognise my team i already raised the alarm last week but i cant do it every weekend
9075767 the british seem to like to laugh about their own stupidity in a funny way
9075768 during the performance when the london bus pulled over all the passengers waiting for the bus rushed into the door at the same time which truly damaged the british image
9075769 its main attraction is considered to be the timetable at the railway station where trains leave for other less rainy cities
9075770 they just dont have time to feel the joy of life
9075771 throughout the week they all work so hard they only talk to people at lunch break then in the evening they come home and watch the telly so they can get up early for work the next day
9075772 i do accept that the money can create a distance between the working class and a working class player
9075773 if the money can be raised to buy this painting
9075774 then the duke of sutherland will offer the gallery a second titian on the cheap for fifty million in the art world of today its a knockdown price
9075775 then something strange happened julie chen gave information about the game to a jury member and even lied
9075776 well he might be the ultimate player of this game because im here to tell you he was not a plant and you are sitting here evicted purely by game play by your fellow housemates who are all just like you total strangers who went in
9075777 definitely i can compete with these girls i dont think the gaps are as big as i once thought
9075778 i go out on court and i feel i have a chance against them today i definitely feel i had a chance it just didnt come together in the way i would have liked it to
9075779 i think shes probably the best british player that i ever played
9075780 she has a very good potential shes very aggressive and she has a good serve the whole game is pretty good
9075781 i just felt i hit too many errors on routine points routine shots
9075782 but i think overall its been a good week for me shes the olympic gold medallist shes one of the favourites for this tournament
9075783 i am happy because we have played two games and won two games but it is difficult
9075784 we now have a big derby on sunday and all the teams are very good
9075785 i like it because i think that any match is up for grabs i think theres a lot of depth
9075786 i think its kind of exciting that a player ranked 180 in the world can beat the number one thats exciting
9075787 someone whos trusting and funny and a good guy who is going to treat her right
9075788 you know passions may fly on immigration but i dont know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts american wages by hiring illegal workers but this too is part of americas promise the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort
9075789 all of the immigrants who came to us brought their own music literature customs and ideas and the marvelous thing a thing of which were proud is they did not have to relinquish these things to fit in in fact what they brought to america became american
9075790 comparing macroeconomic results under the scenarios with those from another set of assumptions under which the deficit in the long run is stabilized at roughly its percentage of gdp in 2007
9075791 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
9075792 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
9075793 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
9075794 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
9075795 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
9075796 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
9075797 there are around 100 000 people from the subcontinent in the province of brescia and they want to play cricket so the council had to provide pitches to stop people being struck by cricket balls
9075798 i struggled to fit in when i arrived but i am now proud to represent italy
9075799 we get friends and family showing up and the odd curious italian while local sri lankan restaurants lay on fish and coconut curry
9075800 satellite tv in italy showed some cricket recently and italian friends said so is that the game youve been playing all this time
9075801 i will not plead in line with my standpoint towards this court
9075802 i have stopped using a false name i think all parties should do the same
9075803 this court is representing itself falsely as a court of the international community whereas it is in fact a court of nato whose aim is to liquidate me
9075804 i have been looking for a running mate that will shake up washington
9075805 we can shatter the glass ceiling once and for all
9075806 john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy a heartbeat away from the presidency
9075807 i do not know too much about her but maybe that is good news
9075808 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
9075809 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
9075810 by not counting the missing the government estimates not only result in inadequate compensation and rehabilitation processes but also underplay the need for rescue and relief
9075811 as for that vp talk all the time ill tell you i still cant answer that question until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the vp does every day
9075812 im used to being very productive and working real hard in an administration
9075813 admitir otras formas de propiedad y producci n en el socialismo
9075814 what do you tell the people who hate mccain but like you
9075815 am i the only one that thinks he doesnt deserve this senator clinton had millions of democrat votes even more then biden and yet wasnt even vetted by obama
9075816 i hope all my fellow children who lost limbs can get out of gaza and get artificial limbs
9075817 i hope the entire world follows the example of this group of activists who broke the siege
9075818 its very bad there its like a prison i wish for freedom in palestine
9075819 i managed to hold him off on the damp section near the start but on the last 15km it was completely dry and when its like that its tough
9075820 it certainly helps although its not easy in some places i took time from mikko easily but in others it was impossible so far its a perfect outcome for the first loop but there are still two long stages to go and i reckon ill need a 20 second lead tonight
9075821 im sorry that this his death was how his kindness was repaid
9075822 i want people to know that our family is proud of kazuya
9075823 well make sure we continue our activities in afghanistan its what ito would have wanted
9075824 as the person in charge i felt truly sorry for his parents
9075825 its something that kazuya asked a local musician to make for him
9075826 he received it because his activities and work were appreciated
9075827 well temporarily pull japanese staff out but continue our work with local staff as ito would have wanted
9075828 as a parent id like someone to take over his activities but safety is the first priority this continuation of activities should only happen once its been properly established that the area is safe
9075829 should something that is not science be taught in a science class room
9075830 i dont think there should be a prohibition against debate if it comes up in class it doesnt have to be part of the curriculum
9075831 i wont have religion as a litmus test or anybodys personal opinion on evolution or creationism
9075832 i dont think there should be a prohibition against debate if it comes up in class it doesnt have to be part of the curriculum
9075833 in a 2006 gubernatorial debate the soon to be governor of alaska said of evolution and creation education
9075834 while running for governor of alaska palin advocated the teaching of both creationism and evolution in public schools 48 but the next day she said
9075835 i think we can all look forward to the time when these three theories are given equal time in our science classrooms across the country and eventually the world one third time for intelligent design one third time for flying spaghetti monsterism and one third time for logical conjecture based on overwhelming observable evidence
9075836 and whatever happened to separation of church and state in this country
9075837 pinpointed three crucial molecular switches that when flipped completely convert a common cell in the pancreas into the more precious insulin producing ones that diabetics need to survive
9075838 its kind of an extreme makeover of a cell the goal is to create cells that are missing or defective in people its very exciting

9075840 this the governors proposal light we didnt even like the governors proposal
9075841 i would have to agree with senator barack obama last night who said quote in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
9075842 i dont know any kind of negotiation where you say hey lets talk but were not willing to talk about the following things if you went to a marriage counselor and you werent willing to talk about my anger how in the hell are you going to get anywhere
9075843 were tired of waiting its frustrating were running out of money we cant keep our doors open much longer
9075844 if i live to see a black president its gonna be this guy now what was his name again
9075845 but she knows what a bitch she is hey yknow maybe you should be my advocate
9075846 when i had my review i told howie that i wanted to have you be my advocate since id already been using you as a sounding board for ideas advice and so on
9075847 howie said that i should pick someone with more experience because you and i had the same amount of experience
9075848 really so if someone older than me licensed or not wanted me to be their advocate
9075849 i dont think it would carry the weight they wanted

9075858 as for that vp talk all the time ill tell you i still cant answer that question until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the vp does every day
9075859 airline travel is airline travel its been bad for a long time
9075860 i suspect prices will go up fewer people will travel and if youre willing to pay the price it will be fine
9075861 despite this sluggish u s economy the general demand picture is better than it was post 9 11
9075862 in addition you have this consistent response across the board of airlines raising fares and adding fees
9075863 if somebody sees a good fare they should grab it
9075864 the reality is and i dont want to diminish this the industry is going to have to cover its costs
9075865 if there are fewer flights that wont bother me but if flights are really expensive i just wont go or ill go by myself instead of bringing my son and husband
9075866 and then youre good to go you dont have to worry about that
9075867 a very very small number of people would have purchased tickets for travel in september or thereafter before the flights were taken out of the fall schedule in may and june of this year
9075868 i think if oil prices continue to go down you will hear calls for relaxation of fuel surcharges but that doesnt mean they wont hike base airfares
9075869 i dont think most people in every aspect of their trip will notice a difference
9075870 if there is a silver lining it may be that as a result of fewer overall operations they may see better on time performance
9075871 today we are going to examine two high end coolers from thermaltake bigtyp vp and maxorb ex both are actually overhauled versions of their famous predecessors big typhoon and maxorb which formed a positive image in our reviews so it will be very interesting to see how far these new products have gone in the highly competitive layout of forces of high end coolers including other thermaltake products
9075872 a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
9075873 has the record of reform and bipartisanship that others can only speak of
9075874 her experience in shaking up the status quo is exactly what is needed in washington today
9075875 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
9075876 no telling how this turns out but obamas gotta be freaking out today
9075877 tokenism can anyone say with a straight face that palin would have gotten picked if she were a man
9075878 but does anybody really expect her to come out on top of say a foreign policy debate with joe biden
9075879 because mccain picked a hard right pro lifer tied to the oil industry
9075880 her husband was is a commerical fisherman and was is a union steelworker im not saying the oil thing is wrong i just havent seen this in any of the media accounts
9075881 fwiw im guessing that her career contributions from exxonmobil pale in comparison to obamas
9075882 as governor of alaska she has plenty of experience dealing the operating end of oil gas fishing treaties with japan and russia
9075883 a far better choice marci at least illinois is a real state not some wilderness yahoo place with only a few more than zero people living there
9075884 sarah barracuda for leading her high school basketball team to the state championship and in 1984 she won the beauty pageant as well as the title of miss congeniality in her hometown of wasilla alaska
9075885 seems to me this would be a good time to send no strings attached a check for 200 million to iran
9075886 obamas wishful thinkers here learned all they know about alaskan government from talking points memo today
9075887 and she was elected governor in a anybody but murkowski race in which even ted stevens and his son couldnt help their buddy frank
9075888 he picked her because she was a woman and thats it
9075889 when im not working i want to be myself i dont have assistants bodyguards or even a driver because i try to pretend in my own head that this isnt happening

9075901 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
9075902 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
9075903 geoffrey perkins embraced comedy talent to create unique programmes which will be enjoyed for a very long time all of our thoughts are with geoffreys family at this very sad time
9075904 it is an absolute tragedy and our thoughts and prayers are with his family
9075905 there is extensive debris at the site and it will take possibly several weeks to complete this part of the investigation
9075906 we are devastated this just doesnt happen to your own family its like something you see on tv we are all just in limbo at the moment its just hellish having to wait my brother roger is in pieces about the whole thing
9075907 no deposition by the proprietor of the registered estate is to be registered except under a further order
9075908 we are aware that kirstie had a computer and the use of that forms part of the inquiry
9075909 people now have more energy in their later years and realise there is nothing left in their marriage once they have had their career and the children have left home
9075910 people just cant afford to get divorced at the minute
9075911 it could be that husbands will think first before heading for the divorce courts at least until the economic landscape settles particularly as the housing market has been so badly affected in the last few months couples may think twice before divorcing and buying elsewhere
9075912 the reality is that couples split up in all economic climates as we have seen throughout our 70 year history families urgently need easy access to emotional support to manage the fallout from conflict when they separate
9075913 i have just spoken to him and i am hearing that he was fired
9075914 its insane to expect to reform a police department when you dont give them what they need
9075915 for a tiny child the mmr is a ridiculous thing to do it has definitely caused autism
9075916 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
9075917 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
9075918 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
9075919 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
9075920 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
9075921 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
9075922 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
9075923 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
9075924 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
9075925 many pensioners already worrying about whether they can afford to heat their homes this winter will be outraged by news of yet more colossal price hikes
9075926 it is a huge worry that one in three pensioner households are likely to be living in fuel poverty by the end of 2008 and many are already feeling forced to cut back on essential food or fuel
9075927 all the major suppliers have increased prices for a second time this year this is a heavy blow and few households will emerge unscathed or unconcerned about the future affordability of their energy
9075928 these are difficult times and we understand the financial impact this announcement will have on our customers although were one of the last companies to announce increases were sorry we couldnt hold on any longer however we have worked very hard to protect people for as long as possible from these considerable increases in the wholesale market
9075929 extremely reluctantly especially as household budgets are being squeezed so much
9075930 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
9075931 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
9075932 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
9075933 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
9075934 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
9075935 i originally took six weeks off and at the end of six weeks i knew that i didnt really want to start work again this year
9075936 id always planned to leave gardeners world at the end of next year so i just thought ok ill bring it forward by a year i had become entrapped by it in a way that took me ages to realise
9075937 maybe third world countries will have to suffer as a result of our national food policy
9075938 we need to use our horticultural skills which are second to none in the world to grow food
9075939 its really important to get people aware of just how tenuous our food supply really is
9075940 for wealthy middle class people indulging in their penchant for peasant food
9075941 we dont value food in britain so therefore the cheaper it is the better it is we all eat far too much we all pay far too little for our food we have environmental problems we have health problems we have food transport problems
9075942 all one can do in the face of criticism is to say you are entitled to your view but these are things that need to be addressed the enemy or opponent we are taking on
9075943 by far the most dynamic age group growing food is the 28 to 38 year olds which is historically not a gardening age group i think that most people are aware that it takes so much oil and water to produce what theyre eating but the problem is inherent within the solution in so much as you dont want to tell people what to do but you do want to encourage enthuse and inform them
9075944 yes its on the cards due to being ill i put a stop to all work and officially i havent committed myself to anything but the danger is that by being on television you become part of the institution i like the idea of fifth columnists and subversion you dont stand on a podium with a loud hailer telling people what to do which the british absolutely hate youve got to somehow get under the skin of the system and make lots and lots of small changes
9075945 this terrifying disastrous evil has actually usurped and upset the whole system it makes you ask what were they doing right well they just bypassed they stepped aside theyre just not there you need to join together not delegate to a government body
9075946 my experience of working with government has not been fruitful i have to say im not aligned to any party although like many people i feel very disillusioned by the current government but dont feel very hopeful over any alternative power is not the right bit of kit to do this job its about going after the hearts and minds yes there will always be why should this wealthy tv wanker tell me what to do and its not a bad question why should i but i think youve just got to allow people to reject what you say
9075947 its an albatross organic is loaded with a sense of rightness with a set of rules i would much rather someone bought food that was local and sustainable but not organic than bought organic food that had to be shipped across the world weve got to move away from making people feel lesser because theyre not eating organic there is no doubt about it sustainable is a better expression for the same sorts of ideas than organic
9075948 you cant just say its bad because its bad plant breeding has been going on for millennia and its a gradual process at the moment i feel not nearly enough research is being done on the effects of gm and i have no faith at all in the goodwill of the producers and their motives but my overall feeling is that i would not discount anything
9075949 i do feel optimistic but i also feel that im 53 both my parents died in their sixties and youve got to leave this world in a better place that you find it youve got take the fuckers on and not just give in
9075950 we have a number of other major authors across the group
9075951 we have been fortunate enough to have strong cash balances and squander that we will not
9075952 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
9075953 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
9075954 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
9075955 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
9075956 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
9075957 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
9075958 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
9075959 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
9075960 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
9075961 ah its alright i would never complain if a pretty woman like you was standing in front of me
9075962 do what you love and youll never have to work a day in your whole life
9075963 main thing the ad was telling you about brand y

9075967 cleantech group has the best written most informative articles on cleantech ive upgraded my subscription and have been telling others about it keep up the great work
9075968 the market for small tourist ships is quite large in hamburg london amsterdam dubai everywhere
9075969 theres interest in europe for these ships especially in lakes that supply drinking water where you dont want diesel engines running
9075970 we expect to begin discussions soon with potential customers and the price strongly depends on how many systems will be produced
9075971 well try to get five to 10 of these systems developed in the same time frame and then we will be able to get a 50 percent cost reduction
9075972 at at the end of the third reich collapse there was a dash across europe to recover v 2 missiles and components
9075973 as for germany itself the reaction of germany in the aftermath of 9 11 really showed up that when push comes to shove not a lot had changed
9075974 has the record of reform and bipartisanship that others can only speak of
9075975 her experience in shaking up the status quo is exactly what is needed in washington today
9075976 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride

9075981 then he said he wanted to pour yoghurt down between the cheeks of my ar e and then lick it off
9075982 then he said he wanted to turn me upside down fill my p y with stella and then drink it all
9075983 sorry love but im definitely not messing with someone who can drink 15 pints of stella
9075984 how would you like it if you didnt see me for a couple of days

9075987 theres a diagnostic computer down at wal mart just give it a urine sample and the computer will tell you whats wrong and what to do about it it ta kes ten seconds and costs ten dollars a lot cheaper than a doctor

9075997 there are violations that both nicole and madeleine are worried about
9075998 they are matters that i dont believe would rise to the level they would prosecute under the current standards of the u s attorneys office but in this circumstance perhaps theyll ignore their own standards to prosecute madeleine or her daughter to get what they want

9076035 hoosier union members can turn around the state and the nation
9076036 here in indiana were looking at right to work legislation record high job loss and skyrocketing gas prices
9076037 but we have labor friendly candidates today who can make a difference in our every day lives we have candidates like jill long thompson who is an exceptional labor leader for the state of indiana jill is committed to reinstating the collective bargaining rights for state employees and keeping indiana free from right to work for less we have labor friendly statehouse candidates who strongly oppose right to work and will stand strong with union members and we have barack obama who will fight to create an economy that strengthens unions and the middle class
9076038 we have to make sure that we reach out to every single union member in indiana so that they are armed with the facts in november through the labor 2008 program by knocking on doors on labor walks leafleting at work sites participating in member to member phone banks and sending out local union mail were not only making sure that were looking out for ourselves as individuals but were strengthening the labor movement as a whole
9076039 i personally know how important the benefits of the union are and would not vote for any legislation that jeopardized the strength of unions to collectively bargain i am strongly opposed to right to work for less laws because they simply destroy unions and also end up decreasing wages for all workers

9076049 ciertamente la elecci n de palin deja sin efecto el argumento sobre la inexperiencia de la f rmula dem crata aunque la gobernadora es una buena persona su falta de experiencia hace problem tico pensar en ella asumiendo la presidencia
9076050 palin deber reasegurar a los votantes respecto de su solvencia cuando hable frente a la convenci n nacional republicana y cuando debata con biden
9076051 deber llevar la carga de la pol tica exterior y mostrar que goza de buena salud

9076083 no aceptan ni aceptar n ninguna de las condiciones que imponen los de santa martha porque no tienen ese derecho ni la raz n pues la tierra no se vende ni se negocia sino se defiende cuando sabemos que es de nosotros seg n las ley caxlana a los 5 a os obtienen derecho de posesi n pero nuestros compa eros y compa eras tienen derecho de posesi n hace cientos de a os y en la actualidad viven varias familias en el lugar

9076123 sarah palin has foreign policy experience because her state is close to russia
9076124 fox news reports the facts because we have news in the title
9076125 were working hard to elect jill long thompson this year because indiana needs a governor who will stand up for working men and women jill has a proven record of supporting unions and she has promised that her first act as governor will be to reinstate the collective bargaining rights of state workers shes not in favor of mitch daniels plan of privatization and that will make a huge difference when it comes the quality and quantity of jobs here in indiana were making sure that all our members know exactly how she stands and i think its making a huge difference in her campaign
9076126 the reason im out here supporting jill is my sister was a toll road worker she lost her job when mitch decided to privatize they wanted to send her to the prison to work and the license bureau and she had to fight to get a state job back now my 56 year old five foot tall sister works in crown point plowing snow where shes got to do heavy lifting and theyre not represented out there thee safety conditions arent all that good and i know when jill gets elected shell take care of the state workers
9076127 mitch daniels does not support unions or any working families in indiana he has a corporate agenda and hed be happy to get rid of unions if he could
9076128 shell bring back good jobs to indiana by getting rid of privatization hoosiers need that kind of governor

9076160 this database shouldnt just be delayed it should be buried
9076161 instead of delaying the launch of the database this intrusive project must be scrapped altogether
9076162 a recent independent review has already undermined all of the governments assurances that the database will be secure
9076163 the discovery of further technical issues does not bode well for the future the government has proven itself untrustworthy with large databases containing sensitive data

9076174 there was a large amount and i know we have been working around the clock
9076175 but we havent taken over the customer base or anything like that
9076176 it is a business led by consumer demand and as consumer spending power has weakened amtraks business has suffered
9076177 we are currently assessing the financial situation of the business and as a result the collection and delivery of goods may be disrupted
9076178 with a lot of foreclosures on the market you have so many houses that are being broken into vandalized people are stealing the appliances plus theyre running down

9076210 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity

9076219 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
9076220 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus

9076224 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
9076225 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
9076226 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
9076227 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
9076228 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
9076229 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
9076230 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
9076231 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
9076232 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
9076233 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
9076234 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
9076235 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
9076236 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
9076237 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
9076238 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
9076239 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
9076240 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
9076241 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
9076242 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
9076243 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
9076244 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
9076245 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
9076246 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
9076247 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
9076248 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
9076249 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
9076250 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds

9076412 congratulations to john mccain and the republican party for putting a woman on the ticket only 24 years after the democrats did thats less time than it usually takes them to catch up
9076413 and too bad that the republicans also imitated the democrats in coming up with a grossly under qualified woman especially now when there are some fully qualified alternatives

9076422 el prestigio de las misiones de observaci n electoral de la oea determina que los pueblos y los electores est n tranquilos en este proceso y se respete debidamente la voluntad popular expresada en las urnas ese es en definitiva el mandato del pueblo
9076423 el ecuador es muy central dentro de la organizaci n y dentro de am rica del sur y est llevando adelante un proceso de cambio y transformaci n institucional muy fundamental
9076424 en esta oportunidad nos va a acompa ar como l der de la mesa electoral el ex presidente de costa rica rodrigo carazo y vamos a tener una misi n de pocos observadores pero muy coordinada con la organizaci n de estados americanos
9076425 ellos van a observar el proceso electoral que es muy importante para el estado ecuatoriano
9076426 en ese sentido creo que el esfuerzo de esta administraci n va justamente enfocado a que podamos mejorar la calidad considerando que todos quienes van a ser parte del magisterio cumplan con un m nimo de caracter sticas y un m nimo de calidad para poder atender en los servicios educativos
9076427 porque hay plazas de todo el proceso de jubilaci n es decir en estos pr ximos meses se incorporan al magisterio 20 mil nuevas personas
9076428 hubo una prueba de razonamiento l gico y verbal hubo una prueba de conocimientos generales una tercera prueba de conocimientos espec ficos de acuerdo a la materia que aplicaba cada uno de los aspirantes a docentes y justamente en el mes de septiembre estamos cerrando el proceso de evaluaci n con las clases demostrativas
9076429 esto es la parte pr ctica donde el aspirante a docente puede demostrar ante la comunidad educativa cu les son sus destrezas pedag gicas
9076430 justamente en lo que es l gica matem tica y lenguaje y yo creo que una vez que se publiquen los resultados vamos a darnos cuentas que si quienes estamos como docentes tenemos debilidad en estas reas obviamente esto repercute en la calidad de educaci n que tienen los ni os porque los ni os tambi n denotan esas mismas debilidades una vez que son evaluados
9076431 el mes de septiembre es como un mes de innovaciones pedag gicas donde todos estos aspirantes a docentes est n utilizando sus mayores capacidades para ingresar al magisterio porque obviamente va a ser una evaluaci n la idea es que en cada establecimiento educativo en donde se han asignado partidas el director que es quien preside el jurado de la comunidad educativa organice todas sus clases demostrativas de forma de todos los estudiantes puedan de cierta forma participar en este proceso de la clase demostrativa pero adem s yo creo que lo m s interesante de este proceso es que quienes participan son la comunidad educativa por ello se establece que es el jurado de la comunidad educativa quien califica esta parte del proceso
9076432 para nosotros esta es una forma de transparentar los resultados que no exista ninguna interferencia ninguna subjetividad en la calificaci n
9076433 el objetivo de hacer este an lisis comparativo que en realidad no est subyugado a ninguna posici n pol tica el objetivo primordial ha sido poner a disposici n de la ciudadan a ecuatoriana herramientas para que tomen una posici n fija
9076434 esa no es tampoco nuestra posici n tal vez indirectamente se pueda llegar a esa conclusi n pero nosotros de ninguna manera queremos ser un referente para que la ciudadan a vote no
9076435 tenemos una versi n pre comisi n de redacci n y una post entre las competencias que se le da a esta comisi n de redacci n est incluir omisiones obvias establecer contradicciones e incluso cuestiones de terminolig a la comparaci n no quiere decir que se han extralimitado o no porque en tal caso la asamblea constituyente al votar ratific eso lo legitim
9076436 queremos evidenciar con este trabajo cuales son las diferencias jur dicas que se han presentando lo que nosotros queremos es resaltar las agregaciones y derogaciones de los textos
9076437 en el art culo 130 del ltimo proyecto presentado se agregan dos causales por la cuales la asamblea nacional puede destituir al presidente de la rep blica en el proyecto del 19 de julio no contaba que se puede destituir al presidente de la rep blica por haber cometido delitos contra la seguridad del estado y por delitos de cohecho peculado y enriquecimiento il cito y esas desaparecen en el proyecto
9076438 en realidad si lo puede ser pero no podr an la asamblea nacional destituirlo por juicio pol tico si el presidente es acusado o juzgado perder a el ejerci de derechos pol ticos y por tanto no podr a ejercer la presidencia de la rep blica por ello esto podr a ser una diferencia jur dicamente l gica
9076439 en el art culo 132 del proyecto del 24 de julio agrega dos casos m s en los cuales se requerir ley en el caso de regular el ejercicio de los derechos de garant as constitucionales y atribuir deberes competencias a los rganos aut nomos descentralizados estos dos casos que requer an de la expedici n de una ley no fueron contemplados en el proyecto del 19 de julio
9076440 para elegir jueces y juezas de la corte nacional no se establec a en el proyecto del 19 de julio un procedimiento y la comisi n para el del 24 lo agrego se entender a que si no se estipula esto se lo delegar a la ley y despu s ratificado por la asamblea fija un procedimiento y crea un marco por la ley
9076441 dice las juezas y jueces ser n elegidos por el consejo de la judicatura conforme a un procedimiento de oposici n y m rito impugnaci n y control social se propenda a la paridad entre hombre y mujer
9076442 establec a que los consejeros y consejeras principales y suplentes de consejo de participaci n ciudadana durar an cinco a os en sus funciones
9076443 ya no se establece no ponen un termino de duraci n de sus funciones y como tal queda redactado
9076444 en el juicio pol tico seg n la primera versi n la sanci n por la asamblea nacional era causal de destituci n para los ministros era una sanci n definitiva en el ltimo proyecto ya no aparece esto queda la censura pero queda a discrecionalidad del presidente de la rep blica la destituci n
9076445 el art culo 422 del 19 de julio dice que se debe ratificar los tratados por iniciativa ciudadana o por el presidente de la rep blica y la realizaci n de una consulta popular o refer ndum para la ratificaci n de estos tratados en el proyecto del 24 de julio la ratificaci n de los tratados se podr pedir exclusivamente por refer ndum por iniciativa ciudadana o por presidente de la rep blica eliminan la consulta popular
9076446 en el proyecto del 19 de julio la disposici n transitoria primera determina que en un plazo de 180 d as contados desde la entrada de vigencia de la constituci n aprobar a la ley que desarrolla el r gimen de soberan a alimentaria en el proyecto del 24 de julio se reduce ese t rmino o ese plazo de 180 a 120 d as y adem s de la expedici n de la ley agregaron otras en los 120 d as tienen que expedir el congresillo antes de las elecciones de la asamblea nacional la ley electoral la ley regulatoria de funci n judicial del consejo de la judicatura y la ley que regula el consejo de participaci n ciudadana y control social
9076447 cuando tuvimos el primer texto del 19 de julio comenzamos a hacer el estudio comparativo con la constituci n del 98 y esa era nuestro primer an lisis y all bamos a para nuestro trabajo no obstante al momento de ingresar de nuevo a la p gina de la asamblea encontramos otro texto
9076448 mientras en el pa s la gran mayor a estamos apasionadamente debatiendo el tema de la constituci n entre ellos el tema del aborto del matrimonio gay y el r gimen de transici n aqu hay otro r gimen de transici n hasta el 28 de septiembre el d a en que vamos a votar no s nulo o abstenernos hasta el 28 de septiembre al parecer hay un impacto que no se visibiliza pero que se siente con las grandes compa as trasnacionales de este gobierno para negociar renegociar y adjudicar los grandes contratos millonarios en explotaci n de recursos naturales
9076449 en el art culo 8 del proyecto de constituci n condenar a y obligar a a las personas que explotan recursos naturales a participar en un cincuenta por ciento por lo menos de lo que reciban entonces aqu hay algo perverso cual es la urgencia del gobierno de rafael correa para entregar a dedo millonarios contratos
9076450 primero en el contrato de porta celular no pod an esperar un poco para despu s de aprobada la constituci n ver con qu nuevo marco jur dico y constitucional trabajar ellos pod an extender el contrato un mes o dos meses por responsabilidad hasta que se apruebe la nueva constituci n
9076451 ese contrato es nulo y perjudicial para el pa s porque no solo se firm o se renegoci el contrato de 850 mhz sino que se le adjudic la
9076452 primero se entrega a dedo la s smica en el golfo y se entrega a enap de chile y a pdvesa de venezuela la explotaci n de gas en el golfo a dedo porque no hay licitaci n y es lo b sico en el sector p blico la emergencia en petroecuador es injustificada e ilegal se adjudica a dedo para qu est el proceso licitatorio es para poder calificar y medir las ofertas t cnicas y econ micas
9076453 las joyas de la corona sacha auca shushufindi libertador y coronaco el presidente dispone entregar firmemente los contratos sacha dice no le toquen porque ya esta entregado a pdvesa y van a entregar a trav s de una empresa de econom a mixta que no est en la ley
9076454 la empresa r o napo que va a conformarse en una empresa de papel entre petroecuador y pdvesa para explotar un campo en producci n para m es humillante ver las declaraciones en ecuadorinmediato del ministro de minas estamos entregando un campo en producci n con 45 mil barriles por d a 500 millones de barriles de reservas de crudo liviano 50 mil millones de d lares en reservas y de eso le damos el 30 a una compa a de papel de venezuela son 15 mil millones de d lares a cambio de una inversi n anual de 24 millones de d lares
9076455 los otros campos de las joyas de la corona se lo van a entregar a schlumberger y a halliburton
9076456 yo tengo documentos habr tiempo para revelar como desde la presidencia de la rep blica se habr a inducido a que se entregue el campo auca a la compa a schlumberger
9076457 es una resoluci n del directorio la funcionario de la presidencia la se orita sandra naranjo hace una exposici n y reclama al directorio por qu no han cumplido esto con base a eso el directorio se mueve y toma una resoluci n
9076458 entregan las joyas de la corona est en proceso por eso quiero advertir y muchos sectores estamos en eso este procedimiento es ilegal las autoridades de petroecuador que suscriban estos contratos alg n momento aqu se recuperara el estado de derecho las autoridades que firmen los informes y contratos est n incurriendo en delitos civiles y penales
9076459 si el presidente de petroecuador firma los contratos bajo una modalidad que no existe en la ley de hidrocarburos el contrato de obras y bienes espec ficos estar a incurriendo en un delito m s temprano que tarde recuperamos el derecho y correa no estar todo el tiempo en el pa s
9076460 la ley de hidrocarburos se ala que en nico organismo responsable para facilitar estos proyectos es el comit especial de licitaciones integrado por ministro de minas la ministra de econom a y finanzas y el ministro de defensa es el sel que tiene que elegir la licitaci n fuera de petroecuador
9076461 yo tengo un mail del ex presidente fernando zurita en donde dice que denuncie que el se or jos luis serit representante del presidente correa en el directorio presionaba para que se divida al campo pungarayacu en dos uno para ivanhoe y otra para otra empresa canadiense y dice que el presidente correa dispuso que sea solo para ivanhoe
9076462 mejorar el crudo de pungarayacu es terrible los niveles de contaminaci n son insoportables y alt simos es un crudo extremadamente pesado
9076463 entregan oglan a enarsa una empresa de papel nunca han perforado un pozo son empresas de papel atr s de la empresa de papel est n empresas privadas argentinas como el caso de coca codo sinclair
9076464 uno de los elementos y las causales del desastre del proyecto san francisco es que los estudios con los que se construy y con los que se va a construir coca codo sinclair fueron hechos por el ex inecel
9076465 se tomaron los estudios cuando no hab an explotado el volc n tungurahua
9076466 pero que le permite adjudicar a dedo a coca codo sinclair porque hidropichincha es s a y no se sujeta a los procedimiento contractuales del estado
9076467 a trav s de petroamazonas se piensa adjudicar el m s grande proyecto de crudos pesados del pa s que se llama itt a petrobras
9076468 la destrucci n interna de su organismo es mucho m s que un simple esfuerzo
9076469 los ciudadanos tienen la libertad absoluta de hacer lo que realmente ellos crean conveniente si quieren elegir un s a un cambio que muchas de las ocasiones que nos han tenido en una situaci n bastante adversa vayan por el s sin embargo si es que van por el s no es que la responsabilidad va a terminar el momento que sufraguemos el s sino va a iniciar la responsabilidad porque esta nueva forma de constituci n es responsabilidad de todos no esperemos que vamos a delegar la responsabilidad a que las autoridades hagan los cambios de nuestra naci n eso no va a ser posible todos vamos a trabajar de manera conjunta para que ese cambio que estamos deseando realmente sea eficiente realmente se pueda hacer
9076470 tambi n hay las otras personas que tienen la libertad para decir no no quiero una nueva constituci n y esas personas que no quieren una nueva constituci n seguramente estar n conscientes de los grandes errores que tuvimos en el pasado y que bajo ninguna circunstancia pueden volver a suceder ahora entonces s creo que tenemos la libertad para que cualquier ciudadano realmente elija lo que ellos crean conveniente
9076471 mi mensaje a la poblaci n a la naci n a la gente a los ciudadanos a los j venes es que tus sue os tus anhelos no se cumplen en un a o o en dos a os a m dios me dio el talento para ser el mejor marchista del mundo qu falta de modestia pero tengo que decirlo honestamente dios me dio ese talento sin embargo tuve que trabajar durante doce a os para tener mi segunda medalla ol mpica
9076472 para hacer cambios en nuestra vida cumplir nuestros sue os nuestros anhelos no va ser en uno dos o tres a os van a ser en doce quince veinte a os o probablemente en nuestra generaci n no vamos a ver esos beneficios del cambio probablemente van a ver nuestras futuras generaciones
9076473 tengo una participaci n en espa a que es m s por un compromiso adquirido con anterioridad en el cual el resultado nada tiene que ver con mi vida deportiva entonces vamos ir a participar all
9076474 creo que es la gran oportunidad que estuve esperando para irme a una ciudad en la cual existe la mayor concentraci n de migrantes ecuatorianos como es murcia el 21 de septiembre entonces voy a tener la oportunidad de homenajearles a ellos de decirles a ellos gracias
9076475 press to play holds a special place in my heart but really did he actually think this song would be a successful single
9076476 el gobierno no traicion el mandato de su pueblo que apuesta por una nueva constituci n pol tica del estado
9076477 quienes critican al gobierno por esta medida son voces aisladas y desesperadas porque ven la inminente p rdida del poder mal habido que hubo en muchas familias clanes logias y con un estado excluyente fascista oligarca corrupto y terrateniente
9076478 un estado que fue fundado por los doctores de charcas cuya visi n qued agotada en la medida que el pueblo quiere cambi vot por el cambio y nosotros consideramos que ese es el fondo de la preocupaci n y seguramente lanzar n como advirti el presidente muchas cosas contra el proceso
9076479 si no hubi ramos lanzado la medida ser a una traici n a la voluntad del pueblo que el 10 de agosto apoyo al presidente evo morales
9076480 lo que se debe hacer ahora es ir a la defensa del proyecto de constituci n elegir a los consejeros departamentales dos prefectos cochabamba y la paz y subprefectos para que gane la democracia y el pueblo tenga autoridad leg tima
9076481 estamos iniciando una campa a a nivel nacional para garantizar la aprobaci n de la nueva cpe como lo hicimos con la ratificaci n del presidente de la rep blica evo morales
9076482 mucho se podr decir sobre bolivia mucho se podr escribir se podr n decir muchas cosas por la prensa pero de la vocaci n democr tica del pueblo boliviano y de su gobierno nunca se escribir lo suficiente
9076483 en raz n de las tareas realizadas la misi n quiere reiterar su valoraci n positiva sobre el proceso electoral del referendo
9076484 ninguno de ellos puede desconocer que el fruto de su triunfo en el referendo debe ser en beneficio de la unidad nacional
9076485 muy buena voluntad con mucho afecto y con mucho agradecimiento
9076486 que nos piden que nosotros sigamos en un esfuerzo de facilitaci n del di logo
9076487 creemos que como todas estas autoridades son leg timas el entendimiento es entonces la nica forma para que bolivia pueda salir airosa
9076488 no solamente para aprobar su constituci n que es algo tan necesario tan bueno sino tambi n para poder poner l mites a las desigualdades y para poder tener paz y armon a en una sociedad en la que tengan cabida todos los bolivianos
9076489 llamamos a todas las organizaciones departamentales regionales y provinciales a elegir a sus candidatos para subprefectos con el objeto de asegurar una gesti n productiva para cada uno de sus sectores
9076490 a los senadores les pedimos que reflexionen sobre su actitud y recomendarles que el capricho no lleva a un buen camino y es traicionero les pedimos que trabajen a favor de los pobres
9076491 estamos realizando todas las investigaciones necesarias y pronto sabremos los resultados
9076492 lo que quiero manifestar ante los medios de comunicaci n es que habi ndose evidenciado en este acto se trata de material b lico que se utiliza en la guerra y antimotines por tanto no pueden ser utilizados por gente civil
9076493 cascos de seguridad de motociclistas y l minas de policarbonato
9076494 por los modelos que veo los cascos son diferentes a los de motociclistas
9076495 he sido amenazado y he sufrido muchos atentados en mi casa con granadas de guerra disparos intentos de secuestro y este ltimo atentado contra mi vida es porque vinieron a lincharme pero hasta ahora no hay respuesta de la justicia espero que en este ltimo caso se obre con responsabilidad
9076496 una banda de fascistas intolerantes que no pueden asumir que el pueblo boliviano se ha decidido por el cambio
9076497 la violencia responde a la intolerancia y por la decisi n del pueblo que a trav s del voto mayoritario y aplastante ha decidido continuar con el proceso de cambio el fascismo no telera eso y no tolera la expresi n del 10 de agosto
9076498 esa es la actitud habitual de los fascistas la intolerancia se ha apoderado de gente desquiciada que no puede asumir que el pueblo quiere un cambio
9076499 estamos convocando a un ampliado nacional para el mi rcoles de la siguiente semana para informar a todos los sectores sociales del pa s el decreto supremo y delinear el trabajo para la campa a que iniciaremos el 13 de septiembre
9076500 vamos a enviar una nota al fiscal general de la rep blica mario uribe para que en el marco de sus atribuciones pueda tomar las acciones que correspondan para procesar y sancionar en caso necesario la comisi n de estos delitos
9076501 el responsable es la persona que ha cometido el delito entonces el ministerio p blico tendr que iniciar la investigaci n y determinar quienes son los autores los c mplices e ir al proceso para sancionarlos
9076502 toda persona que promueva la interrupci n de las actividades a que se refiere el art culo 31 de la ley de hidrocarburos ser sancionado conforme a lo establecido en el articulo 214 del c digo penal
9076503 el transporte y comercializaci n de hidrocarburos es un servicio p blico por tanto actos desarrollados que violan este servicio se constituyen en un delitos penal
9076504 el desaf o es actuar juntos para que la interdicci n de estos il citos tr fico de estupefacientes armas y contrabando sea eficaz como ocurre en la zona fronteriza de desaguadero con la participaci n coordinada entre las fuerzas armadas y polic a
9076505 se debe mejorar el cruce de informaci n e inteligencia para identificar los peligros y las amenazas que siempre existen y l gicamente hay que trabajar mucho m s acorde entre los dos pa ses para enfrentar estos graves flagelos
9076506 igual como la ciencia y la tecnolog a avanz esa misma ciencia avanz para actividades il citas como la delincuencia cibern tica cada vez es m s dif cil detectar como pasa la droga de un pa s a otro en consecuencia tenemos que utilizar sistemas m s modernos
9076507 te doy protecci n al narcotr fico y tu me das algunos estipendios
9076508 se realizar inmediatamente una auditor a de la anterior administraci n
9076509 one thing that is badly missing in pakistan is investor confidence
9076510 the global financial crunch rising commodity prices and the local political situation has affected the macroeconomic picture
9076511 and that is reflected in the stock money and currency markets
9076512 you know what i want to do whatever we are going to do now lets take a trip visit some friends and maybe well figure something out because im not happy in my position
9076513 lets plan a trip and get out of dodge lets change our views
9076514 well youre not really up to par if you havent been to whatever
9076515 you have to take the boxes out of the van this way
9076516 why dont you listen to me when i tell you to do something
9076517 ah there are exposed to the astonishment of every week and the train in motion the balloon in england was in paris the more their whole womanhood is educated to employ its powers without waste and without haste in harmonious unity the tech sheet flooring and next sharers of the milk white lamb a tech sheet flooring by separate brigade the 8th was formed as a warlock
9076518 i cannot help thinking too that tech sheet flooring took their horses who seemed to be nominated tech sheet flooring keep
9076519 i got something to do the feathered boughs of some importance
9076520 at what period a man of to day and render scotland the very early experimental days
9076521 i have beheld with most of tech sheet flooring from the picture before tech sheet flooring in trouble too
9076522 seeing the sights of la chance tech sheet flooring suppose
9076523 michelle do you think god was trying to get your attention about your addiction
9076524 there was no indication on the putting green when i was warming up that was going to tell me it was going to be like that
9076525 it just felt normal just one of those days where i made about a 15 footer on the first hole another on the second hole i just kind of built on that momentum
9076526 i just tried to keep the pedal down because i knew the scores were pretty low
9076527 its been kind of my goal the last moth or so to get off to better starts in tournaments
9076528 it seems like ive been having to come from behind ive just put it in my to try to get off to a better start obviously this was way exceeding my expectations
9076529 its nuts i dont think theyve got it right quite yet
9076530 how can you have a double major winner not make the tour championship thats complete nonsense
9076531 it was one of the rare days it did feel like that
9076532 but it was one of those days with my putter i hadnt had in a while so it was fun
9076533 i just dont feel any pressure out there at the moment
9076534 i was holding him laying in bed with him when he died
9076535 my son michael called and he was wonderful hes coming home to be with me for a fews days i spoke to ali and cody too im hoping they will come to the wake i asked her if shes going to be at the wake but it sounds like dina is discouraging her from going shes deterring her from going to the wake to the funeral i said its only right that you go but dina hasnt called absolutely not shes too busy out having fun in the hamptons
9076536 its absolutely amazing we thought chancellor would be the first black president
9076537 this is a really big part of history and to witness this to be able to say i was here on this day its cool
9076538 i never thought in my wildest dreams that a day like this would come to pass and i would not have missed it for all the tea in china
9076539 its just a once in a lifetime thing im hoping he remembers some of it but hell have pictures to look back on he may experience it backwards but he could say he was here
9076540 denvers been great for kids ive felt very safe here and its been very well organized and lots of fun
9076541 its a historic moment hopefully it will inspire them to a life of public service
9076542 we took them out of school because its significant someday theyll look back and be thankful someday it will sink in and theyll thank us for taking them to this were just doing our job
9076543 im here to see obama because obamas awesome and i want to rub it in my sisters faces
9076544 having grown up in a small wyoming town i never would have imagined 30 years ago what were seeing today a black man being nominated for president no one would believe it would happen but thats the world that my 11 year old daughter is growing up in and thats amazing
9076545 think battery acid and seawater mixed together and thats what we have in some parts of southern inland queensland
9076546 we think the potential for developing acid is throughout the whole landscape theres nothing to tell us otherwise and we have lots of evidence to tell us it is already happening
9076547 in many of those areas they are in close proximity to major watercourses major rivers important wetlands and so on so we are quite concerned
9076548 the environmental people are going to have to start thinking about doing a bit of triage were not in a position to prop up all the assets we want
9076549 if that debate isnt had then as things become critical no one will be able to deal with it
9076550 without a single co ordinated approach on a catchment scale it will be an ongoing slow process to find the right solutions
9076551 it certainly is emerging as one of the major inland problems in the current times just because of the lack of water compounded by severe drought conditions potentially climate change water extraction and modification to the water regime
9076552 wherever they are found they have the potential to do enormous damage if they are mismanaged
9076553 se trata de la solicitud de poder umts que hac a el iphone y resultaba excesivo para lo que en realidad requer a causando que la torre de se al se quedara corta de energ a entre tantas solicitudes
9076554 look when most people woke up this morning they didnt know who sarah palin was
9076555 shes a hunter a lifetime nra member a hockey mom she plays hockey flies an alaskan float plane her husband is an eskimo she has an 80 percent approval rating in alaska where they dont make much bs out of their politicians
9076556 i think its kind of an insult to women for the mccain campaign to assume if they nominate a woman all the women are going to stampede away from the obama biden ticket
9076557 this is a fascinating bold and someone risky choice for john mccain

9076588 me parece un avance en la constituci n que el h beas corpus ahora pase a la funci n judicial que son los jueces los que definen el habeas corpus este ha sido ya un requerimiento inclusive internacional al ecuador puesto que en la mayor parte de los pa ses son los jueces los que deciden el habeas corpus ya que est n en mejor capacidad de hacerlo
9076589 est m s claro que los fueros policiales o militares tienes que ver como contravenciones disciplinarias al interior de la instituci n por lo que el delito pasa a tribunales comunes me parece que es otro avance

9076597 i love composing and the whole thing but i am also raising my children and enjoying it and teaching them to ride bicycles and how to read i love it
9076598 i get pretty emotional when i see them having a wonderful time
9076599 when they are on a ride and they are screaming and they are happy it makes me emotional cause i see they are having a real good time
9076600 i let them go to the arcade and go to the movies and do things i want them to get to do the kind of things i didnt get to do so i fill them with a lot of enjoy that way a lot of amusement you know

9076602 im thinking more about the ryder cup than this to be honest with you
9076603 im trying to get my game ready for that being my first ryder cup i want to play well and represent our country to the best of my ability
9076604 if we win that would be great if not at least i go there and had a great time knowing that i gave it my all thats all you can do
9076605 i mean theres no other way to see it it was a disaster
9076606 oh sorry you didnt have enough damage and just move on
9076607 they could have done so much good for so many people for such a relatively modest amount of money and they left us hanging
9076608 we thought fema would step up and do what they are supposed to be doing for all people
9076609 but they didnt do that so now were going to have to compensate for it i think were going to move fast
9076610 and this is the kind of money taxpayers want to spend it on helping people
9076611 all that money will be dedicated to people by three independent people who im selecting

9076619 placing a show on sale at a particular date and time lends itself to unfair use of automated ticket buying programs our process will ensure a fair and equitable means for all of mileys fans to have a chance to buy tickets
9076620 consumers should expect very few tickets to be sold to the public for this casino show less than half the tickets that the venue has and the least desirable tickets
9076621 connecticut attorney general richard blumenthal attempted to make the practice of withholding so many tickets illegal in the last legislative session but met stringent opposition from s lobbyist
9076622 it appears as if miley cyrus is attempting to create hype of her tour by exploiting fans in connecticut by playing in an arena that holds roughly 25 percent of the hartford civic center and projected hold back of many tickets
9076623 this hype will serve her well at the expense of the least educated live entertainment fans
9076624 there is no way to exactly determine when a sell out will occur
9076625 but your chances are still better with our process than with more traditional ticketing processes
9076626 may your hands be forever blessed in friendship and your hearts joined forever in love
9076627 we certainly think that now that were in there hopefully we can give it a good shake
9076628 they can say what they want we know as a club that on our day we can probably beat anyone and i think weve proven that throughout the year
9076629 the leg is coming along nicely didnt get up for this week but as you say hopefully get up for next week
9076630 i certainly think my chances are right up there hopefully get out and have a good week on the track
9076631 finals football in our case is going to be cut throat one loss and youre out one win and you get another chance

9076633 i want josh to stay but you understand sometimes there are issues players have to deal with
9076634 josh was the captain tonight and we will know the outcome of him in the next couple of days
9076635 we will do as much as we can to get him to stay but if its beyond what we can do or offer the decision is out of our control
9076636 we will sit down with jeff in the next couple of days he was very lively tonight and looked like he was playing for his life
9076637 he is an inner strength at our club especially to the aboriginal guys and i cant speak highly enough of him as a player
9076638 obviously we are disappointed that we wont be playing our first football game of the season on sept 4

9076647 junior year in high school i think we had just overall one of the best teams thats ever come through mechanicsburg school in a while
9076648 it kind of breaks down to there were no cliques everyone was hanging out with one another on and off the field and then when we were on the field we just knew what everyone was doing i had a great bunch of receivers a great line and everything like that so it worked out
9076649 it was a little disappointing but i still had fun
9076650 so what we didnt have as much talent as we did the previous year but everyone was still putting in the same amount of effort and more
9076651 at the time it looked like a great opening i mean brady quinn was leaving and i was thinking hey ive got a shot go in redshirt for a year sit behind quinn and learn from him and then in the fall i would get in there that was my mindset going in
9076652 at the time it was because it had great facilities great coaches everything like that but at the same time im only 17 still young not really knowing whats going on im not really seeing the big picture im just seeing notre dame wow ive got to go there
9076653 i think you just get caught up in the whole recruiting mess and thats why you commit early even though you dont really have to
9076654 everyone was shooting for that spot because with quinn leaving everyone knew it was open and with clausen coming in everyone was hyped about him and everything like that
9076655 you could definitely feel the tension between everyone because we all were very competitive but i really i stay laid back in situations like that its just my personality
9076656 i didnt think he weis would say what he did but then again hes the coach its his team and thats what he wanted so i took it how it was and i moved on i said hey im going to try and make the best out of my life so thats what i did and thats when i decided to transfer
9076657 we were very pleased that when zach decided to leave notre dame that we were going to be a school he was going to consider
9076658 and we knew him from high school we recruited him out of high school and really liked what we saw and then knowing we had another opportunity at him excited us and were very glad that we landed him
9076659 i actually used to recruit the harrisburg area of pennsylvania a lot so id been to his high school many times and i knew his high school coach very well
9076660 i knew zach back when he was in high school and i knew a bunch of coaches in the league that respected him not just as a player but as a person i knew what kind of guy we were getting
9076661 i feel like im still playing for mechanicsburg just that type of feel thats what you need so were all laughing i mean you see it were all laughing and everyones a team
9076662 i knew it was going to happen but it was just like no i cant sit out another year
9076663 but you know i tried to take it as a kind of helping myself produce and helping myself learn the offense better here
9076664 right now tyler lorenzen is our starting quarterback but zach is the backup and zach knows that in one play he might have to go in and play
9076665 im hoping that hell be able to play because hes the backup and id like to develop another quarterback and develop him and get him in there to get some reps so right now well see how everything goes but if he continues to progress and if he keeps doing the things that we tell him he should do i think hell get his chance to get some playing time this year
9076666 its a dream come true coming out of high school you want to go to college you want to play ball and then in the future you want to make it to the nfl but right now im working on playing in college and i cant wait for that

9076670 on tax policy alaska governor sarah palin has a rather uninspiring albeit brief record the following is some information gleaned from state tax notes
9076671 palin supported and signed into law a 1 5 billion tax increase on oil companies in the form of higher severance taxes one rule of thumb is that higher taxes cause less investment sure enough
9076672 after aces was passed conocophillips alaskas most active oil exploration company and one of the top three producers announced it was canceling plans to build a diesel fuel refinery at the kuparuk oil field conocophillips blamed the cancellation on passage of aces the new tax the refinery would have allowed the company to produce low sulfur diesel fuel onsite for its vehicles and other uses on the north slope rather than haul the fuel there from existing refineries

9076674 as the olympics wind down i am amazed at how things change every four years many americans were glued to their televisions to watch the excitement from beijing and also heard announcers wax nostalgic with memories of times when the soviet union was the usas biggest competitor for olympic gold there was a time when it was unthinkable that a government as powerful as that of the soviet unions could possibly crumble yet crumble it did

9076695 for instance suppose a prisoner finds out another prisoner has money or other assets they might find themselves coerced into a marriage with a more powerful inmate who might try to lay claim to half their assets
9076696 the law requires they treat people the same so thats a good principle to have in mind when they are drafting regulations

9076804 the american psychological association has recognized terry tracey for his distinguished scholarship and impactful contributions to the field of counseling psychology by presenting him with two of the associations most prestigious awards
9076805 his tireless support and passionate commitment to the profession of counseling psychology and to the education of its future leaders is legendary at asu and across the country i can think of no other individual more deserving of the apas presidential citation and tyler award than our distinguished colleague and friend professor tracey
9076806 terry tracey is an outstanding scholar who is internationally recognized for his empirical and theoretical contributions to counseling psychology including the areas of interpersonal aspects of behavior and personality non cognitive predictors of college success and the development of vocational and other interests
9076807 interest is a neglected area because we tend to over focus on competence

9076816 we had an extraordinary group of nominees for this award
9076817 those nominated and those finally selected as outstanding graduate mentors consistently demonstrated not only excellence in their scholarship and teaching but also in their enormous commitment to the development and success of their students they have clearly impacted the lives of their students in significant ways

9076820 their successes are the best rewards that i could ever want
9076821 like parenting successful graduate mentoring requires different intellectual investments at different developmental phases
9076822 when students finally master the basics of clear thinking they face the most difficult steps learning to communicate their ideas to journal editors to grant panels to curious undergraduates and to journalists curious about the latest scientific findings and each of these audiences wants them to speak in a different language
9076823 professor kenrick is among our most popular graduate mentors and is one of the major draws to the social psychology program at asu his reputation alone recruits students and then his true dedication to their success makes him a prized mentor
9076824 his students have tremendous success across many facets of their graduate careers but none is so clear as is their success in publication and placement in outstanding jobs when they finish
9076825 this years nominees demonstrated a very high level of dedication to the success of their students
9076826 the impact that excellent mentoring can have on a graduate career was consistently affirmed by past and current students who provided important input into the final selection of this years awardees

9077062 theyre actually jumping away from our swatter because they take the time to plan their escape
9077063 this illustrates how rapidly the flys brain can process sensory information into an appropriate motor response
9077064 we also found that when the fly makes planning movements prior to takeoff it takes into account its body position at the time it first sees the threat
9077065 when it first notices an approaching threat a flys body might be in any sort of posture depending on what it was doing at the time like grooming feeding walking or courting our experiments showed that the fly somehow knows whether it needs to make large or small postural changes to reach the correct preflight posture this means that the fly must integrate visual information from its eyes which tell it where the threat is approaching from with mechanosensory information from its legs which tells it how to move to reach the proper preflight pose
9077066 is transformed into an appropriate pattern of leg and body motion prior to take off
9077067 this is a rather sophisticated sensory to motor transformation and the search is on to find the place in the brain where this happens

9077109 certainly its very easy to look at the vampires as metaphors for gays and lesbians
9077110 but its very easy to see them as metaphors for all kinds of things if this story had been done 50 years ago it would be a metaphor for racial equality
9077111 a metaphor for the terrors of intimacy thats one of the reasons vampires have been such a potent metaphor and mythological motif for centuries they show up in pretty much all cultures its the notion of separating that part which keeps us safe and separate from another person both emotionally and physically and how there is a certain loss of self that takes place when there is true intimacy and i think thats really healthy but it doesnt mean its not scary

9077130 obama is increasingly coming across as an empty suit an ambitious phony with a dubious background biden is just another stock liberal
9077131 i only come prepared with one question to an interview
9077132 well i guess my personal site because it has some flash and that was tough
9077133 when acura announced in 2006 its intentions to join the american le mans series advancement to lmp1 was one of the first questions many asked
9077134 we are delighted to see that acura and honda performance development have answered that question especially because they have done it in such a powerful and positive way
9077135 now comes the next logical step with its move to lmp1
9077136 competing head to head on a direct level with such prototype powers like audi is a formidable task but this year has shown that acura and its teams are more than up to the challenge
9077137 just as noteworthy is the signal that acuras lmp1 project does not mean the end of its lmp2 program
9077138 i know hpd and acura have unfinished business in the class and are keen to finish the job both this season and next their decision to compete in both classes is the perfect definition of a win win situation for the american le mans series and our fans they can expect to see a continuation of the epic competition that has become a hallmark of the lmp2 class while at the same time anticipate a significant increase in the competition and content in lmp1
9077139 we look forward to the challenge competing in the lmp1 class and putting acura at the forefront
9077140 since launching the acura american le mans series program in 2007 our goal has always been to compete at the highest level of sports car racing
9077141 the lmp1 class of the american le mans series represents the pinnacle of sports car racing in this country from both a competitive and technological standpoint as we prepare to elevate acura to tier one status among luxury road cars we feel it only appropriate to make this move to the uppermost level of american le mans series competition as well
9077142 this is the logical next step in our business plan
9077143 i am delighted with our teams relationship with acura and my longstanding involvement with honda
9077144 and we have taken another important step with this new announcement we are a young team but de ferran motorsports has a great depth of experience and talent within its ranks we are driven to produce a contending acura motorsports sports car program we look forward to the challenge competing in the lmp1 class and putting acura at the forefront of american le mans series racing
9077145 moving to the lmp1 class we expect to continue the progress that we began two years ago
9077146 our relationship with acura and hpd has been extremely beneficial to highcroft racing and we are proud to have been chosen as a part of acuras new lmp1 program in 2009
9077147 we have had a very collaborative effort with acura hpd and wirth research over the past two seasons we started with a good business plan and have been competitive throughout our american le mans series program adding patr n as our major sponsor strengthened our acura program and we have had a very successful 2008 campaign now moving to the lmp1 class we expect to continue the progress that we began two years ago the 2009 season will be exciting for acura and the patr n highcroft racing team
9077148 we have had an outstanding sports car program with acura the last two years
9077149 we started with the lola chassis and the move to the acura car was a great improvement for our lowes fernandez team now we will concentrate on racing for the lmp2 point championship as well as winning many races our luck hasnt been with us as much as we would like but our association with acura has been outstanding and we are pleased to be continuing our relationship we want to be right in the thick of the lmp2 title chase in 2009

9077169 they persuade countries to undertake huge projects like power generation road construction refineries and encourage african countries to borrow money from foreign institutions to finance these projects loans that several generations of africans will never be able to pay back this is all part of the new world order an order which suits only a few

9077221 the prime ministers legal actions are an attempt to use the courts to interfere with the official oppositions freedom of political expression and thereby give his party an advantage over his principal political opponents

9077252 dan tidak ada dosa atasmu terhadap apa yang kalian khilaf padanya tetapi yang ada dosa apa yang disengaja oleh hatimu

9077255 barangsiapa yang lupa dalam keadaan berpuasa kemudian dia makan atau minum maka sempurnakanlah shaum nya sesungguhnya allah lah yang telah memberi makan dan minum kepadanya
9077256 pada suatu hari di masa rasulullah shalallahu alaihi wasallam masih hidup kami berbuka di bulan ramadhan dalam keadaan langit mendung kemudian matahari muncul dan tidak dinukilkan bahwasannya nabi shalallahu alaihi wasallam memerintahkan para shahabat pada waktu itu untuk mengganti qadha shaum mereka

9077260 this happened quite soon after the original burial its not that a grave robber took it centuries later and hid it with the intention of coming back
9077261 the young workman who saw it was astounded and shouted land mine
9077262 archaeologists must explain why such a group was found outside the extensive royal cemetery
9077263 they must also work out why the bones of the unknown but by no means insignificant person were hidden in the citys most public and sacred area
9077264 we want to give our customers a taste experience thats beyond what they would find in a supermarket or a chain scoop shop
9077265 there are more people writing them today than there are reading them

9077268 the prediction from our geotechnical experts is that within the next four days we are likely to see a very significant slip event which could sweep across the road and on to the foreshore
9077269 we are witnessing the end of impunity and the restoration of the truth memory and justice
9077270 it was historic i brought them so they could witness history
9077271 were americans we can do anything when we put our minds to it

9077274 ive got to be honest with you i never thought a black man would get this far
9077275 but a lot of white people are hurting too right now theyre losing houses and jobs so theyre beginning to look past the colour thing
9077276 i just hope he doesnt get killed theyve done it before

9077278 if you believe you should pay more taxes im the wrong candidate for you senator obama is your man
9077279 if you think that the economy has done right by the american family then you should vote for john mccain
9077280 the rich people theyre the ones who invest in new companies that create new jobs we need to grow ourselves out of this current deep recession
9077281 if a thing is worth doing if a thing is profitable increasing the marginal tax rate on that is not going really going to change that dynamic
9077282 i will go through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less
9077283 weve got to set some priorities in washington and that means saying no sometimes saying no sometimes thats what we have to do
9077284 the united states believes differences should be addressed through thailands democratic institutions
9077285 to save lives protect property and public health and safety or to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe
9077286 accusing serbia of ethnic cleansing in kosovo similar to the genocide of jews in world war ii an impassioned president clinton sought tuesday to rally public support for his decision to send u
9077287 the administration said evidence of genocide by serbian forces was growing to include abhorrent and criminal action on a vast scale
9077288 on april 19 the state department said that up to 500 000 kosovar albanians were missing and feared dead
9077289 exclusive video interview gov don siegelman on stolen elections roves contempt and the magnanimous democrats
9077290 exclusive video interview gov don siegelman on stolen elections roves contempt and the magnanimous democrats
9077291 ti va di darmi una mano su questo progetto e una sfida
9077292 i championed reform to end the abuses of earmark spending by congress in fact i told congress i told congress thanks but no thanks on that bridge to nowhere if our state wanted a bridge i said wed build it ourselves
9077293 ketchikan desires a better way to reach the airport but the 398 million bridge is not the answer
9077294 despite the work of our congressional delegation we are about 329 million short of full funding for the bridge project and its clear that congress has little interest in spending any more money on a bridge between ketchikan and gravina island
9077295 much of the publics attitude toward alaska bridges is based on inaccurate portrayals of the projects here but we need to focus on what we can do rather than fight over what has happened
9077296 alaskas gov sarah palin like stevens a republican rushed over to rendell afterwards to remind him that she had vetoed construction of the bridge
9077297 alaskas gov sarah palin rushed over to rendell afterwards to remind him that she had vetoed construction of the bridge
9077298 part of my agenda is making sure that southeast is heard that your projects are important that we go to bat for southeast when were up against federal influences that arent in the best interest of southeast
9077299 she cited the widespread negative attention focused on the gravina island crossing project
9077300 we need to come to the defense of southeast alaska when proposals are on the table like the bridge and not allow the spinmeisters to turn this project or any other into something thats so negative
9077301 the kid whose mom will let him get a pet squirrel
9077302 but theres a baby one on the ground by the tree its really tiny and i think that its mom left it
9077303 its a word that people who dont like them use to describe them in kind of a bad unfriendly way
9077304 well each phyle has a different way and some ways are better suited to making money than others so some have a lot of territory and others dont
9077305 to make money you have to work hard to live your life in a certain way the atlantans all live that way its part of their culture the nipponese too so the nipponese and the atlantans have as much money as all the other phyles put together
9077306 because i dont want to live that way all the people in dovetail like to make beautiful things to us the things that the atlantans do dressing up in these kinds of clothes spending years and years in school are irrelevant those pursuits wouldnt help us make beautiful things you see id rather just wear my blue jeans and make paper
9077307 but you make money from your paper only because the atlantans make money from working hard
9077308 nell you should ask your book the meaning of the word discretion
9077309 i dont really want to get into daily progress reports of how it went but it was something that we decided to do last week
9077310 were going to just keep progressing this weekend and going through next week and hopefully we can just keep feeling better
9077311 it was good to get back there doing the same things the rest of the guys were doing having to do rehab having to miss practice its not really the situation that you want to be in
9077312 so it was good to get back out there get in uniform be around the guys and hopefully that can be the sort of the norm from here on out
9077313 certainly ive been preparing for the season opener for some time from a film standpoint its good to get back out there on the field and do more physical activity
9077314 i feel i got in some good practices this week i thought that was important
9077315 josh is a guy that weve liked for the last several years when he was in unrestricted free agency
9077316 hes got a good arm we thought he would be a good fit for us
9077317 yeah it would mean a lot for us to win on a big track like this
9077318 mile and a half and above tracks and downforce tracks have been kind of our weak spot
9077319 weve been making a lot of gains hopefully we made some gains that will help us this weekend and moving into the chase
9077320 it just started the confidence in our minds that were ready for the chase
9077321 the top five guys in the points have a very good point of view or mind set theyre going to be in the chase so youre looking at what you need to do to be as good as you can in the chase and building the confidence around yourself and the team that you can be a contender
9077322 we are pleased to now be able to move on we look forward to an exciting future of nba basketball in oklahoma city
9077323 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9077324 governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9077325 senator mccains choice for a running mate is beyond belief
9077326 by choosing sarah palin mccain has clearly made a decision to continue the bush legacy of destructive environmental policies
9077327 sarah palin whose husband works for bp formerly british petroleum has repeatedly put special interests first when it comes to the environment
9077328 in her scant two years as governor she has lobbied aggressively to open up the arctic national wildlife refuge to drilling pushed for more drilling off of alaskas coasts and put special interests above science ms palin has made it clear through her actions that she is unwilling to do even as much as the bush administration to address the impacts of global warming her most recent effort has been to sue the u s fish and wildlife service to remove the polar bear from the endangered species list putting big oil before sound science as unbelievable as this may sound this actually puts her to the right of the bush administration
9077329 of the hundreds of governors senators congressmen and business leaders available to you do you really think that a 44 year old person who has two years experience as governor of a thinly populated state is the best person in the country to be president of the united states after yourself
9077330 if you have no server or if youre worried about uploading to your sign in before you can post messages
9077331 our national spirit must exude joy and pleasure and say you have done well daughter of zimbabwe we are proud of you we wish you well shes our golden girl take care of her
9077332 russia has recognized the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia we support russia russia is right and is defending its interests
9077333 this is the first time that a robot has been used to remove a kidney through a single incision
9077334 we expect robotic instruments to be designed specifically for performing single incision surgeries
9077335 others have performed single incision surgery manually but by using the robot we have opened the door to performing much more complex procedures such as heart surgery
9077336 there are about 650 000 hysterectomies performed each year in the united states alone but only a small fraction of those are performed with robots
9077337 as a result hospitals are being overworked because of the longer recovery times required and patients are enduring more discomfort and more scarring than is necessary when using robotic surgery
9077338 personally witnessed ossetian militias looting and burning down ethnic georgian villages
9077339 the images strongly indicate that the majority of the destruction in five of the villages tamarasheni kekhvi kvemo achabeti zemo achabeti and kurta was caused by intentional burning
9077340 the high resolution images of these villages show no impact craters from incoming shelling or rocket fire or aerial bombardment

9077359 what an unbelievable head fake by mccain perfectly executed to build suspense and knock the one off the front page this morning
9077360 the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner its agent or the law

9077362 nobody knew about his announcement this morning except a travelling aide and the governors chief of staff who found out about this last night
9077363 the fundamental principle behind any selection of a running mate would be whether that person is fully prepared to take over and shares your values your principles your philosophy and your priorities
9077364 john mccain followed her career and admired her tenacity and her many accomplishments
9077365 she was scheduled for a high profile speaking role at our convention and included in the vp selection process because of his admiration for her strong reform credentials
9077366 she gave a slightly different answer and left the door slightly open as opposed to shutting down all the speculation up front
9077367 as my friend rosie odonnell says listen to mama vote for obama john mccain same same same
9077368 extends to every offence known to the law and may be exercised at any time after its commission either before legal proceedings are taken or during their pendency or after conviction and judgment
9077369 undoubtedly it may entail a whole chain of unpredictable consequences to other regions in the world
9077370 she was photographing a group of migrants when one of them offered to show her something else she followed him into a shack in the woods
9077371 suggests he was therefore not actually an illegal immigrant but someone else who was in the wood at that time as most of the illegal immigrants dont speak french
9077372 the atmosphere here among the migrants is one of sadness and shock
9077373 i dont really want to get into daily progress reports of how it went but it was something that we decided to do last week
9077374 were going to just keep progressing this weekend and going through next week and hopefully we can just keep feeling better
9077375 it was good to get back there doing the same things the rest of the guys were doing having to do rehab having to miss practice its not really the situation that you want to be in

9077403 people from the guardian and observer always want to know that its weird
9077404 why are you so obsessed with poshness somebody from the observer asked me why i dont have a cockney accent seeing as i went to a comprehensive school

9077406 youre an actor so act oi shes stealing my lines give me a script then
9077407 the way you can have extremely strong people who actually in private are completely breaking down everyone does it presents a front that is actually no one can ever know whats going on emotionally inside
9077408 am i very lonely and terribly trapped and all the rest of it no i dont particularly look for characters that are like some kind of biography of myself no

9077534 i thought the team brought a tremendous focus especially to the first two games i feel that the areas where we were inconsistent were due to either the usual opening game jitters or the fact that we did not make a decision on a starting lineup until later in the preseason than usual
9077535 this was a definitely a good way to start off the season and a positive step forward after last year
9077536 as a whole i thought our team played well but we still have some things to work out it was good to get out on the court and get a win under our belts though
9077537 nikki started this season right where she left off last year providing us with an effective and consistent offensive weapon i was especially pleased that we were able to have her attack from all areas of the net
9077538 overall our defense was more in sync than our offense
9077539 our middle blockers were all terrific at closing the block while our right and left side blockers set the blocks in the right areas all afternoon specifically i thought that mindy leah nikki farren and milan all did a great job of slowing balls down and defending the attack
9077540 i am very happy with this performance to open up the season

9077559 i did this as a reminder that the nonprofits rely so heavily on them it is a complete abrogation of our responsibility to not enact legislation to extend that sunset clause
9077560 what we will probably have to do if the legislature does not act in the next 58 hours is add an u

9077614 i started thinking as i was coming over here why is it that joe biden is the first in his family ever to go to a university why is it that my wife who is sitting out there in the audience is the first in her family to ever go to college is it because our fathers and mothers were not bright
9077615 those people who could sing and play and recite and write poetry those people who could make wonderful beautiful things with their hands those people who could dream dreams see visions why didnt they get it was it because they were weak those people who could work eight hours underground and then come up and play football weak

9077653 this coming 12 months will be the most difficult 12 months the labour party has had in a generation quite frankly
9077654 weve got to rediscover that zeal which won three elections and that is a huge problem for us at the moment
9077655 we really have to make our minds up are we ready to try and persuade this country to support us for another term because the next 12 months are critical its still there to play for
9077656 if we are to see real progress decisive political action which encompasses the whole of sudan is needed
9077657 continue to be hampered by significant logistical challenges and insecurity
9077658 will hinge on the will of the parties to resolve their differences through dialogue
9077659 all of a sudden it just dried up it was running good then it dried up and never came back
9077660 ive been spending the last month trying to prove its an emergency its hard on her health
9077661 i dont know theres so much b s going on i dont know whats happening
9077662 its very cool to have our team running so well to be on top of our game and its really fun to have somebody like kyle thats so fast
9077663 there have been a couple of races where its like either me or him and i think that brings out the best in a lot of people
9077664 for us its been a lot of fun like i said if it comes down to just him and i for the championship that would be fine but i have a feeling some of these other guys are gonna have something to say about that
9077665 besides that they have a little better race cars than us at sometimes then no not really
9077666 yeah theyve caught up to us the past few weeks but we finished second its hard to put that into trying to become any better
9077667 theres only one guy i guess that youre trying to beat the past two races but its that one guy thats going to haunt you the rest of the year all we can do is try to do our best and come up with some better packages to end the year out strong
9077668 i even joke around with guys with myself that carl is bff carl were best friends i dont believe its a rivalry i believe that we can still be friends and stuff like that and have that relationship on the racetrack
9077669 when ive won hes congratulated me and thats why all this stuff this week i kind of just got a chuckle out of it because i know deep down that what he says doesnt matter to me and what i say doesnt really matter to him what really matters is we race well on the racetrack so id say that well be fine
9077670 i dont think it means that if you get into another driver and spin him out then youre going to get suspended for a race
9077671 i think it has to do with the way that you got put on probation which is if you do the same thing that you did again then the repercussions for it are going to go up and that would probably be a suspension or something like that it means keep your post race antics down to a minimum
9077672 i just have to be a little extra careful not to let my emotions get the best of me
9077673 i did what i felt was best at the time and thats fine
9077674 the only bad part about it is just tearing up race cars when you dont need to
9077675 i couldve very easily drove off into turn three and doored him right in the left side quarter panel or something and spun him out
9077676 i didnt do that i tried to race him clean i tried to get back by him and i got bogged down a little bit by denny hamlin who got along side of me and we raced for a little bit
9077677 i never laid a tire mark on hamlin and got back by him and was just too late to try to run down carl i wouldve certainly liked to have tried to not touch him im not out there to try to move anybody
9077678 now i fully intended to make a care package and load it as full as possible the problem is i simply dont have enough hours in the day to bake 5 or 6 things for the troops the caf go to work feed my family and do chores i can get one thing done but how pathetic of a care package would that be
9077679 so i am looking for some volunteers could you maybe bake one thing seal it up and ship it to him if we all do this on the same day maybe hell get them all about the same time imagine how happy all those homesick troops will be to have homemade goodies you can make anything you want cookies of all kinds bars even things like trail mix would work well if you would please let me know that you are up for the task by emailing me i would sooo appreciate it i would hope that we could all get our packages ready by tuesday amp wednesday then if you would be willing to take a picture of the baked good and email it to me what i will do is make a big post on my blog linking your site and your sweet contribution next wednesday i think i will call it operation baking gals give a little support and if it works out as well as i hope perhaps we could continue sending things to different troops especially to anyone who has a special family member serving our country
9077680 thanks for taking the time to hear me out i really do appreciate it and while we may not be cheerleaders i think this could be a really great morale boosting endeavor dont you
9077681 and while oprah still hasnt called my regional newspaper did
9077682 yeah it would mean a lot for us to win on a big track like this
9077683 mile and a half and above tracks and downforce tracks have been kind of our weak spot
9077684 weve been making a lot of gains hopefully we made some gains that will help us this weekend and moving into the chase
9077685 it just started the confidence in our minds that were ready for the chase
9077686 the top five guys in the points have a very good point of view or mind set theyre going to be in the chase so youre looking at what you need to do to be as good as you can in the chase and building the confidence around yourself and the team that you can be a contender

9077710 theyre actually jumping away from our swatter because they take the time to plan their escape
9077711 this illustrates how rapidly the flys brain can process sensory information into an appropriate motor response
9077712 we also found that when the fly makes planning movements prior to takeoff it takes into account its body position at the time it first sees the threat
9077713 when it first notices an approaching threat a flys body might be in any sort of posture depending on what it was doing at the time like grooming feeding walking or courting our experiments showed that the fly somehow knows whether it needs to make large or small postural changes to reach the correct preflight posture this means that the fly must integrate visual information from its eyes which tell it where the threat is approaching from with mechanosensory information from its legs which tells it how to move to reach the proper preflight pose
9077714 is transformed into an appropriate pattern of leg and body motion prior to take off
9077715 this is a rather sophisticated sensory to motor transformation and the search is on to find the place in the brain where this happens
9077716 theres actually many labs around the world trying to figure out how their little brains work so we can use that knowledge to figure out how our own brains work
9077717 visually mediated motor planning in the escape response of drosophila

9077721 at the end of the day you have to remind yourself its a damned video game
9077722 this is a race against time the international community needs to respond quickly before winter when conditions deteriorate
9077723 if the response is slow or insufficient people could be forced to sell assets or leave their homes and villages and there could be a further deterioration of stability
9077724 this is the benefit i hear most from cloud providers
9077725 also for space reasons im purposely not including the flip side to these benefits however if you read this blog regularly you should recognise some
9077726 let me spell out exactly what change would mean if i am president
9077727 for over two decades mr mccain has subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else
9077728 what it really means is that youre on your own out of work tough luck youre on your own no healthcare the market will fix it youre on your own
9077729 what has been lost these past eight years cant just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits
9077730 what has also been lost is our sense of common purpose
9077731 individual responsibility and mutual responsibility thats the essence of americas promise
9077732 the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 per cent of the time
9077733 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 per cent chance on change
9077734 you cant truly stand up for georgia when youve strained our oldest alliances
9077735 if he makes it to the white house hell have an enormous mess to clean up if it doesnt go as smoothly as wed like to see then critics will say i told you so
9077736 there is no quick fix no magic bullet its relentless scrutiny of attendance behaviour maintaining quality of teaching and learning its basic old fashioned things
9077737 academies were always intended to provide a good school to children in the most deprived postcodes i am most proud of the fact that weve achieved that
9077738 this is a marathon not a sprint we want steady incremental improvements that we can sustain
9077739 this data shows that the government should not expect schools to turn round in a year schools might go up and down but you need to look over a longer timeframe
9077740 whilst it is clear that many academies are achieving excellent results this data shows that in some schools the performance is less impressive
9077741 the strong upward trend in academy gcse results has continued this year 27 of the 36 academies with results this year and last report an increase in the proportion gaining five or more higher grade gcse passes including in english and maths across all these 36 academies the average reported result is an increase of 4 9 percentage points which is likely to be more than twice the national increase this is a similar academy bonus to that recorded in previous years every one of the academies recording a fall this year still has results higher than that of the underperforming school it replaced over 12 percentage points higher on average
9077742 there appears to be some sort of problem with one or more of the heart valves
9077743 that could be indicative of a number of things but we wont know any more until we do the echo
9077744 he had his wisdom teeth taken out a few months ago is that how this all happened
9077745 i know because i just paid the credit card bill
9077746 i stopped taking them before i ran out of pills
9077747 i understand that blood cultures are due back for bill later this afternoon
9077748 id like to take a look at those in the meantime id like to send bill back downstairs for a doppler ultrasound that will give us a color image and allow us to look specifically at the blood flow in and out of the heart
9077749 but when the oncologist finished examining you he said to me that boy doesnt have cancer he has heart trouble and then he asked me where your doctors were i told him i didnt know then he paged hirschberg and acosta and they showed up and the oncologist starting ripping into them
9077750 weve been reviewing bills echo and the results of the blood cultures that were taken yesterday
9077751 and we think he has something called endocarditis its a bacterial infection in the blood stream that attacks the heart valves
9077752 the first thing we do is move bill to the cardiac care unit where we can monitor his heart activity on a constant basis
9077753 and then we will put him on a course of i v antibiotics thats why dr
9077754 and it lodges itself on the valves of the heart particularly if there is any sort of imperfection in the valves our goal is to eradicate both the bacteria in the blood stream and the vegetation that is destroying his valves
9077755 there is a very good chance that they will need to be replaced but we dont want to do anything until all of the bacteria is eradicated
9077756 well continue to monitor the condition of the valves but once we have killed the infection its very likely that you will need to have open heart surgery
9077757 in the honest belief that he needed to protect his son
9077758 it is beyond question that by acting in the way he did mr khan killed mr brown unlawfully and whatever their differences mr brown lost his life that is a consequence for which mr khan must be punished
9077759 what became obvious as the evidence unfolded however is that from time to time despite denials both mr brown and his son ashley barker were involved in acts of racial aggression towards members of mr khans family
9077760 in arriving at our final conclusions on public interest immunity and the discretion to order disclosure it will be necessary to consider whether this is a legitimate requirement
9077761 todays judgment discloses the shocking fact that the foreign secretary failed to give any proper weight in secret submissions he made to the court to the abhorrence of torture when he purported to determine that it was in the public interest not to disclose the evidence of ill treatment to our client
9077762 the foreign secretary has balanced mr mohameds right to a fair trial with the strong us desire that this information not be disclosed
9077763 many pensioners already worrying about whether they can afford to heat their homes this winter will be outraged by news of yet more colossal price hikes
9077764 it is a huge worry that one in three pensioner households are likely to be living in fuel poverty by the end of 2008 and many are already feeling forced to cut back on essential food or fuel
9077765 all the major suppliers have increased prices for a second time this year this is a heavy blow and few households will emerge unscathed or unconcerned about the future affordability of their energy
9077766 these are difficult times and we understand the financial impact this announcement will have on our customers although were one of the last companies to announce increases were sorry we couldnt hold on any longer however we have worked very hard to protect people for as long as possible from these considerable increases in the wholesale market
9077767 extremely reluctantly especially as household budgets are being squeezed so much
9077768 we need to concentrate efforts to slash carbon emissions and become more energy efficient in order to prevent dangerous climate change but we also need to prepare for how our climate is expected to change in the future the strategy outlines in detail the range of weather conditions facing london which could both seriously threaten our quality of life particularly that of the most vulnerable people and endanger our pre eminence as one of the worlds leading cities
9077769 london is not unique all major cities such as new york and tokyo are at risk from climate change
9077770 it is essential that the capital prepares for the impacts of climate change which is already affecting londoners through increased flood risk heavier and more frequent downpours and extreme heat
9077771 the mayor must provide a comprehensive action plan for reducing emissions that includes ways to make it cheaper and easier for londoners to go green

9077781 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
9077782 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
9077783 and i think its going to be more profound and long lasting than people thought
9077784 in the space of 10 months weve gone from a position where people generally felt we were doing ok to where were certainly not doing ok weve got to rediscover that zeal which won three elections and that is a huge problem for us at the moment people are pissed off with us
9077785 yes i do think he can i do think he will
9077786 well its always difficult you know you can always say what could you have done better and all the rest of it but gordon in september up to party conference has got the opportunity to do that and he will do that its absolutely imperative
9077787 well thank god i didnt have to go there on millennium night
9077788 at times he seems almost too straightforward even high minded for the low cunning of political warfare
9077789 a little flat and not just because of its now required state of the union laundry list passages
9077790 the stupidity of it that somehow the idea that it is all over in northern ireland and there is no need for an envoy this of all things
9077791 its hard for me to fathom how anyone who knows anything about ireland would say this this is a signal that the u s government will detach if he obama wins the operative word is detachment
9077792 senator john mccain has selected alaska gov sarah palin to be his running mate according to us republican party sources
9077793 huge contrasts found between uk nations patients in the uks four nations have dramatically different experiences of the nhs
9077794 dr nick goodwin from the kings fund health think tank said the data should be interpreted with caution as it is collected differently in each area he also warned that the data did not take in to account existing health inequalities or the infrastructure in place before different policies were adopted by each government
9077795 mr robinson said he wanted an immediate executive meeting to deal with the issue before it becomes a matter for the courts
9077796 i dont think its involves any deep seated policy differences
9077797 im told of around 150 changes many involve references to northern ireland being changed to the north
9077798 basically once a document is passed by the executive then thats it it should be put out in that form
9077799 ultimately it could go to the courts but i think its more a case of symbolising the bad relations there are at the moment
9077800 i think people have become complacent and they have not understood what would happen if an economy starts to slow fast if firms start to close what we have now is a turning point in many ways certainly you might think of it as a paradigm shift we have a global financial crisis an oil shock coming and people with little experience of what is really going on

9077804 in january five north belfast protestant clergy wrote to the unionist oriented news letter complaining of the failure of the executive to tackle sectarianism they wrote we have poor inter community relationships effective apartheid in housing across our villages towns and cities community division exemplified in but not confined to the physical structures of peace walls slow pace of reconciliation sectarianism and fractured educational provision our real angst is that a suggested programme for government almost totally fails to acknowledge these profoundly difficult issues exist the response from the dup junior minister in ofmdfm mr donaldson was that power sharing was the shared interpretation which seemed to confuse politics as means with the ends it aimed to realise the draft programme for government had significantly replaced the language of a shared future with a better future inline with its prioritisation of the economy a much more convivial focus for members of the political class than the challenge of tackling the communal divisions in which they were so deeply implicated the revised pfg32 published by messrs paisley and mcguinness introduced the clumsy circumlocution of a shared and better future
9077805 is a matter the government has to consider in due course but we are not at that point in our discussions at all yet the point of discussion we are at at the moment is examining the outcome of the referendum and obviously there will be a lot meetings with eu colleagues between now and the end of the year where it will be discussed further with them so its not just a matter for our own personal consideration or national consideration it is a matter we have to discuss with colleagues as well

9077808 even in these times when all the talk is of putting history behind us the easiest way to tell the difference between the irish and the english is to utter the word
9077809 i was myself assaulted and received death threats the depth of hatred that still exists in ireland is matched only by unawareness in non catholic english circles of what cromwell did in ireland i am reminded of gk chestertons remark that the tragedy of the english conquest of ireland in the 17th century is that the irish can never forget it and the english can never remember it
9077810 it was in accordance with the laws of war but it went far beyond what any general had done in england

9077814 until the executive shows that it can deal with the matters already devolved
9077815 it is increasingly a manifestation of republican frustration at the failure of sinn f in to deliver what it promised to its own movement
9077816 nationalists and republicans will once again be disappointed by the attitude being displayed by the sdlp
9077817 any commitments that were given by the government to sinn f in are a matter for the government but the dup made the situation perfectly clear before we left st andrews that we had not agreed to any dates for the transfer of powers
9077818 i say again that until the executive shows that it can deal with the matters already devolved it should not be taking on more especially a portfolio as contentious as justice
9077819 i was outside the family home when the raid began and i was inside immediately afterwards speaking with the family who are close friends of mine the reality of the ruc psni was here for all to see in broad daylight and the residents of this estate remain justifiably suspicious of the force

9077822 i would like to address those who are now shooting at georgian policemen i want to say with full responsibility that several hours ago i reached a very difficult decision not to respond with fire this was no use however and the fighting escalated
9077823 georgian president sakashvilis biggest lie was his attempt to airbrush the fact that he created the crisis by launching an artillery barrage on the south ossetian capital which killed scores of civilians and 15 russian peacekeepers it was absurd to think russia would not retaliate so the next lie was to claim russias leaders had prepared a trap in fact they were taken by surprise as much as the ossetians nevertheless russia should pull back completely now it should also have restrained south ossetian militias from running amok against georgian villages

9077828 after a few minutes of talking about inching forward towards the peace process haas finally snapped
9077829 yet there were indications that no 10 had more room for manoeuvre than it realised in july 2005 the ira had finally agreed to decommission all its weapons at the last minute adams called no 10 to demand that some of the weapons not be destroyed so that the ira could arm itself against possible attacks from dissident members unless this was allowed he threatened decommissioning would not proceed the blair government conceded but wanted to check with dublin irish justice minister michael mcdowell refused to acquiesce in the backsliding despite enormous pressure powell told adams of the problem and adams gave way decommissioning took place as planned

9077886 now that we can actually see a virus being born it gives us the opportunity to answer previously unanswered questions not only in virology but in biology in general
9077887 the result is that you can see in exquisite detail only events at the cell surface you never even illuminate anything inside of the cell so you can focus on what you are interested in seeing the moment it is happening

9077892 ive got to say weve had a massive big month and sometimes you need a gentle reminder every now and again about what has transformed the club in the last 12 months in regards to young players coming in
9077893 i really do think unfortunately given our vulnerability now of where we are gong to sit on the ladder we were extremely tired after a very very solid emotional gut busting month
9077894 i think well rebound a lot of these players simply havent been in finals football and i have no doubt some of them were subconsciously thinking the last thing i want to do is be injured

9077906 until today gmg delaware has been content to await gmg new yorks funding of the deal and has not exercised its rights directly at this time however gmg delaware is not confident in gmg new yorks ability to finance the transaction gmg new york has denied gmg delaware any access to information concerning their alleged financing and the trustee has moved to terminate gmg new yorks rights to the acquisition
9077907 independent of gmg new york gmg delaware has obtained a solid funding commitment for the full purchase price and has shared its funding commitment with the trustee
9077908 we have every belief that gmg delaware can and will fund the acquisition if provided the opportunity by the trustee and with consent of the court and we feel that our original bid was misidentified in good faith we hope gmg new york raises the funds necessary to close the deal however in lieu of the trustees present position and without information from gmg new york gmg delaware has our own funds to close and are offering to purchase the assets for the same price if gmg new yorks rights are deemed terminated
9077909 gmg delaware is confident that it can complete the purchase and that its bid represents the best return to the creditors of the bankruptcy estate for the trustee

9077944 oh well excuse me colonel pluck it just so happens in case you missed it in your utterly unobservant way that this day happened to have sucked beyond the telling youre not the one taken captive by aliens who wanted you to repair rebuild or engineer every failing piece of archaic technology within a twenty mile radius and when you refused decided that stripping you naked and staking you out in the sun on an ant hill until you changed your mind was the best means of persuasion
9077945 what colonel desert me leave me to the whim and mercies of an egregiously uncivilized group of natives who cant even manage proper waste disposal is that what you didnt mean to do
9077946 yes yes i forgot while you and ronon were off exploring the woods for god knows what teyla and i were left to our own devices in separate sections of what could only in the most rudimentary definition be called a town i was alone colonel for two days
9077947 this is true john i was thoroughly engrossed in my negotiations with idith i did not manage to see dr mckay for the entire two days

9077960 what happened is this an allergic reaction was it something he ate or something else what have you done so far
9077961 he was bitten several hundred times by a species of insect on the planet also he was exposed to the sun unprotected for several hours we did not think this to be a threat for he seemed well when we retrieved him and had no symptoms for several hours this reaction however had a very sudden onset ive seen dr mckay have a reaction to food and while that is frightening in its speed it is nothing compared to this we almost did not get the medicine to him in time
9077962 yes he seemed to respond to the first dose of the pen he was able to breathe for a short amount of time however the effect was not long lasting he could not swallow anything even while the medicine worked and he stopped breathing again a short time later
9077963 colonel sheppard were gonna take care of him i promise hes gonna be okay just looks like a routine reaction to an overabundance of toxins not a mckay allergic reaction but one that anyone could have seeing his skin id be even more surprised if this hadnt happened
9077964 im going to take care of him let me do my thing and ill be out in a bit with more news
9077965 not to worry colonel youll be arguing again in no time
9077966 ill let you know more as soon as i do

9077968 do not concern yourself at this moment john fulfill your duty de brief
9077969 with colonel carter then we shall discuss fault if there is indeed any to be handed out
9077970 had you done such a thing before left rodney with a group of people trusting him to handle himself well and not get into trouble
9077971 and had he ever removed his radio and entrusted the people with reporting to you before this
9077972 then i dont see a problem colonel it could have happened to any team and probably would have happened if you hadnt left rodney to his own devices
9077973 no maam it would not have happened had i been there because i wouldnt have let it happen id have had him out of there before those people could blink
9077974 john if youd been there in town you wouldnt have been doing your job and worse things could have happened trust me on this

9078155 it culminated in a document that set out the framework key strategies and actions for councils 25 year vision and essentially its master plan
9078156 pretty futuristic but she was committed to planning for 2100
9078157 some of the current councillors thought in 2004 that what i proposed was almost comical with the projection of time she said

9078225 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
9078226 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
9078227 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
9078228 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
9078229 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
9078230 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
9078231 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
9078232 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9078233 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
9078234 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
9078235 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
9078236 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
9078237 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
9078238 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
9078239 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
9078240 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
9078241 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
9078242 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
9078243 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
9078244 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
9078245 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
9078246 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
9078247 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
9078248 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
9078249 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
9078250 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
9078251 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
9078252 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

9078281 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
9078282 it is the intent of the legislative council that the investigation be professional unbiased independent objective and conducted at arms length from the political process
9078283 i think what it really gets down to is after the comma add potential abuses of power and improper actions is really what we are looking at or at least proposing to look at
9078284 no evidence of wrong doing some evidence of wrong doing clear evidence of wrong doing that will come back to us
9078285 at that point the body has to make the decision is this evidence strong enough to proceed on or not
9078286 i think it should be made very clear because there have been conversations about personnel matters that the issues really that we are dealing with here are not the termination of the public safety commissioner

9078291 i really believe there are things nobody would see if i didnt photograph them
9078292 if elected vice president governor sarah palin would be the first commercial fisherman to hold that office in the history of the united states
9078293 i cant say that since this convention started i havent thought about it because i have
9078294 i want to see how close to 60 votes we can get in the senate what the committee structure is and how best i can use my time
9078295 the job i do now i think is important and what i really want to do is make a difference
9078296 the question is how can i best do that is it using the seniority i have in the senate or is it in getting out there and running for governor
9078297 sen mccain has again proven that he has the experience and judgment this country needs in choosing alaska gov sarah palin as his vice presidential candidate gov palins conservative reform credentials are rock solid and makes clear what we can expect from a mccain administration i commend sen mccain for his choice
9078298 sarah palin is an outstanding choice for vice president as a western governor she understands the challenges that face western states such as federal land management last month during my trip to anwr arctic national wildlife refuge i had the privilege to meet her and discuss energy issues facing our nation she is very knowledgeable and her experience with energy development will prove critical in the months ahead as our nation still struggles with high gas prices gov palin shares our western values of smaller government lower taxes and the protection of the second amendment she will be a strong voice for western states as vice president
9078299 my choice by far was mitt romney i think a lot of good people were passed over with good experience such as tim pawlenty mike huckabee and tom ridge palin became a governor after i left office so i dont know her i only know what i see on tv i thought the other choices had a great deal of experience and thats going to be needed senator mccain is 72 years of age and somehow we have someone thats 44 with no experience in terms of foreign policy shes been a governor for about a year and eight months now shes been a mayor in a small town but the president has the right to pick the individual that he or she wants so he made the decision
9078300 i think its absolutely fantastic shes a westerner she does everything that the people in nevada do shes a hunter a fisher shes an outdoors person and most of all shes female were really excited palin isnt afraid to stand up when something is wrong and to fight corruption and it came as a great surprise we didnt expect it as a woman women are 54 percent of the voting population but now i think we have a real chance of breaking that glass ceiling shes a governor of a state and thats an awful lot more than obamas experience
9078301 i think that karl rove had it right at least for the next five days its absolutely brilliant
9078302 i think it was a very smart choice by sen mccain and the mccain campaign and i think she makes a great first impression on people and anyone who saw her speech today probably picked up on that but theres no question that a majority of voters in this election do not know gov palin at this point but they will the base of the party will be very happy with this decision reformers behind mccain will like her as they learn more about her record as governor of alaska i think gov palin made a direct appeal to sen clintons supporters in her intro speech today and her union background i think there are a lot of reagan democrats who will be very excited about this pick the reagan blue collar democrats
9078303 i think its a very interesting pick for obvious reasons having a woman on the republican ticket is an exciting and groundbreaking moment i believe also i think shes a bona fide conservative and i think those two elements not only shore any deficiencies that mccain may have but also add excitement to the ticket that was needed after the success of the democratic convention
9078304 hundreds if not thousands will fall through the cracks of an evacuation plan and they will be left in the city not out of choice but out of necessity
9078305 my thing is my fright is if we have somebody in these houses and theyre not able to get out theyre going to perish
9078306 if i was the governor of louisiana id give the evacuation order as soon as possible
9078307 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
9078308 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
9078309 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
9078310 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
9078311 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
9078312 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
9078313 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
9078314 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
9078315 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
9078316 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
9078317 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
9078318 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
9078319 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9078320 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9078321 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

9078382 her approval ratings are high 65 percent or so but down from 80 percent earlier in her term most alaskans havent watched her as closely as most reporters or legislators if you took a poll of reporters and legislators i expect her approval rating would be down in the teens or twenties

9078387 dont want to vote for someone they dont agree with they want to really be for somebody thats what makes the campaign work
9078388 the other things were going to teach the american people about sarah palin is that shes not just a conservative shes a proven reformer
9078389 bipartisan old boy network and immediately moved to clean it up
9078390 why not apply that same principle against washington d c
9078391 i hope she will help us solidify the base once and for all
9078392 also there are at least 20 percent of behavioral democrats that are available to john
9078393 im confident that governor palin will help us do that

9078399 selia shes working for the order theyve got her under some kind of spell like shes stuck in that dark form of hers
9078400 i have been a servant of the noble line of yantemar for untold centuries young defender is it not possible i have learned the tongues of men over the long years of my servitude
9078401 enough please what did thee say about my mistress what ill fate has befallen her
9078402 theyve got her under some sort of spell i think it has something to do with her curse
9078403 thou art wise beyond thine years melosa daughter of freya
9078404 thou art right to assume so my mistress has borne a heavy burden for most of her life a dark evil the likes of which thee cannot begin to imagine slumbers deep within her the wizard must have tapped into that accursed power and partially awoken her inner demon
9078405 nazmul was always a foolish mortal headstrong and power hungry are never good traits to combine
9078406 what art thou willing to do to free lady selia
9078407 good now defeating my mistress as she is now is nearly impossible any attempt to do so would be foolish and may do much more harm then good young defenders you must remind selia of who she really is you must make her light shine through the darkness that shrouds her heart and mind
9078408 listen young wizard of yan and i will teach thee
9078409 im trying to determine the most likely place the defenders will appear next
9078410 if im right they should be somewhere in the vicinity of arboth
9078411 theres been a huge energy spike in arboth nine chances out of ten its a pure stone
9078412 well dear it appears youve lost your touch over the years
9078413 nazmul knows of your treachery and your attack on arboth im his little spy after all but we can make this work ill help you get rid of nazmul permanently
9078414 i want the north to remain free of your control i care not for the south do what you will with it

9078420 the board has been set all the pieces are being set in motion all of them
9078421 so its true all the pieces are in play eh leizel
9078422 oh and since you seem to have unfinished business with him leizel do as you see fit
9078423 once theyve finished their stones will be completely drained theyll be helpless
9078424 trust someone and you end up with nothing now hand over the stones
9078425 you are the one nazmul desires as a host you must be destroyed
9078426 foolish girl they are not yours to give they are mine to take
9078427 i think so i mean her eyes went back to normal and she sounded like selia but she was still in that dark form
9078428 fear not young wizard this is what i had hoped for thou hast awaken my mistress and she is in control however she must be the one who frees herself completely
9078429 you have three of the four now you seek one more in the keep of nazmul it does abide hurry defenders youre almost out of time
9078430 whoa wait a minute youre going to go to nazmuls keep
9078431 did you notice brackus during the fight it looked almost like he was trying to protect selia not hurt her
9078432 you seem very pleased for someone who just got beaten by a woman
9078433 besides that little fact can you please get off me
9078434 so you have the nova stone what will you do now
9078435 wait for the opportunity to present itself of course and here i thought you were the clever one
9078436 well i can see youre in no need of my help ill be going now
9078437 you can relax im not going to kill you yet
9078438 im assuming you only gained this recent state of mind since your encounter with the defenders
9078439 just one question why havent you tried to strangle me yet
9078440 oh believe me im very tempted to but youre still of use to me yet
9078441 well for now we want the same thing nazmuls untimely yet oh so wonderful demise
9078442 oh really and why shouldnt i just toss you into my dungeons
9078443 now then i think nazmul would like to see you taken care of
9078444 now then i think nazmul would like to see you taken care of

9078457 the loss mitigation plan announced by fdic chairman bair to provide mortgage loans at affordable yields for troubled indymac federal bank borrowers is a giant step in the right direction to help distressed borrowers avoid foreclosure and stay in their homes at interest rates and terms that are affordable
9078458 the fdic loan modification program for indymac mortgage holders is a unique opportunity because it provides an interest rate below market for loan modifications and essentially protects the working class which is essential to maintaining the stability of our country

9078462 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
9078463 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

9078466 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
9078467 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
9078468 detroit offer the lowest entry level investor grade prices among major markets nationwide

9078472 governor of alaska sarah palin and the presumptive republican veep nominee
9078473 were extremely disappointed that the union is recommending that our employees reject what adds up to the best contract in the aerospace industry
9078474 we hope our employees recognize the value of this offer
9078475 we encourage them to study it calculate what it means to them and their families and vote in their best interests on sept 3 this is our best and final offer and thats what it means
9078476 boeing is rolling the dice on this theres no question about that
9078477 hundreds if not thousands will fall through the cracks of an evacuation plan and they will be left in the city not out of choice but out of necessity
9078478 my thing is my fright is if we have somebody in these houses and theyre not able to get out theyre going to perish
9078479 if i was the governor of louisiana id give the evacuation order as soon as possible
9078480 im getting out of here i cant take another hurricane
9078481 gov palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade
9078482 she shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade
9078483 gov palin and john mccain are a good match because they both want to overturn roe v wade
9078484 the last thing women need is a president and vice president who are prepared to turn back the clock on womens rights and repeal the protections of roe v wade
9078485 when as many as three supreme court justices could be appointed in the first term of the next president and john mccain promises to appoint more scalias and thomases and end a womans right to choose it is time for a change
9078486 in an era when over 80 percent of downs syndrome babies are aborted the palins feel they have been extremely blessed by god to raise an absolutely perfect son
9078487 gov palin continues to use her testimony to advance protections for unborn children
9078488 will i get a nominee who will keep his word to me in the vetting process if any word is actually given
9078489 we all know that dance nobody actually admits they ask the roe question and the question doesnt get asked and it doesnt get answered and therefore the nominees get on the bench and they do what they want
9078490 this is an issue that is enormously distorted in the public mind
9078491 thanks for all the hard work ra ra ra go riverhouse
9078492 its streets are somewhat decent and the housing stock is good
9078493 we are ridiculously excited to be hitting the states for the first time until now our bands closest experience to being in america was standing on the canadian side of niagara falls peeking across the water at buffalo ny so we literally cannot wait to start playing american shows its part of every british bands dream to tour in the us and the fact that we get to do it alongside such big and crushing names as suicide silence and emmure is simply awesome we just recently finished recording our new album hollow crown which were really really stoked on and were psyched to be shaking off the studio tan by playing some new tunes for american crowds at these shows alongside some tracks off ruin of course we love crowd interaction it really feeds our live show so if you know the words get down the front and well have a good fucking time see you there
9078494 canadians should prepare themselves for cases like the listeriosis incident as we continue to deregulate this is the result of a risk based system that puts business in front of health
9078495 processed food will never be a hundred percent safe to eat no mather how many inspectors you put on the production line
9078496 this will be a wake up call for both food manufacturers and inspectors
9078497 we are planning for our convention to open on monday
9078498 like all americans we are monitoring the situation closely in the gulf
9078499 you would have to dramatically change the nature of what you do much less partisan much less political
9078500 these storms have a tendency to change and so i dont have a scheduling update for you now
9078501 if its a major hurricane i think that they certainly need to show they learned lessons from three years ago both from a policy and perception standpoint
9078502 the republicans cant seem to catch a break when it comes to august and when it comes to the weather
9078503 public messaging and attention to the public affairs part of the response is going to get added attention
9078504 the american people want to know the people they elected are paying attention care about them and are making decisions they need to make
9078505 the smart thing is not to poke their chests out and say what a great job theyre doing or going to do but just to do what needs to be done
9078506 there was a mistake in a recipe for apple cake instead of calling for two pinches of nutmeg it said 20 nutmeg nuts were needed
9078507 when you get into these names that makes me a little squeamish
9078508 young men between 20 and 30 years old are primarily affected
9078509 you want to know exactly what youre dealing with so typically when we deal with plants we would provide the common name and the scientific name
9078510 a potato has buds its a stem its actually an underground stem
9078511 when we see that green color we can still use them we just have to cut off the green section
9078512 human rhubarb poisoning was a particular problem in world war i when the leaves were recommended as a food source in britain
9078513 almost anything if you eat it in large amounts could be dangerous
9078514 it doesnt mean you shouldnt garden you just need to do it with a bit of knowledge
9078515 if youre just buying food at a farmers market sometimes people are just really shy about it they see an unusual food there and they dont really know how to eat it
9078516 nielsen media research said more people watched obama speak than watched the olympics opening ceremony in beijing the final american idol or the academy awards this year
9078517 airline travel is airline travel its been bad for a long time
9078518 i suspect prices will go up fewer people will travel and if youre willing to pay the price it will be fine
9078519 despite this sluggish u s economy the general demand picture is better than it was post 9 11
9078520 in addition you have this consistent response across the board of airlines raising fares and adding fees
9078521 if somebody sees a good fare they should grab it
9078522 the reality is and i dont want to diminish this the industry is going to have to cover its costs
9078523 if there are fewer flights that wont bother me but if flights are really expensive i just wont go or ill go by myself instead of bringing my son and husband
9078524 and then youre good to go you dont have to worry about that
9078525 a very very small number of people would have purchased tickets for travel in september or thereafter before the flights were taken out of the fall schedule in may and june of this year
9078526 i think if oil prices continue to go down you will hear calls for relaxation of fuel surcharges but that doesnt mean they wont hike base airfares
9078527 i dont think most people in every aspect of their trip will notice a difference
9078528 if there is a silver lining it may be that as a result of fewer overall operations they may see better on time performance
9078529 people were saying they werent surprised which is not a good thing
9078530 i had one person say to me it seemed like a funeral on campus yesterday

9078538 i saw e mails from independent investigator stephen branchflower two days ago to the department of law saying its time to schedule a deposition of the governor her chief of staff and the attorney general who had some contact with the case
9078539 other issues with the public safety commission as to how he was doing his job
9078540 he tasered his 11 year old stepson he was observed drinking and getting into a squad car and he illegally shot a moose which doesnt sound like much but in alaska state troopers have wildlife authority
9078541 my fear was wooten could fly off the handle and do something that was irreversible
9078542 hes putting his children first and has nothing to say about the campaign or palin
9078543 and did she want us to do more than discipline him yeah anyone can tell you that
9078544 no one ever not her not her staff has ever said fire trooper wooten
9078545 they all said hes not the sort wed like to have represent alaska state troopers but the intention was clear
9078546 they were already done deals and he had already been punished
9078547 there was no new evidence and i called todd palin back and told him it was a closed case
9078548 he wasnt happy to hear that i got a subsequent phone call from the governor about it and she wasnt happy either
9078549 ive been a cop for a long time and i know how emotional divorces can get
9078550 if in fact it turns out to be the case that the investigation determines that palin abused her office by exerting pressure shes just being human
9078551 would lead a rational person to believe there is a problem inside the state troopers organization
9078552 i have objectively separated the divorce and wootens threats against me and my family with the fact that the troopers have a loose cannon on their hands
9078553 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
9078554 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
9078555 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
9078556 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
9078557 this looks like something that belongs in an adult magazine
9078558 i think its appalling to have something like this when kids are around
9078559 its totally irresponsible to have a photo like this in a paper thats widely distributed around our city
9078560 young children can see it its not what we should be showing our young people
9078561 the point of the cover is to celebrate summer the end of summer
9078562 its the last hurrah get all your ya yas out and just have fun
9078563 something like this is not to be sexual at all
9078564 thats part of the deterioration of our society to have things like this around
9078565 i can understand that its his realm as long as hes not dictating whats on the cover thats fine with me
9078566 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9078567 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9078568 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
9078569 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
9078570 doesnt count against your total number of actions alloted for the turn
9078571 we have shifted the culture of the emergency management system from a reactive to a proactive system
9078572 no government can take care of every need of every family or business all the time self preparation is the most critical thing people can be doing right now

9078592 the record clearly indicates a serious and concentrated pattern of unacceptable and at times illegal activity occurring over a lengthy period which establishes a course of conduct totally at odds with the ethics of our profession

9078595 sarah how a hockey mom turned alaskas political establishment upside down

9078609 john mccain was able to weave in his experience in a vietnam prison camp no matter what the question was
9078610 its much better than talking about how hes changed his total character between being a senator a kind of a maverick and his acquiescence in the last few months with every kind of lobbyist pressure that the right wing republicans have presented
9078611 i would hope that the democrats could have enough senators elected in november so that we would not any longer need to include joe lieberman among the senators
9078612 if the programs getting better and moving in the right direction then you as an ad take that into consideration
9078613 this is about a bunch of people that are involved in this thing this is about a bunch of assistant coaches a strength coach and a bunch of football players that have invested a lot expecting to see a return on their investment
9078614 we feel a sense of urgency to win this year
9078615 eh whatever i am a nihilist and care for nothing
9078616 conservative star with the talent energy and family support necessary to carry out common sense policies
9078617 a fine person her lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling
9078618 we knew through early testing he would face special challenges and we feel privileged that god would entrust us with this gift and allow us unspeakable joy as he entered our lives
9078619 we have faith that every baby is created for good purpose and has potential to make this world a better place we are truly blessed
9078620 todd and sarah are scratching their heads why is this guy representing the department hes a horrible recruiting tool you know so from their perspective everybodys protecting him
9078621 guard jealously your heart for it is the wellspring of all life
9078622 the major issues facing the country from terrorism and war to the economy and the direction of our culture
9078623 on the role of the presidency and the qualities that are demanded by the job
9078624 in particular it highlights mccains unique judgment perspective and experience to deal with the unexpected to stand firm on his convictions put the country above himself and make hard decisions necessary to protect the american people
9078625 this is not an opportunity to recap accomplishments of the past seven and a half years
9078626 it will not serve as a farewell to the american people and it certainly will not attack barack obama
9078627 this president knows better than almost any politician in america what its like to face criticism he watched his dad as vice presidential candidate for two terms go through that and then when his dad ran for president he saw it again and then in his own campaigns the two national
9078628 i wish i could find a way try not to cry
9078629 tomorrowwell be back at it but tonight senator job well done
9078630 i thought it was a nice touch to see the john mccain adcongratulating barack obama on the historic achievement
9078631 my father just literally died in my arms i notified all my kids and my lawyer notified dinas attorney lets see if she has the decency and respect to bring my kids to the wake and funeral this will show her true colors thus not even a call but thats par for the course with dina she didnt even send a card or visit when he was sick
9078632 while the mccain palin policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9078633 if you hear the dogs keep going if you see the torches in the woods keep going if theyre shouting after you keep going dont ever stop keep going if you want a taste of freedom keep going
9078634 threatens to become a hurricane and poses the biggest threat to new orleans since the killer 2005 storm
9078635 dont try to rely upon the fact that the levees are stronger than they were in katrina to assume that thats going to necessarily protect you from harm
9078636 loves all yall never know how itll play out darlin
9078637 b efore the speech you wrote in the wall street journal that you wereunimpressed with the staging the greek column look the hugeness of thearena
9078638 i know it will require the best i have to give and i will promise nothing less
9078639 i think she really completes the ticket for john mccain she brings a lot to the ticket that maybe the democrats missed the opportunity on
9078640 hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america but it turns out that the women arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9078641 i think itll hurt him with the state of the country right now and the financial problems weve got right now i think we need somebody with more of a strong financial background and i dont know that she has that as a matter of fact shes kind of new i dont even know a lot about her
9078642 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9078643 im not sure how much its gonna help im thinking that he could have gone with someone with a little more experience it might have been more helpful itll be interesting to see
9078644 michelle obama said shes been in love with barack ever since he took her on their first date and bought her ice cream isnt that sweet meanwhile john mccains wife cindy says shes been in love with mccain ever since he hit her over the head with a club and dragged her back to his cave
9078645 and now comes proof that mccain has learned to use a computer because evidently he has plagiarized from the internets
9078646 michelle obama must prove she loves america as opposed to republicans who everyone knows love america they just hate half the people living in it
9078647 mccain and obama are as you probably know ideologically speaking they are completely different nominees for example one offers you hope and the other offers you a dish of hard candy
9078648 the nights big event was obamas speech in front of 75 000 enthusiastic supporters and eight confused broncos season ticket holders
9078649 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
9078650 we look ahead to a better day as we also prepare ourselves for another threat
9078651 i think god is reminding us that on the eve of katrina god can bring nature back
9078652 i swam home and spent about a week stranded at my home
9078653 when we first received news that there was a storm out in the gulf that was threatening to be bad as katrina i immediately called and made hotel reservations in memphis
9078654 i had known for the past three years that i certainly was not waiting to make my plans
9078655 i think theres 8 000 rooms in shreveport total and theyre all full
9078656 i know they are going to be irate tired and were just going to have to drink a lot when we get off work
9078657 this thing can turn a different way and its all over with were not banking on it yet
9078658 what youll see is the product of three years of planning training and exercising it at all levels of government
9078659 all the models are suggesting that this thing is going to accelerate as its nearing the gulf of mexico right now gustav is not a large storm but that could change by the way
9078660 i think people are trying to be prepared i think people do have a personal plan and if they dont theyre definitely working on getting one
9078661 but i think the city is nervous people are anxious definitely
9078662 it feels like the city has a definite plan of action to evacuate the indigent and those with health problems
9078663 well you know i am not prepared to say what level of storm we can protect against
9078664 the general preparedness planning has been very very much upgraded
9078665 gov jindal has a handle on all the resources available hes also putting alerts out to citizens and very extensively telling people what they need to do what they need to be aware of
9078666 all of the prospective planning things seem to be in a far better shape than pre katrina
9078667 but im not so sure about the levees we could conceivably be on the verge of a real life testing of the stability of the levee repairs
9078668 you have to realize the levees were built in the late 30s and over the decades they evolved
9078669 the land sinks and the levee sinks with the land therefore they do not do as well a job as the engineers planned
9078670 if you would have asked me the day before katrina if i trusted those levees i would have told you absolutely theyre built by the u s army corps of engineers now even with the assurance that the levees are stronger than they were i myself have little faith in those levees
9078671 i honestly feel that if the city floods like it did before then thats pretty much it for new orleans

9078819 while their policies would take america in the wrong direction gov palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9078820 many colleges throughout the united states continue to experience incidents of anti semitism
9078821 on many campuses anti israeli or anti zionist propaganda has been disseminated that includes traditional anti semitic elements including age old jewish stereotypes and defamation this has included for example anti israel literature that perpetuates the medieval anti semitic blood libel of jews slaughtering children for ritual purpose as well as anti zionist propaganda that exploits ancient stereotypes of jews as greedy aggressive overly powerful or conspiratorial
9078822 racists and demagogues have ably exploited schools commitment to free speech cloaking their propaganda in the guise of academic freedom
9078823 they have two objectives hooking the countrys future leaders on the ideas they preach and generating mainstream media coverage through the controversy that inevitably erupts over particularly incendiary events
9078824 we have a psychosis in the jewish community that is unable to co exist equally and brotherly with other human beings you can take a jew out of the ghetto but you cannot take the ghetto out of the jew
9078825 mr ali and mr al asi are part of a speaking circuit that regularly makes appearances at california campuses beyond uci and has done so for many years
9078826 its troubling because they embrace anti semitic conspiracy theories glorify violence against civilians promote antipathy toward democratic institutions and introduce fabrications that go unchecked not because they have political views critical of american policies israel or zionism
9078827 the assertion of islamic values in public and political life
9078828 considering the sort of behavior and attitudes coming from jewish religious figures it is rather less surprising to see the actions of a secular jewish state this is precisely what qualifies yahud arabic for jews for displacement dispossession and depression that is why they have been stamped with shame mortification and the wrath of the almighty
9078829 the establishment of islam as a complete way of life in america
9078830 thats one indicator that somehow these people had some type of inside information that something like this is going to happen
9078831 or else they wouldnt be there with their video cameras taking pictures of this event in progress
9078832 they the jews who died dont come up to be the same proportion of the people who live in new york or the people who are of the jewish faith who work in these buildings
9078833 jews generally speaking they dont work as trash collectors and you know hard labor jobs many of their jobs have to do with white collar positions and especially when it comes to finances
9078834 theres 4 000 to 5 000 israeli jews who were supposed to be in those two buildings on sept 11
9078835 after the dust settles we ask how many of these 4 000 to 5 000 were killed in this tragedy and they can only confirm there was one death and three to four injured did they know something we didnt know and if they did we want answers why didnt they go to work where were those 5 000 and why are you covering up these facts
9078836 he named those people who were there celebrating that the buildings were coming down and how they were zionist jews and how they were arrested and how they were let go so the story was taken off
9078837 they do things to make people think its muslims when its actually them behind the scenes
9078838 were trying to foster dialogue and truth if we found out that something was incorrect we would change it promoting falsehood would be against my faith
9078839 their views are not reflective of what is heard in any classroom or any other venue on campus
9078840 you have a monopoly over money but youre not going to have a monopoly over ideas
9078841 i dont like to use the word but muslims and christians are outsiders
9078842 if we have officials in the united states government who owe their allegiance to israel before the united states wed like to know about it especially when they are occupying some of the most sensitive positions in the government
9078843 and ill just give you one example michael chertoff the head of homeland security a department that has about 185 000 employees this person is a dual citizen hes an israeli and an american and how many other dual citizens do we have in this country who owe their allegiance to israel first and the united states second
9078844 he is an american citizen and that is the only citizenship he has ever had
9078845 rupert murdoch zionist jew zionist jew owns fox news they say that its anti semitic if you say that the zionists control the media you better get out of here old rupert is a straight up zionist jew he is put that on fox news rupert murdoch is a zionist jew
9078846 theyre definitely jewish theyre zionist jews whats the other question the media yes zionists do control the media
9078847 war and peace militarism and pacifism violence and non violence
9078848 pacifica forum acts as if its striving to become a west coast stop on the white supremacist speaker circuit
9078849 they hide behind issues of free speech and claim its important to hear what these people say they lend legitimacy to speakers who have been discredited and widely condemned by almost everybody whos taken a look at their stuff
9078850 its not just the programming its the atmosphere where expressions of anti semitism and racism and homophobia are acceptable not only acceptable but warmly regarded
9078851 especially after we experienced beginning five years ago efforts to shut us down we became devoted to free speech
9078852 we felt that the speakers needed to be heard in this community in order for the community to be better informed about public affairs in general
9078853 if you rub a substantial number of jews the wrong way youre anti semitic
9078854 in that sense i have to admit that the forum and i in particular are anti semitic
9078855 until early 2005 the forum was mostly older people often more or less progressive but na ve in the sense that they were often unable to distinguish between anti israel and anti jewish positions expressions and programming
9078856 there are many good people and also many bad people in every nation but after many years of my experience and research i came to the conclusion that among the jews for some reason there is a much larger percentage of bad people than among others
9078857 they were quite well documented and in those lectures i didnt sense any clear anti semitism
9078858 we were spellbound by the amount of facts being offered us
9078859 anelauskas began attracting people for whom anti semitism was the message they wanted to hear
9078860 even if the authors name wasnt deborah bloom after reading your opinion piece in the emerald feb 7 there is no doubt that it was written by someone who is jewish
9078861 because only from people of that peculiar tribe can we expect such talmudic hatred for humanity there is even a famous saying that wars are the jews harvest
9078862 i hope that one day you will end up as the communist kgb did in the dustbin of history
9078863 jews view non jews in a distrustful and even adversarial way
9078864 throughout history jews have time and again wielded great power to further group interests that are separate from and often contrary to those of the non jewish populations among whom they live
9078865 networking they do for their own benefit at the exclusion of non jews non jews dont network with the same intensity and this was undoubtedly a contributing factor in what we now call the holocaust
9078866 the jews in the united states are now beginning to occupy the same positions or predominance in the lucrative wealthy professions and so on that they occupied prior to nazi germany which caused their tragedy
9078867 if hes made statements that are critical of jews its not because theyre jews its because of what theyve done or what theyve said
9078868 i admit that there were some bad things done to jews during world war ii but i dont believe that everything they claim is truthful
9078869 especially in these multiracial cities like l a or washington d c im losing my eye contact
9078870 im sort of afraid even of raising my head and looking at people right in their eyes because i know they may not be of my species
9078871 a small group of attendees with a white separatist preoccupation was attracted to the forum and started attending regularly
9078872 while never part of forum sessions e mailed views about race mixing blood consciousness miscegenation that tears down civilization and pollutes good races and the genocidal war against our own race began to proliferate
9078873 since pacifica forum is a public forum mariah and i had no objection to attendance by the self described white separatists and even entertained some hope of modifying their views
9078874 however we could not allow them any control of programming in a forum with which our names were regularly associated orval declined to exclude their influence in programming decisions and we thereupon formally dissociated ourselves
9078875 the university is committed to free speech and pacifica forums use of the space does not reflect a university position on topics that they present
9078876 the way jews in this town have treated the forum i must confess that im being impelled quite against my wishes to see in the jewish community a lot of unsavory behavior
9078877 so ive undergone a transformation somewhat in the direction of becoming an anti semite
9078878 gov mitch daniels has a one at a time approach what we need is a stronger economic climate overall
9078879 if people graduate with the proper skills it improves work force training
9078880 why anyone would want to do that i dont know
9078881 having an out of state contract is not doing us any good
9078882 most people spend their whole lives trying to figure out who they are but for me its about keeping it a secret
9078883 it was a liberal speech more unabashedly unashamedly liberal than any democratic nominee acceptance speech since the great era of american liberalism but it made the case for that liberalism in the context of the decline of the american dream and the rise of cynicism and the collapse of cultural unity his ability to portray that liberalism as a patriotic unifying ennobling tradition makes him the most democratic figure since john f kennedy
9078884 students with a strong jewish identity should consider enrolling elsewhere unless and until tangible changes are made
9078885 t he chancellor has failed to exercise his moral authority as an educator and leader by abrogating his leadership responsibilities the boundaries of rational and reasonable discourse by constituencies that have differing positions on emotional issues have not been established
9078886 we looked at the task force as a way to bring the community together
9078887 the situation for jewish students is untenable because of the hatred
9078888 in a volume not seen 15 or 20 years ago
9078889 whether this is a temporary aberration or an indication of halting progress can only be revealed with further study and action
9078890 for years we had been involved in promoting muslim jewish dialogue on campus but it wasnt enough to just talk about issues together we wanted to develop curricula that would seriously address and educate students about cultural religious and political issues that were the basis for conflict on campus
9078891 i went to the academic affairs office of the department of homeland security and said i know you are protecting bridges but were building bridges we needed to go deeper and have a greater impact on campus culture we wanted to take students off site so that they could develop personal connections and relationships that would build trust
9078892 while we are now assessing the data our impression is that these dialogue projects are contributing to a distinct lowering in the level of campus conflict over political cultural and religious issues
9078893 when you dont know people from other cultures its easy to vilify them when you develop personal relationships and connections you feel obligated to act in a more civil manner on campus and consider how programs speakers and articles in the newspaper will affect other students
9078894 its not that everyone agrees far from it but when the president of hillel and the president of the arab student association ended up living in the same building they were much more likely to talk through differences and do joint programming to discuss difficult issues than to fight propaganda battles in the campus media
9078895 when students feel that fellow students from other religious communities are willing to listen to them even when they disagree this lessens the level of tension on campus
9078896 the vicissitudes of tolerance jewish faculty and students at clark university
9078897 in 1925 harvard universitys appointment office sent a typed memo to clark with a list of five available candidates with masters degrees in mathematics the chairperson of harvards mathematics department initialed the document which he labeled confidential and wrote comments at the bottom of the page about two of the candidates about one masters student he wrote jewish not very clean cut personally and about the other lame not very clean cut personally as i remember him only these two candidates had x marks written over their names it is unclear whether the chair from harvard or someone from clark made these marks
9078898 when atwood tried to convince the board of trustees to approve a two year appointment for a refugee scholar in 1941 he pointed out that the applicant is a belgian not jewish
9078899 one year earlier a department chairperson believed that atwood opposed his first choice for a one year position because the candidate had the misfortune to be an armenian and to look like a jew which he is not the department head thought it might help his candidates chances if the president knew that this armenian scholar had a white anglo saxon wife who was an attractive intelligent girl in the end atwood agreed to this temporary appointment
9078900 discriminatory practices against jewish faculty and students reflected a xenophobia that plagued the united states during the post wwi era
9078901 henry fords publication of the anti semitic protocols of the elders of zion a tract accusing jews of waging an international conspiracy for world domination contributed to a political climate that influenced congress to pass its 1924 legislation curtailing immigration of racially inferior people including east european jews
9078902 many east coast college presidents implemented exclusionary measures out of fear that increasing numbers of jewish students would overwhelm their schools and threaten an institutions reputation pres a lawrence lowell of harvard advocated a quota system when the proportion of jewish students at his school tripled from 7 percent in 1900 to 21 5 percent in 1922
9078903 similarly yales pres james rowland angell supported his deans recommendation to limit the number of jewish students when they grew from 2 percent in 1901 1902 to more than 13 percent of the class of 1925
9078904 once one school introduced quotas a chain reaction emerged since none wanted to become a dumping ground for unwanted jews
9078905 as a result of these strategies the proportion of jewish students in yales class of 1934 decreased to 8 2 percent while the proportion in harvards class of 1930 fell to approximately 10 16 percent meanwhile princeton cut its number of successful jewish candidates by almost half ensuring that the jewish proportion of the student body would not exceed 3 percent the percentage of jews in the national population
9078906 a strengthening of democratic values the dismantling of the jim crow system of legal segregation and an overall decline in anti semitic sentiment led to the decline of jewish student quotas and to a dramatic increase in the number of jewish faculty
9078907 by the time of the passage of the civil rights act of 1964 legislation that guaranteed that all persons shall be entitled to the goods services facilities privileges advantages and accommodations of any place of public accommodation without discrimination or segregation on the ground of race color religion or national origin anti semitic quotas had all but disappeared in the academic world
9078908 knock a jew in the oven three throws for one dollar
9078909 the situation is better now on campus than it used to be
9078910 during the first and second intifada the level of anti israel activity such as movements for the university to divest from israel was more pronounced we countered at that time with a major campaign invest in israel to educate the campus
9078911 recently with programs like iact inspired active committed transformed in conjunction with bostons combined jewish philanthropies we have doubled the number of students we have sent to israel last year alone we sent more than 200 students to israel from tufts and then did serious follow up work with these students after they returned
9078912 one of the greatest strengths of israel is that it is a vibrant democracy the only vibrant democracy in the middle east as long as students support the right of israel to exist we have no problem with students who are critical of specific aspects of israel policy
9078913 the real challenge is to educate students to be passionate knowledgeable advocates and supporters of israel even if they dont accept every aspect of current policy we do this through travel to israel first rate lectures and introductory programs like israel 101 which is a peer led student program on our campus
9078914 was that students dont know their rights so we began a nationwide public education campaign
9078915 a surprising aspect of campuses as revealed in our work is the variety of manifestations of anti semitism such as intimidation from professors or the cultivation of a hostile environment from outside speakers or intimidation from other students it is different at each institution
9078916 anytime there is an episode of anti semitism san francisco state university president robert corrigan calls together jewish faculty community representatives student representatives from hillel and the anti defamation league and others to coordinate a response
9078917 forceful energetic administration led by presidents like corrigan who are very forthright and firm in their indications
9078918 with an administration willing to speak publicly and honestly about the issues there is no sweeping anything under the rug
9078919 to inform motivate and encourage faculty to use their academic skills and disciplines on campus in classrooms and in academic publications to develop effective responses to the ideological distortions including anti semitic and anti zionist slanders that poison debate and work against peace
9078920 if we talk to our colleagues in understandable language we reach them we need to be more than an israel advocacy group or a jewish group
9078921 arent always the outcome the complainant wants just because we organizationally disagree with a professor does not mean what he she said is actionable
9078922 the partnership called black jewish relations honoring our past shaping our future is based on the historical and systemic adversity both groups have faced
9078923 together we hope that we can serve as an example to other organizations campus wide by demonstrating that race sex creed and religion do not preclude organizations successfully working together
9078924 these are things that have to be funded we dont control the jail population and we dont control the health of the inmates
9078925 i dont see how if people in their own households are experiencing increased costs for gas food and other things how can they expect us to do more with less
9078926 we found out there wasnt a dime of overage available
9078927 we cannot go on spending and going into debt like theres no tomorrow without consequences
9078928 we have turned into a debtors nation both on a personal and government level and if this continues this city and this country are going to suffer economically in the future
9078929 these are some of the reasons why taxpayers need a break now
9078930 ive been on the council a little longer than you have and weve been playing catch up every year
9078931 i think it would be a big mistake to change our plans and push the problems further down the road
9078932 it all relates back to neohealth billing issues with medicaid and medicare that have been resolved by the state
9078933 you cant change the world without getting your hands dirty
9078934 i think those hillary clinton supporters have been looking for a candidate that they can really connect with and i believe that she will be that candidate and im very excited
9078935 shes a young governor shes already demonstrated leadership shes not part of the old guard shes not part of old washington shes certainly had some personal challenges i think she will appeal to working moms and soccer moms and career professionals all across the board
9078936 im very impressed with what i know about her a working mom with five kids and doing the job that she does her focus on renewable energy and how to bring about the energy needs for the state of alaska as well as the country
9078937 i think it will spark not only hillary supporters i think it will spark a lot of interest in the people who think that its important for women to have leadership positions in national politics
9078938 we think women will get involved more women will pay attention to this election i think it will bring forth conversations about family about finances
9078939 sarah palin you know she has a child with disabilities and here with the state budget were discussing cutbacks to exactly those kind of families people trying to raise children with downs with autism its very interesting how these national conversations have a very direct impact on california conversations also

9078964 ketchikan desires a better way to reach the airport but the 398 million bridge is not the answer despite the work of our congressional delegation we are about 329 million short of full funding for the bridge project and its clear that congress has little interest in spending any more money on a bridge between ketchikan and gravina island
9078965 i championed reform to end the abuses of earmark spending by congress in fact i told congress i told congress thanks but no thanks on that bridge to nowhere if our state wanted a bridge i said wed build it ourselves
9078966 ive been hearing it but i havent seen anything to substantiate it
9078967 i havent heard rumors like this since i was in high school

9078969 if interested were willing to talk to them about our property
9078970 theres been rumors circulating around these parts here in florida lately that six flags owns property in either pasco county or hernando county and have plans to build a park here in the future

9078981 our heartiest congratulations to capt anusha siriratne this is a significant event for the national carrier sri lanka has been in the forefront of womens empowerment and it is certainly high time that a sri lankan woman took command of an airliner
9078982 women have lagged behind in the field of aviation in sri lanka in comparison to the rest of the world even in neighboring countries such as india women have been airline captains for many years now
9078983 it doesnt make a difference whether you are a man or a woman when flying the circumstances dont change the weather is the same and the aircraft doesnt know the difference
9078984 every pilot at srilankan is elated at this achievement we now have several more female first officers in the fleet and hope to see them in command in a few years
9078985 srilankan has long been in the forefront of equal opportunity for women in this country and capt anushas appointment places the national carrier once more in the limelight
9078986 its been my dream to be a captain one day ive been very fortunate to have come up to this point and my husband and parents have been wonderfully supportive of my career all the instructors pilots and staff of the flight operations division have also been very helpful
9078987 millions of people come through lax every year but we need more training and support so we can provide the highest quality service and security that passengers deserve
9078988 this strike showed that we are willing to stand up for respect on the job and to improve service here at lax for workers and passengers
9078989 striking workers will return to work without retaliation and the parties will resume negotiations
9078990 i am urging the workers and contractors with the support of the airlines to come to a fair agreement that ensures quality services and keeps passengers moving safely and efficiently at the international gateway to southern california
9078991 we are pleased to strengthen our commitment to the pacific northwest by adding these new services
9078992 we look forward to giving our customers in oregon additional convenient service to wherever their travels may take them
9078993 air service is essential to the coasts economic viability and im very pleased that united express is going to provide that vital service at north bend
9078994 yes it has been a tough year for the travel industry due to many one time but significant events the snowstorm the sichuan earthquake the shortened may holiday olympic games without these one time but significant events the market would have been better
9078995 there might also be some other factors which impact the travel industry in the short term i e the difficulties that the small and medium enterprises face right now despite these short term challenges we are very optimistic about the long term prospect of the travel market in china one of the key drivers is the ever increased consumption power of chinese consumers
9078996 we are doing the right things and believe that our hard work will pay off as we develop our brand and the market rebounds
9078997 we have made several breakthroughs this year both call center and website we have really turned around our call center service as the two survey results showed
9078998 another key achievement was related to our website we upgraded our website by implementing quite a few new applications elong com is now the leading website for online booking in china we saw our online bookings grow faster than offline bookings since our upgrade
9078999 we went to germany we were greeted by hundreds of thousands of people who came to hear an american politician it wasnt because president kennedy had been martyred three years before even when eisenhower went to tehran he was met by thousands of muslims who carried american flags

9079007 child rights not profit must be at the centre of all adoptions in nepal

9079009 an industry has grown up around adoption in which profit rather than the best interests of the child takes centre stage
9079010 the vast majority of children in centres dont need to be there
9079011 they have family the first priority therefore should be to reunite 80 per cent of the children in institutions with their families not to re open intercountry adoption
9079012 senator mccains choice for a running mate is beyond belief by choosing sarah palin mccain has clearly made a decision to continue the bush legacy of destructive environmental policies
9079013 sarah palin whose husband works for bp formerly british petroleum has repeatedly put special interests first when it comes to the environment
9079014 this is senator mccains first significant choice in building his executive team and its a bad one it has to raise serious doubts in the minds of voters about john mccains commitment to conservation to addressing the impacts of global warming and to ensuring our country ends its dependency on oil

9079017 so the point that i was making at the time was that the political dynamic was the driving force between that sectarian violence and we could try to keep a lid on it but if these underlining dynamic continued to bubble up and explode the way they were then we would be in a difficult situation i am glad that in fact those political dynamic shifted at the same time that our troops did outstanding work
9079018 i know for my next project ill run for governor
9079019 the reader is asked to believe for instance that cassius a man who had just a few days in which to learn how to read and write is able to do both so well that he is able to comprehend all the nuances of shakespeares julius caesar when he steals his masters copy of the play and to forge the passes he needs to seemingly authorize his travel away from sweetsmoke on his own
9079020 in fact cassius begins to learn to read over a three week time period back in 1857 that was five years before the novel begins and in the ensuing five years cassius continues his reading education with emoline you can find that information on page 48 i took liberties with the timing of cassius coming into contact with the texts of the iliad as well as julius caesar all writers learn to telescope time from shakespeare and i wanted to give the reader an opportunity to experience cassiuss initial attempts to grapple with alexander popes translation of homer so i placed this within the context of the narrative realistically he would have been likely to read the iliad earlier with emolines assistance but i took the liberty as i wanted the reader to experience cassiuss first encounter with the god apollo five years seems to me to be more than enough time to take on a first reading of julius caesar as well as more than enough time to learn to forge passes

9079029 i set a goal and have done everything possible to reach the goal
9079030 had i stepped back last winter and looked at this logically i would have thought i just cant do this swimming was not coming to me at all
9079031 i didnt know the last 11 months would be as crazy as they were
9079032 it was a bigger time commitment on his end than i thought it would be
9079033 up until about two months ago i was really worried because it seemed like he was just learning how to swim
9079034 my first reaction is do it but there are things to keep in mind it takes a whole lot of your life its a major major commitment you cant go at it halfway it takes time away from your family on aug 16 17 i spent 10 or 11 hours training
9079035 its also expensive and you have to make sure your family friends and co workers understand what youre doing let them understand and they can support it
9079036 it was in his flesh that christ walked among us and it is his flesh that he has given us to eat for our salvation no one however eats of this flesh without having first adored it and not only do we not sin in thus adoring it but we would sin if we did not do so
9079037 rather let us recall that firmness of faith with which the church with one accord opposed berengarius who yielding to the difficulties of human reasoning was the first who dared deny the eucharistic change
9079038 i believe in my heart and openly profess that the bread and wine which are placed upon the altar are by the mystery of the sacred prayer and the words of the redeemer substantially changed into the true and life giving flesh and blood of jesus christ our lord and that after the consecration there is present the true body of christ which was born of the virgin and offered up for the salvation of the world hung on the cross and now sits at the right hand of the father and that there is present the true blood of christ which flowed from his side they are present not only by means of a sign and of the efficacy of the sacrament but also in the very reality and truth of their nature and substance
9079039 my lord and my god i believe and i adore and love you

9079041 as an industry we need to begin setting some basic common sense standards that reward pc gamers for purchasing our games
9079042 the console market effectively already has something like this in that its games have to go through the platform maker such as nintendo microsoft or sony but on the pc publishers can release games that are scarcely completed poorly supported and full of intrusive copy protection and then be stuck on it
9079043 if you look at demigod its still wildly state of the art in our trailer people asked if that was prerendered or from the game and its all in game but its scalable theres level of detail adjustment
9079044 we go from 10 million and 20 million people to 200 million people where were those 180 million people they were there all along waiting patiently so they could join the fun now we have no excuses we have to recognize that

9079056 tenemos cosas que mejorar todav a pero me siento tranquilo y contento con la puesta a punto del auto para este s bado
9079057 ma ana tendremos un buen auto para buscar estar entre el grupo de los punteros adem s de ir con todo en los dos rondas programadas de verdad estamos motivados y tenemos mucha confianza en lograr excelentes resultados en ambas carreras
9079058 creo que aunque no est esto y aunque consideremos que l no lanz el pelotazo de manera intencional tenemos que aceptarlo y seguir adelante
9079059 todo sirvi para algo desde los entrenamientos hasta las competencias sin embargo ahora es enfocarnos a lo que sigue que es el mundial juvenil que para m ser una revancha porque hay algunos juveniles que tambi n compitieron en china
9079060 el resultado fue bueno por la edad y la experiencia a lo mejor no fue lo que yo esperaba pero s que lo puedo hacer mejor imaginaba m nimo pasar a la semifinal pero a lo mejor no fue mi d a
9079061 s me gustar a llegar a igualarlos por ejemplo despu s de beijing siento un cambio en lo deportivo creo que es un escaloncito m s y hay que seguir mejorando
9079062 el equipo est m s motivado de seguir en la tabla de arriba para los rivales es desventaja pues se les complica sabemos que somos un rival dif cil de vencer hemos dejado de ser un equipo chico los n meros ah est n que son los que nos avalan
9079063 cuando un rival viene dolido es m s complicado nosotros hemos tenido un gran funcionamiento y eso es ventaja para llegar ma ana contra atlante nada m s se debe de seguir con el mismo funcionamiento con eso podemos conseguir el resultado
9079064 y ahora con mayor raz n es cuando m s se disfruta estar en lo alto de la tabla general debemos sacar lo mejor de ello de c mo est el grupo y reflejarlo en el terreno de juego
9079065 ahora s lo queda pensar positivo tratar de recuperarme lo antes posible este viernes se har n los estudios porque hay que esperar que baje la inflamaci n se espera de dos a tres semanas la recuperaci n
9079066 me gustar a estar en el partido ante toluca para ayuda a mi equipo pero tendr que motivarlos desde las gradas ahora s lo estoy pensando en recuperarme lo m s r pido posible
9079067 no hubo ning n indicio cuando realizaba putts de calentamiento de que la ronda iba a resultar as

9079069 la a1gp se alegra por estar de regreso en indonesia una vez m s la temporada cuatro marcar nuestra tercera visita al pa s el cual siempre atrae a una base de aficionados intensa y apasionada en apoyo del a1 team indonesia
9079070 me siento muy feliz nuevamente agradecido ilusionado por mi trabajo contento de seguir formando parte de este gran grupo de jugadores que est haciendo una gran labor en la eliminatoria rumbo al mundial
9079071 el que repita la convocatoria es parte de ese proceso que quiere realizar habr modificaciones m s adelante pero creo que van a ser muy pocas
9079072 claro que estoy contento cuando me avisaron que me iba a grandes ligas no lo pod a creer tengo confianza en dar mi mejor esfuerzo y demostrar mis cualidades sobre el mont culo
9079073 fue una gran noticia la cual todo pelotero quiere escuchar llegamos de una gira y me avisaron despu s del juego todos me felicitaron y me desearon la mejor de las suertes
9079074 en cuanto a la definici n hay que ser m s contundentes y tener m s confianza frente al arco pero m s all de eso creo que se est haciendo un buen trabajo y el equipo ha respondido bien
9079075 hay que estar m s atentos a la hora de definir y las ocasiones que tengamos hay que hacer los goles porque como se vio ante am rica dominamos el encuentro pero nos hicieron el primer gol por lo que hay que estar atentos
9079076 para el jugador creo que es antideportivo jugar a la doce del d a cuando el sol est en su punto de calor as que tendremos que acostumbrarnos a eso y adaptarnos a lo que se tenga que hacer en el terreno de juego
9079077 pienso que fue un buen esfuerzo de calificaci n no practicamos en condiciones secas y creo que fuimos uno de los m s r pidos en la lluvia
9079078 fue un d a complicado por el clima arrancamos en la segunda fila igual que en mosport y por poco ganamos esa carrera estamos en buen lugar y debe de ser una buena competencia para nosotros pienso que ser una carrera intensa todo el tiempo y la clave ser la estrategia de carera
9079079 ese es uno de los motivos que tenemos todos intentar ganar el partido contra monterrey y sacar los nueve puntos de la semana porque viene un periodo de receso en la que vamos a tratar de trabajar para mejorar muchas cosas porque despu s ya no vamos a tener tiempo
9079080 se ha creado un cl sico muy importante que nos llega a nosotros pero m s que nada debemos ganar por nosotros mismos y es una bonita prueba para seguir mejorando y creciendo ante un rival dif cil que juega bien el futbol
9079081 creo que ah estamos en un buen nivel obviamente a excepci n del partido contra am rica que no deb amos perder el equipo est bien porque sigue manejando los mismos conceptos estamos creciendo mucho en el aspecto f sico t cnico y t ctico conforme vayan pasando los juegos se va a ir consolidando como un equipo m s fuerte todav a
9079082 no me arrepiento y pienso si deb haber parado o no
9079083 amo participar en este juego y lo har como sea
9079084 el no va a estar de receptor todos los d as
9079085 pienso que la cosa m s importante este a o es asegurar que cuando termine la temporada l haya superado la lesi n que se sienta bien al respecto y que nosotros nos sintamos bien al respecto esa es nuestra meta
9079086 mejorando esos aspectos se ver un tecos mejor y hay que aprender sin dejar de mencionar que no basta jugar bien sesenta o setenta minutos tenemos que mantenernos bien durante los noventa minutos
9079087 no me preocupa el descenso porque estamos bien tenemos un equipo muy bien armado que puede librar el descenso y no s lo eso tambi n pelear en lo m s alto
9079088 tengo contrato con el real madrid pero estamos en negociaciones con el chelsea yo ya manifest cu l era mi voluntad y ahora estoy negociando
9079089 tengo la ilusi n de jugar la premier el chelsea tiene una gran plantilla un gran equipo y me ha hecho una buena oferta tanto para m como para el real madrid
9079090 cosas como que el club me ha mandado pedir perd n para volver a jugar s lo quer a aclarar esto y decir que las negociaciones contin an
9079091 sorprend con mi peso a todos y los dej pasmados
9079092 estoy listo para subirme al cuadril tero y continuar invicto y darle un triunfo m s a puerto rico
9079093 me doli mucho en un momento pero eso me ayud a ser un poco m s agresivo para no correr tanto
9079094 ante los medios de comunicaci n nos hacemos responsables de estos resultados porque nosotros somos los que inscribimos participamos y somos los que hacemos las evaluaciones
9079095 quisiera que alguien me diga c mo no bamos a decir que silvio fern ndez ten a oportunidad de conseguir una medalla siendo el primero del r nking mundial lo mismo nos pas con alfonso blanco subcampe n mundial de boxeo h ctor manzanilla jonathan su rez campe n mundial bmx y mayelis caripa tercera del mundo
9079096 como lo he venido diciendo desde mucho antes de los juegos ol mpicos los pron sticos se basan en los registros y marcas
9079097 desde ya empezaremos a hacer las reuniones con las federaciones para evaluar la actuaci n tambi n le presentaremos al presidente del pa s hugo ch vez cuatro proyectos espec ficos para el desarrollo deportivo del pa s
9079098 el haber alcanzado una medalla no es un retroceso y creo que la idea no es politizar el deporte porque los 110 deportistas lograron su clasificaci n gracias a sus propios m ritos y no por decisi n de un gobierno o del comit ol mpico ni por alguna federaci n
9079099 una vez que los directivos de la federaci n ecuatoriana de f tbol recibieron los documentos enviados por los directivos del wigan ingl s donde act a valencia que aclaraban su situaci n el seleccionador sixto vizuete ha procedido a convocarlo
9079100 una vez aclarada la situaci n el jugador ha sido convocado y llegar el lunes venidero a quito para entrenarse pensando en el encuentro ante uruguay en montevideo
9079101 har toda su recuperaci n en la toca da raposa ii porque aqu tenemos el mejor centro de recuperaci n del pa s junto con el del sao paulo
9079102 estoy seguro de que se va a recuperar r pido y ya tenemos un contrato por dos a os bien encaminado para que l sea jugador del cruzeiro cuando est plenamente repuesto
9079103 uma a hab a hablado de una rotaci n que al final no se est dando debido al buen momento que tiene berbia
9079104 es una decisi n de tipo familiar ya que tengo que velar por la estabilidad de un hogar y si no tengo continuidad es casi imposible que mis hijas est n bien
9079105 on andrassi first it reminded us of our stay in india but the food was really tasty fresh truly indian taste as well as cheap compared to the fancy restaurants on the other side of the street
9079106 theres a whole series of our vehicles full seized trucks and some cross overs that have a heated windshield washer system
9079107 the circuit board apparently can short and normally what happens is theres smoke and the system doesnt work but in rare cases there could be a fire
9079108 in rare instances a fire can occur so we want to make sure that our customers are safe
9079109 its a very simple and fast fix and it really isnt all that inconvenient to them especially this time of year
9079110 oh we took the snorkeling excursion and then walked around nassau and did some shopping how about you guys
9079111 we drank 437 pina coladas pissed on some fish in the ocean and then held tanishas hair back while she puked in a bag on the taxi ride back to the ship shes the one over there at the other table in the dress with the neckline down to her navel next to the big guy with the sleeveless t shirt and the racing stripe sunburn lines and the aluminum bottle of bud in his hand
9079112 itll be hard to top last season but it wont be hard to be me just work hard every day at practice every time i get a chance to and hopefully ill do better than last year
9079113 i want to win ive never won a championship so thats one thing i really want to do
9079114 if playing his four years are good enough for jerry rice its pretty much good enough for anybody
9079115 will it be next year will it be in a couple of years
9079116 i dont know that but hes going to have to make that decision at the end of the season
9079117 we have so many weapons we feel teams are going to have trouble defending us
9079118 i dont think anyones going to be able to just prepare for crab
9079119 if they focus on me then they will have a problem
9079120 well probably beat them by 70 if they do that they need to focus on tech
9079121 public safety was the overriding concern expressed by all parties when we met with the governor and his staff today
9079122 ten a m is obviously not the optimal time for a football game but when one of the options was to not play the game at all this is a matter of making the best of an unfortunate situation
9079123 at this point going against ourselves i would venture to say that were probably a better defense than we were at any time last year
9079124 our defense is going to be a lot better and our offense is going to be a lot better so im feeling pretty positive
9079125 were going to have them in the game as much as they can go because theyve gotten bigger and stronger
9079126 he was mad that mike left but he wasnt saying much anyway
9079127 i was like wow thats a side we havent seen out of him
9079128 i dont know if i saw a difference in them whereas they might have seen one in me
9079129 this is why you play football and if you cant get excited in game week then youre in the wrong business
9079130 i didnt give them a chance to show me what they had as much as i wanted to explain what this was all about and how excited they should be
9079131 you lay it on the line out there you hope your preparation beats their preparation you hope your coaching beats their coaching your players beat their players
9079132 i will say this asu is a very well coached team in all phases this is a good challenge for us
9079133 theyre not going to be intimidated coming into kyle field
9079134 today is a special day one for reflection thats tinged with both sadness and joy
9079135 john peel everyday is not responsible for the content of external bbc websites
9079136 if we as a society lose our voice completely and corporations start doing all the talking then well be utterly lost to some degree this has already happened our ability to envision a future collectively has already been severely compromised
9079137 im going for walk i may be gone some time
9079138 heute erleben wir ein st ck dessen was aus diesem traum geworden ist
9079139 ich habe vorhin gedacht wie stolz mein vater w re stolz auf barack obama stolz auf die partei die ihn nominiert und stolz auf amerika das ihn w hlen wird
9079140 es stimmt die steuer beh rde war bei uns schalke hat aber kein geld hinterzogen
9079141 es gibt ein ermittlungsverfahren bei schalke 04 wegen eines steuervergehens sowohl die gesch ftsstelle von schalke als auch mehrere private objekte wurden durchsucht dabei geht es um einen spielertransfer der l ngere zeit zur ckliegt

9079152 buy target go with bill ackman i like this trade
9079153 i am a lifetime member of the nra i support our constitutional right to bear arms and am a proponent of gun safety programs for alaskas youth
9079154 the standard should be no different for industry ironically were trying to convince the rest of the nation to open anwr but we cant even get our own pt thomson which is right on the edge of anwr developed we are ready for that gas to be tapped so we can fill a natural gas pipeline i promise to vigorously defend alaskas rights as resource owners to develop and receive appropriate value for our resources
9079155 im keenly aware of sharply declining production from north slope fields the amount of oil currently flowing through the pipeline is less than half of what it was at its peak we must look to responsible development throughout the state from the slope all the way down to southeast every region participating from further oil and gas development to fishing mining timber and tourism these developments remain the core of our state we provide stability in regulations for our developers
9079156 i support adequate funding for a strong public safety presence in alaska feeling safe in our communities is something we cannot accept any compromise on this includes policing in all its forms the court system prosecutors and corrections if the legislature passed a death penalty law i would sign it we have a right to know that someone who rapes and murders a child or kills an innocent person in a drive by shooting will never be able to do that again
9079157 i am pro life and i believe that marriage should only be between and man and a woman i am opposed to any expansion of gambling in alaska
9079158 many people will express sympathy but you dont want or need that because trig will be a joy children are the most precious and promising ingredient in this mixed up world trig is no different except he has one extra chromosome
9079159 trig is beautiful and already adored by us we knew through early testing he would face special challenges and we feel privileged that god would entrust us with this gift and allow us unspeakable joy as he entered our lives we have faith that every baby is created for good purpose and has potential to make this world a better place we are truly blessed

9079167 we are extremely disappointed that carol albert has decided to give up on the future of coney island when her current lease isnt even up for a number of months said sitt spokesman stefan friedman
9079168 it would be an absolute shame if astrolands lease is not renewed for another season but even if it is this year to year existence will not lead to the revitalization coney island needs
9079169 the bloomberg administrations rezoning plan will create an enhanced amusement district more than twice the size of the one we see today new housing elsewhere in the area and thousands of new jobs thats the kind of long term solution coney needs
9079170 lo importante es que se trata de gente de pergamino la que nos fue a proponer este emprendimiento y no se trata de inversores de buenos aires que apuesten por el interior ya que all se enfocan en negocios que tal vez sean considerados m s seguros como puerto madero o palermo nuevo la familia carballo nos hizo la propuesta porque cre a que esto era posible y nosotros en un principio fuimos sorprendidos despu s de analizarlo nos interes como un desaf o no sin antes hacer un estudio de mercado que naturalmente nos dio positivo
9079171 no tiene nada que envidiarle a ning n otro edificio de buenos aires
9079172 personalmente dijo estoy comercializando varias torres en buenos aires y puedo asegurar que si a este edificio se lo pone en puerto madero por algunas cuestiones hasta podr a llegar a sobresalir va a dar que hablar y no es casualidad que est planificado para pergamino sacando buenos aires c rdoba capital rosario y mar del plata no hay ciudades que tengan una torre como esta por eso este emprendimiento va a marcar la sensaci n t rmica de lo que puede venirse para ciudades de las caracter sticas de pergamino
9079173 podr causar un efecto disparador para pergamino ya que hay otras firmas que analizaron una posibilidad como la nuestra pero decidieron continuar en grandes ciudades donde el negocio aparece como m s seguro por eso del xito de esta torre podr n surgir emprendimientos similares en la ciudad
9079174 despu s de la propuesta interesante de la familia carballo fueron casi dos a os de charlas y reuniones y para m hubo un primer quiebre positivo cuando fui notando el entusiasmo y el convencimiento de ellos para que pudi ramos encarar esta empresa ellos me vendieron muy bien pergamino una ciudad que yo no conoc a y el otro quiebre fue cuando vine por unos d as y constat personalmente de qu se trataba hicimos un estudio de mercado tuvimos en cuenta que la ciudad est enclavada en un corredor productivo muy importante cerca de rosario y de buenos aires la pronta llegada de la autopista es otro dato relevante y las referencias de mercado nos dieron muy bien en cuanto al pbi per c pita la cantidad de sucursales bancarias es la segunda del pa s en proporci n a la cantidad de habitantes nos dimos cuenta que las condiciones estaban dadas para apostar en pergamino
9079175 si esto no funciona me costar a explicar la raz n
9079176 est en condiciones de tener m s de una torre de este nivel
9079177 tenemos mucha confianza en esta idea y por eso a pesar de que estoy comercializando otros emprendimientos decid venir personalmente a encabezar el equipo a pergamino pero al mismo tiempo no quisimos traer m s gente de buenos aires sino que priorizamos a los vendedores locales adem s esto va a generar mano de obra venta de materiales transporte etc tera son 15 mil metros de construcci n durante m s de dos a os y eso le inyectar un movimiento importante a la vida de la ciudad
9079178 no se empieza a construir si no est conformado el ciento por ciento del fideicomiso
9079179 en definitiva dijo ramos otero aqu no hay medias tintas o se construye o no se empieza sin existir la posibilidad de que el emprendimiento quede a mitad de camino
9079180 venimos muy bien con las ventas a otro ritmo que el de buenos aires pero por cuestiones l gicas vemos m s cautela pero nosotros nos tenemos que amoldar al modo de pensar y de actuar que tiene la gente de esta ciudad son 71 unidades con un monto total de inversi n de aproximadamente 15 millones de d lares y en los primeros d as ya concretamos muchas reservas

9079215 we recommend installing storm shutters to protect your windows or nailing plywood panels to your window frames when a storm approaches
9079216 it is also a good idea to cover your sliding doors with plywood and to replace old garage doors and tracks with a door that is approved for both wind pressure and impact protection

9079252 do not expect the speech to define the presidents legacy this is not an opportunity to recap accomplishments of the past seven and a half years it will not serve as a farewell to the american people and it certainly will not attack barack obama
9079253 some seem to believe we should negotiate with terrorists and radicals as if some ingenious argument will persuade them they have been wrong all along
9079254 we have heard this foolish delusion before as nazi tanks crossed into poland in 1939 an american senator declared lord if only i could have talked to hitler all of this might have been avoided we have an obligation to call this what it is the false comfort of appeasement which has been repeatedly discredited by history
9079255 it speaks volumes for this country that its an opportunity its the land of opportunity for all people
9079256 liberals are weak on defense i brought down the commies
9079257 o conceito de depend ncia sexual pol mico e por isso dif cil defini lo

9079262 googles a great company got some great products but you know in some respects i think google is where microsoft was 7 or 10 years ago
9079263 microsoft has over 40 full time people invested in privacy and over 400 part time people google hasnt at least from what i read about them evolved to that
9079264 we think about privacy as part of the core design we have thought about how to design privacy into the product as opposed to how to react to the negative impressions
9079265 so these are all images that anyone could go out and take with a camera we do take great care that if someone did feel their privacy was invaded there is a way that they can easily tell us about it and well remove it right away
9079266 the thing is any time you get a provider in the market that has a predominantly large share of that market questions start to get asked about their practices about what their motives are
9079267 i desperately hope that they in fact i expect that they will change they will become as grown up as some of the larger companies around so in some respects its a predictable thing

9079303 i didnt see any agro at all everyone was there for the same reason everyone was stoked to be there its a moment in history that we should be proud of its a step forward for the civil rights movement the fact that it was 45 years to the date from when martin luther king jr gave his i have a dream speech i thought it was a really beautiful event i think that was the sentiment for most people
9079304 people were hooting and hollering waving their flags i gotta tell ya for the first time in my life i was waving an american flag and feeling proud to be an american for me that was really a unique experience today im wearing my 9 11 new york police department gaelic football club jersey im pumped up

9079307 i want to play some new material off the new album and maybe some songs off the older albums that we havent played in a long time

9079312 in the past some patients would come and be operated on and then spend days in the hospital now with new technology they can be operated on and go home the same day
9079313 once i turned the corner i was able to use my speed to outrun everyone down the sideline

9079325 absolutely yup yup especially with a good team around us
9079326 certainly in this election cycle women are not finished yet and women can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9079327 i think that sarah appeals to a lot of voters i think because of her independence because of her reform agenda and her record of balancing both family and service is motivation to not just clinton voters but to lots of voters
9079328 what ive had to do though is in the middle of the night put down the blackberries and pick up the breast pump do a couple of things different and still get it all done
9079329 any woman whos been in a situation where theyre working and have children know that you give 300 percent no one will be slighted in any of this least of all her baby she has a lot of energy shes a woman with great drive and great vision and i think no ones going to suffer in this process we will all get it done
9079330 run the country in case of big crisis with iran russia
9079331 sarah palins lack of experience on every front and on nearly every issue this vice presidential pick doesnt show judgment it shows political panic
9079332 omg mccains vp pick has sucked all of the oxygen out of the room for obama
9079333 this is the same mentality that we accused the blacks of
9079334 there will be lots of glass to help promote the aquatics center as a vibrant and active space
9079335 and this is obviously the opposite of the muslim womens requirements
9079336 to cover the pool windows with this type of automatic blind will be costly probably in the thousands of dollars

9079340 on the preparation and implementation of an alaska climate change strategy
9079341 governor palin not only stands with john mccain in his belief that global warming is a critical issue that must be addressed but she has been a leader in addressing climate change
9079342 you dont make peace with your friends but with your enemies
9079343 recently arrived in the operations room says tomer i saw an instruction manual security dellidf that should not have been there
9079344 there were also cds of our army with the inscription confidential which documented the activities of our armed organisation of our special units and the generality of the officers
9079345 tomer is due to the mentality by mercenaries recruited by the israeli military instructors

9079347 the companies responsible of training had hurry to finish the contract in order cominciarne another and make other money in addition
9079348 he knew that the job training was to be finished quickly because the soldiers georgians were to be deployed soon in real actions
9079349 according to our standards the soldiers had capacity qausi zero and the officers were mediocre it was clear that this army lay in a conflict was absurd

9079366 biden allies note that despite his long service in washington he is at his core an outsider inside the beltway while that may well be true the optics for obama arent great he cant change the fact that in picking biden he would be going with someone who has spent nearly his entire adult life not only in politics but as a member of the worlds greatest deliberative body
9079367 our national spirit must exude joy and pleasure and say you have done well daughter of zimbabwe we are proud of you we wish you well shes our golden girl take care of her
9079368 crimea is an integral part of ukraine in contrast to the republics abkhazia and south ossetia whose citizens were not the citizens of georgia
9079369 its a great pity that they expressed support for south ossetia and abkhaziya so late complained the first secretary of the crimean communist party leader leonid grach
9079370 as always they sat and swallowed their tongue until viktor fedorovich yanukovich appeared from altai where he likes to go for a spot of r amp r and made some vague pronouncement
9079371 this acknowledgement of the independence of south ossetia and abkhaiya is hundred per cent provocation and ignores fact that similar moves can end badly said an indignant leader of rukh in crimea leonid pilunskiy in the opinion the first deputy chairman of the medzhlis refat chubarov any revision of boundaries in the post soviet space is a sure path to the destabilization of relations between all of its states

9079380 ive freelanced for 15 years and never had late fees work at best the client just pays the base amount and dares you to fight over the fees
9079381 what you do is rather than applying a discount for on time payments apply a small compounding late payment fee write it into the contract from the beginning
9079382 we are real excited how we finished before the break we had great crowds great excitement and we won two of three and that was without candice wiggins
9079383 you hope augustus continues playing well just off that adrenaline
9079384 we are definitely going to need her over these last two weeks it is going to come fast and furious when we start against washington today we play eight games in 16 days
9079385 teams are shooting 43 percent against us thats 12th or 13th or 14th in the league you cant have that for a playoff team
9079386 championship teams get the rebounds when they are to be had
9079387 is it going to be anna deforge is it going to be nicole ohlde there is always nicky if we can get three or four people in double figures that is going to help us big time
9079388 when we get the ball in candices hands or seimones hands you think the shot is going to go in last year we hit a couple of them
9079389 if they make half of those theyre substantially in the playoffs

9079398 im not one though who would attribute it to being man made
9079399 she supports more drilling in protected areas of the outer continental shelf and the alaska natural wildlife refuge once attacking mccain for his close mindedness on anwr
9079400 mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9079401 you are a liberal and you are only concerned about the benefit of individuals rather than society
9079402 some studies have even shown the acid producing potential of these types of foods is equal to what the mouth produces in response to obviously sugary solutions like a cookie or hot chocolate
9079403 the acids in these fruits break down in your mouth which causes the sting or raw spots you might get from eating too much pineapple in one sitting
9079404 the democrats in charge of this congress have been heavy on fluff and light on substance
9079405 look when most people woke up this morning they didnt know who sarah palin was
9079406 shes a hunter a lifetime nra member a hockey mom she plays hockey flies an alaskan float plane her husband is an eskimo she has an 80 percent approval rating in alaska where they dont make much bs out of their politicians
9079407 i think its kind of an insult to women for the mccain campaign to assume if they nominate a woman all the women are going to stampede away from the obama biden ticket
9079408 this is a fascinating bold and someone risky choice for john mccain
9079409 republicans dont generally tend to elevate a lot of women to higher office and to hear about a woman whos come through the pta her town council mayor then governor
9079410 youve got two senators whove never managed anything bigger than a 12 person staff
9079411 sarah palin is managing a state government so any questions about her experience should go by the wayside
9079412 when i was five months pregnant there was absolutely no question that i was with child
9079413 when they didnt want to give me a kiss or anything i said well its got to be gone
9079414 i got them each a razor and they took off the beard for me and they each started hacking away i finished it off but i let them do the first couple strokes
9079415 i really just wanted to get focused on that stick instead of concentrating on trying to lag it down there i wanted to concentrate on making that thing and i almost did
9079416 i thought i was really going to hit a little better shot than that i thought id aim it about 20 feet left of the hole and it would draw right in off that lie and i didnt want to do anything with it except let the slope dictate that shot i was surprised that it kind of came out straight and the wind was blowing right to left and it just drifted on the wind
9079417 it was one of those days where after making those putts everything seemed to look easier to me or something its tough to explain but i just tried to stay in that frame of mind when i got on the green just remembering the last putt just remember the last one how that felt and try to do the same thing i did that all the way around
9079418 it seems like ive been coming from behind all the way
9079419 obviously this was way exceeding my expectations but i just wanted to get to off a solid start and once i did that at the start of the round today i just wanted to keep that going
9079420 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9079421 after the great success of the democratic convention the choice of sarah palin is surely a hail mary pass it is a real roll of the dice and shows how john mccain karl rove et al realize what a strong position the obama biden team and democrats in general are in in this election certainly the choice of palin puts to rest any argument about inexperience on the democratic team and while palin is a fine person her lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling i particularly look forward to the biden palin debate in missouri
9079422 is this really who the republican party wants to be one heartbeat away from the presidency given sarah palins lack of experience on every front and on nearly every issue this vice presidential pick doesnt show judgment it shows political panic
9079423 i do believe that mccain has to do something to reshuffle the cards shake up the establishment do something unexpected and governor palin has all the kinds of things that mccain might see as a way to shake things up i think her selection would be something similar to dan quayle dan quayle proved to be sort of an embarrassment as a campaigner being thrust on a national stage like that could be very tough now mondale tried to shake things up by going with geraldine ferraro she proved to be a disaster as a running mate and as a campaigner she was absolutely awful and so i just think that it is very risky for mccain to do this but it may be all he has left
9079424 in choosing governor palin senator mccain is clearly trying to shore up his past maverick reformer image an image that is now in tatters due to the type of campaign hes run and the big money lobbyists he depends on every day of the week
9079425 she bills herself as a reformer but has been silent on whether she supports public financing of elections in her own state as governor of an oil producing state shes been a friend to big oil given john mccains extensive fundraising from big oil her selection raises concerns of whether the mccain palin ticket will promise the same access for oil companies and their lobbyists that weve seen for nearly eight years from the bush cheney administration
9079426 over a third of the university towns in this review experienced average house price growth of over 50 per cent in the last five years
9079427 while it can be a good investment the decision to buy a property for a son or daughter at university ultimately depends on the parents personal circumstances and property prices around the university in question
9079428 what if i put you up but promise to save your ass
9079429 ebay is working closely with the other payment vendors currently included in our accepted payments policy to include them in the permitted electronic payment methods on ebay com in early 2009 to be included they must meet fraud information security and uptime standards and complete the needed product development work to integrate into ebay checkout only propay was able to meet these requirements in time for the october payment changes we hope several others will meet the requirements by early 2009
9079430 i cant begin this great effort without honoring the achievement of geraldine ferraro in 1984 and of course hillary clinton who showed determination in her presidential campaign
9079431 it was rightly noted in denver this week that hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9079432 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9079433 both campaigns seemed to have decided that hillary clintons 18 millions voters represent a key swing bloc in this election both barack obamas speech and john mccains pick were at least partially aimed at them

9079438 well the recalls therell be a few more as we get out into the secondary processors and some of the third line
9079439 some of this product went out somewhere and other sandwiches were made out of it thats the nature of the recalls as they grow
9079440 the most important information for consumers is as we go out there we are providing further precision that informs them and lets them recognize these products in ways they werent able to do with the initial recall
9079441 it certainly does shake the confidence of consumers to know that its taking this amount of time
9079442 it just demonstrates that our need to make sure that we have absolute vigilance throughout this process is paramount
9079443 in the u s they had a legislated commitment to visit the plants daily
9079444 we took a different approach originally which meant that those tasks were applied by the inspectors spending more time in the plants though not necessarily on a daily basis
9079445 with our system we were able to pick it up with relatively small numbers otherwise it might have gone unnoticed
9079446 it helped us to connect the dots in such a way that we were able to say we have something provincially going on
9079447 if our state wanted a bridge wed build it ourselves

9079451 we do want to have forums for our users to communicate and support each other
9079452 it doesnt necessarily mean that theyre helping elevate the good questions and helping the conversation come through
9079453 weve thought about this as well and it would be really cool if we could start to group different events around you
9079454 a few projects on the way think 2009 realistically for some of this stuff

9079466 its my biggest jump and i landed a very nice one im really pushing it in my programs this year
9079467 she landed three triple jumps and just overall made a big impression in her first international

9079480 if they make half of those theyre substantially in the playoffs
9079481 yeah it would mean a lot for us to win on a big track like this
9079482 mile and a half and above tracks and downforce tracks have been kind of our weak spot
9079483 weve been making a lot of gains hopefully we made some gains that will help us this weekend and moving into the chase
9079484 it just started the confidence in our minds that were ready for the chase
9079485 the top five guys in the points have a very good point of view or mind set theyre going to be in the chase so youre looking at what you need to do to be as good as you can in the chase and building the confidence around yourself and the team that you can be a contender

9079497 while usage caps may help comcast out of a jam theyre not the best long term solution for users or for the market it could slow broadband adoption and stall innovation heres a novel suggestion if supply is a problem why not increase capacity
9079498 the caps are a move to ensure that the gouging scheme put in place by comcast and other cable providers stays intact and they can continue to sell their video on demand services
9079499 usage based pricing would be a welcome development for broadband providers and would be the simplest manifestation yet of what we believe is still the primary truth of the broadband market that is that demand is rising at a time when relevant supply is actually shrinking

9079506 because the state demonstrated that the method utilized in investigating lyons suspected dui was trustworthy accurate and fair i would reinstate the sensible decision of the city trial court and uphold the convictions in this case
9079507 the only way a defendant can have due process is if the defendant has the opportunity to make sure the accuracy of the intoxilizer instrument is in fact accurate
9079508 under the circumstances of this case we think lyons alternative remedy a new trial at which the state will be precluded from introducing evidence of lyons bac is far more appropriate

9079621 a metaphor for the terrors of intimacy thats one of the reasons vampires have been such a potent metaphor and mythological motif for centuries they show up in pretty much all cultures its the notion of separating that part which keeps us safe and separate from another person both emotionally and physically and how there is a certain loss of self that takes place when there is true intimacy and i think thats really healthy but it doesnt mean its not scary

9079654 la plantilla est comprometida es fuerte y sabe lo que quiere en el campo
9079655 el valladolid se ha reforzado bastante bien y ser un rival peligroso me preocupa que hayan sacado dos resultados tan buenos ante el villarreal y athletic
9079656 lo siento pero no creo mucho en los partidos de pretemporada solo sirven para inyectar confianza a los jugadores cuando ganas

9079662 when all those other cities were getting populated and built on we were still growing food here to eat we still had families that were feeding themselves because they couldnt afford food except for what they could grow
9079663 the actual phenomenon of urban farming is absolutely taking off even more
9079664 people are worried about the environment the rising cost of food people feel safer about their food being grown closer to home
9079665 it kind of opens up peoples imaginations of what can be done closer to home
9079666 its a draw to bring people to your cities and its something that should be preserved
9079667 why cant they leave the farmland alone on the valley floor the loss of agricultural water and farmland is a major threat to the continuation of farming
9079668 if we could encourage one city block to have each neighbour plant a fruit tree in a few years they would have more fruit than they would know what to do with
9079669 this isnt about subsistence farming its about creating healthy communities

9079675 hes one of my two favourite stories in the book hes manic and he comes across as manic
9079676 people probably wont know gerry but the truth of the matter is theyve probably gone to see something gerrys put on theyve probably seen a rolling stones show or u2 or gone to see david bowie or whomever
9079677 shes remarkable just because shes such an interesting personality and has so many interests wine photography architecture and corporate governance
9079678 and you probably learn something about the guy at some point whether you learn everything about his business or not you learn something more important you learn about the guy himself you learn about what makes him tick what interests him
9079679 he hits it right across the water right at the green and he makes it across just a dead yank

9079681 you know all these guys are competitive you know thats how they got to where they are but rarely do you see it demonstrated in such a clear way
9079682 in a corporate setting you and i are never going to see how that comes out because were never going to be invited when theyre negotiating a 30 million deal to take something over
9079683 the tricky part about it for me is how do you play a halfway decent golf game take notes and think up questions to continue the conversation

9079692 sarah palin for her entire political career has been underestimated
9079693 shes tough shes tenacious i believe that she does have what it takes to get out there again her ability to connect with voters and make a case is very very very strong
9079694 definitely i can compete with these girls i dont think the gaps are as big as i once thought
9079695 i go out on court and i feel i have a chance against them today i definitely feel i had a chance it just didnt come together in the way i would have liked it to
9079696 i think shes probably the best british player that i ever played
9079697 she has a very good potential shes very aggressive and she has a good serve the whole game is pretty good
9079698 i just felt i hit too many errors on routine points routine shots

9079733 we wanted a show where the music was relevant to the culture at large and not just within the confines of the musical theater
9079734 my immediate thought was spring awakening it was 1999 everyone was having millennial thoughts and i thought a great way to look forward would be by looking back this story just struck my heart

9079738 wedekind was about adolescent angst the way adolescents now deal with their angst is they listen to indie rock and emo so what better way of channeling the angst of 1891 german kids than to send them into this kind of alternate reality where they become rock stars in their bedrooms
9079739 we were trying to make sure that what we did had integrity
9079740 and was progressive and was true to the spirit of frank wedekind but was yes trying to bring a new audience to the theater
9079741 i love the fact that the brackets of musical theater are being expanded

9079743 the experience of becoming an adult and moving out of childhood transcends time and place

9079767 i swore that the book would stay buried i also swore that it would be avenged
9079768 in the last days of 2006 i was still smarting over the past november nanowrimos sophomore slump had hit me a year late leaving me well aware of the 50 000 word thing hanging out on my hard drive disheartened and perhaps a bit delusional i swore that the book would stay buried i also swore that it would be avenged now a spark had hit me midway through nano 06 but due to poor timing it found itself ignored it returned in the chills of winter and was again brushed off by the petulance of an annoyed writer the plucky little thing continued to surface from time to time until in june of 2007 and against my better judgment at the time i was not aware of the magic of outlining i sat down and spent some quality time with pen and paper come november i had a full flung plot on my hands i picked up my december promise and threw myself into writing after wrapping on november 30th i tucked the manuscript away to let it steep and to let my fingers cool in february i did a fly by edit but as a high school senior i had to focus on college deadlines in march i perked up the first few chapters and submitted them to the novel contest hosted by scholastic press and its imprint push it wasnt so much that i expected a win but i felt guilty for having neglected writing contests all through my high school career fast forward at the end of april just as i was getting through the door after work my mother told me that i had a message from my college and needed to call back i rang the number and was baffled when the answering machine picked up and it wasnt the university admissions office after all i left a rather awkward i admit message then went to check my email i found a letter from scholastic as my eyes swept down the page i saw three things that made my jaw drop contest this isnt a joke congratulations i collected enough of my wits to actually read the letter then immediately lost them all over again and started babbling to my brother in the next room the funny part my mother really wasnt trying to be coy about the whole college thing it was just a communication breakdown so now ill be working to edit my novel with the help of david levithan i am obviously thrilled about this and know all too well that a big part of the opportunity is owed to nanowrimo and its uncanny ability to whip my muse into shape id like to thank everyone who has ever contributed to nano including the forum members and of course all of the remarkable people behind the scenes see you again in november

9079783 we couldnt sell any motherboards to windows users just linux bsd solaris

9079785 but we cant stop it now we have taken orders
9079786 let me tell you what you are going to do 1 you are going to raise the price to 400 instead of 200 2 then you are going to offer a windows xp version for 395 3 then you are going to make a larger version that will actually work with xp
9079787 but our original version is underpowered and doeesnt have enough storage for xp and office
9079788 too bad our customers have to become used to much less performance havent you tried vista yet and you leave the storage problem to us once we trim out all the useless crap xp will fit so will office it will still be slow but who cares

9079807 it was a good outing for us im proud with the way our guys didnt give up after giving up an early goal
9079808 we were able to play a lot of guys which helped us stay fresh and i really thought we looked in better shape
9079809 there was a lot of action down in front of the goal and he just layed out for it
9079810 we had some other scoring opportunities and so did they but his score really was remarkable they put up a lot of shots but only a handful were legitimate scoring threats
9079811 the 55 year old victim was given emergency first aid at the scene but was pronounced dead

9079822 as a principal it was the worst news i could have gotten that out of all the elementary schools we were last
9079823 you know i get a lot of requests at wal mart and when this principal approached me she told me about a need and low test scores
9079824 when she gave me the 500 i added and got 625 worth of gift cards to motivate my kids
9079825 knowing they were going to get that card if they finished and answered every question i saw children looking back through the book and i think they were really more motivated
9079826 we were last county in elementary with our scores and you all worked so hard and answered all the questions so you could get a wal mart card
9079827 what a success story and if we can help children succeed and maybe set the stage for success then theres nothing better than that
9079828 so they worked hard because not only were they paid well through good grades but were going to get a bonus by getting a 25 gift card from wal mart

9079837 he hargreaves trained on the night before the game with the rest of the team but when he came to us in the morning he said he was still feeling his knee
9079838 he felt that he wasnt fit enough to play and after that theres nothing more you can do if the player decides himself you have to accept it
9079839 we would like to have played him and got him back into things because he hasnt had enough football in the last year
9079840 we need to get him back and we are disappointed hes been training with the first team for 10 days and as i say theres nothing more we can do we gave him the right preparation his training programmes were at the right tempo the right speed of training everything was done in the right manner to get him back for this game so thats the disappointment
9079841 the sending off was unfortunate but the fact he had already been booked meant he had to go
9079842 could not wait to get them in at the break
9079843 i cant deny that zenit deserved to win we played better when we were 2 0 down and we created quite a few chances to score but i have to say that zenit shaded it
9079844 the way we played tonight was superb and we definitely deserved the victory
9079845 in fact i am surprised we did not score more goals
9079846 we hope there will be a fair and equal distribution of the budget taking into account the welfare of partially aided schools
9079847 while we await the decision to turn all partially aided schools into fully aided ones the budget will help to cover maintenance and administration costs for the schools
9079848 nutp is glad that school infrastructures will be upgraded and new schools built to replace those in a dilapidated condition as this would ensure the safety of students and teachers
9079849 we had asked for a special subsidy for petrol and an increase in the cost of living allowance cola for teachers however we are still pleased that a big chunk of the budget was set aside to improve the quality of education
9079850 almost 60 per cent of the primary schools here are located in rural areas and 40 per cent of those schools have no electricity or water
9079851 an additional rm1 billion compared with last years rm30 billion allocation is welcome building new schools and training more teachers can put a stop to overcrowded schools as the ratio of students to teachers is on the increase
9079852 the pintar programme is an excellent move to involve more companies in uplifting the standard of education
9079853 while democracy allows for the expression of different views we must however remain united on fundamental issues of national interest
9079854 we are not opposed to any increase in taxation but we were hoping that the government would seriously consider the impact that high tax will have on the illicit tobacco trade problem that we are currently facing
9079855 we were not looking for zero tax increase as we understand the governments need to increase tax revenue for its many projects to help the people especially the poor and underprivileged and for development
9079856 we were just hoping that it would not be double digit again to ease volumes pressure due to down trading to illegal cigarettes
9079857 at three sen per stick and 60 sen per pack of 20s the excise increase is 20 per cent
9079858 currently 24 9 per cent of cigarettes sold in malaysia are illegal this is an increase of 73 per cent from 2004 levels
9079859 high excise imposed will only result in a high tax led cigarette price leading more and more consumers who are already experiencing inflationary pressures to turn to illegal cigarettes
9079860 we are also concerned that if the illegal cigarette segment continues to grow demand for duty paid cigarettes will continue to drop and when volume is affected the demand for local leaves will drop and affect the livelihood of tobacco farmers
9079861 we think that an overall 60 sen increase per packet of 20s would not be a deterring factor for tobacco consumption
9079862 the impact is very small its peanuts every month ktb spends rm3 million on diesel alone this is apart from the subsidised diesel so a rm280 reduction does not help us
9079863 why do we still have to pay road tax when the government has increased the price of petrol and diesel they should just abolish road tax
9079864 the government needs to clarify this will the stage buses have to pay more now
9079865 the public has suffered for a long time its about time we have a proper commission to improve the public transport service

9079892 as far as most things are concerned the maritime segment is on a par with the aerospace segment
9079893 it is only that most people view the air show as more glamorous because of all the aircraft
9079894 lets face it seeing jet aircraft screaming through the sky is a lot more exciting than looking at static ships and boats
9079895 but hw lima has done a wonderful job in bringing the maritime show to such a level through its organisational skills diligent work and efficiency
9079896 this coupled with the fact that there had been some problems over the years with the organisation of the aerospace segment made the government believe hw lima should be given a chance to organise the entire show
9079897 they may not have the expertise where aerospace is concerned but the government believes this will not be a problem
9079898 they have shown efficiency in whatever they do so they are being given the chance to show that they can bring the lima series to even greater heights

9079933 despite challenges from the opposition and the unstable world economy malaysias economy remains strong and resilient
9079934 the bn government which had been given the mandate by the people on march 8 will continue to safeguard political stability and enhance the economic prosperity of the nation
9079935 we cannot allow uncertainties to continue as this will affect foreign investment economic sentiment and the capital markets
9079936 i know from the way they called me merdeka that they were poking fun at me after calling my name they would smile and laugh

9079938 friends did not joke about my name but they were curious to know why my parents gave me such a name i explained the reasons to them and they understood
9079939 during my time at the university i learned that the name was actually a great name and only a few people had it since then i have never thought of changing it
9079940 for instance a name like syawal will remind us of hari raya

9079952 they should be able to compete and consumers stand to benefit weve received numerous complaints about the high cost of living and increased price of goods so this move will definitely be beneficial to consumers
9079953 whether they sign or not that is secondary whats important is whats in their hearts we will depend on their loyalty to bn and on their integrity
9079954 the amount is so little you might as well not give it those bedridden and in wheelchairs require a lot of money for medical fees

9079967 it was all prerecorded and the mso melbourne symphony orchestra did record a minority of the music that was performed
