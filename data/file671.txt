6710191 ponemos el acento en el combate al chovinismo de gran jan hay que combatir tambi n el nacionalismo local pero este por lo com n no es el blanco principal en el pasado los gobernantes reaccionarios sobre todo los de la nacionalidad jan levantaron toda clase de barreras entre las diversas nacionalidades y atropellaron a las minor as nacionales las consecuencias de todo esto no son f ciles de liquidar en corto tiempo ni siquiera dentro del pueblo trabajador el aire del espacio los bosques de la tierra y las riquezas del subsuelo son todos importantes elementos indispensables para la construcci n del socialismo pero ning n factor material puede ser explotado y aprovechado sino por el factor hombre debemos trabajar porque haya buenas relaciones entre la nacionalidad jan y las minor as nacionales y consolidar la unidad entre ellas para edificar nuestra gran patria socialista con los esfuerzos de todos

6710298 why in the world would we need to deploy our missiles in syria against whom we have no enemies in the region
6710299 we understand russias stance regarding the breakaway regions and understand that it came in retaliation to georgian provocation
6710300 the timing of assads visit is very important it happens at the time when russia is very angry at the united states
6710301 it is highly possible that russia being so angered by the west and the united states now may sell something very nasty to syria

6710325 beginning in 2005 we started noticing a pronounced loss of kegs during our annual audit by anheuser busch
6710326 distributors are billed for the missing kegs city beverage was not alone in the significant funds we expended to replace the stolen kegs it is an industry wide problem
6710327 because of our relationship with sister companies city beverage and kalamazoo beer distributing fpt quickly became involved in spreading awareness to our industry the wide ranging portfolio of companies allowed us to gain knowledge of the growing number of keg thefts early on
6710328 if there is no available market the kegs will be returned to the retailer and ultimately the distributor
6710329 all kegs are stamped with the owners name anyone attempting to redeem them will have to prove ownership
6710330 this new law will help us to get our arms around this problem
6710331 our ongoing and historical policy is not to accept kegs

6710339 questo trofeo stato un buon test mi piaciuta la determinazione della squadra e anche i giovani che hanno giocato stasera sono andati bene ha detto ancelotti inzaghi uscito a met del primo tempo per un piccolo problema muscolare adesso abbiamo ancora una decina di giorni perch la squadra possa arrivare al meglio alla prima sfida di campionato contro il bologna

6710342 in the companies that i represent in the manufacturing sphere most of the pay negotiations have been concluded and successfully concluded
6710343 we have been in protracted negotiations with the company in relation to this years pay and we have had a failure to agree on the companys offer
6710344 we have been working closely with the company over the past 18 months on lean manufacturing and have made 3m in savings at the monkstown plant now is the time our members are paid back for all their efforts
6710345 we went to a ballot and the members felt that the only alternative open to them was to take industrial action in pursuance of their claim
6710346 i dont believe that we are that far away from securing a deal but its always the last hurdle that can bring the greatest problems
6710347 there are a number of the top 10 residential developers who are members of the group plus also very significant suppliers to the industry
6710348 we know we are dealing with a substantial level of debt and huge businesses its hard to see how the industry will survive in its current shape unless there is accommodation some companies will fail
6710349 more recently we are seeing that that is filtering on through into surveyors solicitors planners suppliers and everyone else involved in the sector
6710350 we have been promised a meeting with the finance minister nigel dodds to look at the social housing provision and co ownership housing urgent action is needed to prevent total market failure
6710351 this is the first time in many many years there has been such a major social housing development programme which will be constructed over the next three years
6710352 so there is an opportunity out there for the development of the construction industry in northern ireland

6710358 we are trying to manage in a spare straightforward way
6710359 were trying to fulfill our commitments but we dont have a lot of cash at the moment
6710360 we feel that this is the closest thing to our mission in terms of educating the public about horticulture
6710361 we are planning to have it in some form or another the location may be different the size may be different the timing may be different
6710362 ive picked up more hours this summer trying to make the money back its hard to think that theyd just turn on you like this
6710363 i cant make it a gift to them i dont even have that much in taxes
6710364 there has been a lot of mismanagement on a lot of levels
6710365 the fact is what we the board of trustees saw on paper was not the actual state of affairs
6710366 its not easily done but its certainly one of the considerations
6710367 but we need to find a way to keep it that way it came at a price
6710368 we had a great quiet come to jesus kind of conversation with each other
6710369 we were both feeling like there was some blood on the floor after the casino vote
6710370 we agreed to apologize for some of the things both of us said and we agreed to put the past behind us we decided to get back to work together to get back to being friends
6710371 we have seen over the last several months a lot more willingness to compromise and willingness to take his lumps and move on
6710372 that strikes me as reflective of hard work and the word that comes to mind is maturity
6710373 sometimes it is a guy thing like the new kid on the block
6710374 now they get along very well they have both gone through a lot
6710375 in the last couple of months he has shown all the intellectual and political skills as well as the courage that i saw in him as a candidate
6710376 it took a while to get his feet under him it is certainly very encouraging
6710377 i agree the past is the past lets move forward in partnership and friendship
6710378 hes a human being i know that was affecting him
6710379 we talked often through that sometimes you just pick up the phone in the morning on the way in and check in hes done the same for me
6710380 people are very much encouraged by the new face of the campaign because they were not happy with the original theory of im not going to be aggressive im not going to attack
6710381 everybody felt that if he did that he would have a tough time winning
6710382 the presumption that i am blessed with such personal greatness that history has anointed me to save my country in its hour of need
6710383 they went ahead and laid the foundation under rick and it was time to whack somebody under steve
6710384 life in the spotlight must be grand but for the rest of us times are tough
6710385 once he joined the club the advertising changed and immediately they got with drawing the distinctions
6710386 i know schmidts got a rule that you do positive and negative at the same time but i havent seen much of the positive
6710387 just by mccain being mccain and giving the answers he does hell reassure a lot of people
6710388 i will guarantee you that metrowest legislators will do everything in our power to keep the turnpike authority from singling out metrowest commuters for a toll increase which is what the effect would be of removing the discount program
6710389 i understand the turnpike authority is in a very difficult fiscal situation but eliminating the fast lane discount should be off the table
6710390 we are the most affected its patently unfair that the metrowest has to bear this burden to begin with to pay for the big dig
6710391 the authority is at or close to bleeding red ink
6710392 they need to look at ways to close the gap between revenues and expenses
6710393 but this is an equity issue for metrowest commuters and i think they have a valid concern
6710394 we want to have the tools to fix the problem in case the fishery collapses
6710395 what is your survival rate that was really really hard to prove
6710396 this is going to make sure the lobsters are there for us in the future
6710397 emphasises the importance that i place on driving through improved standards
6710398 the inspections will challenge hygiene practice in our hospitals at ward level on a regular basis and inform the actions that trusts now need to take to address the identified shortcomings
6710399 i am confident that we can continue to improve hygiene standards and raise public confidence in the quality of care provided by our hospitals
6710400 trusts have already addressed much of the rqia recommendations and the rolling programme of rqia inspections will ensure that progress is sustained
6710401 staff are working hard to stop the spread of hospital infections and no one should be concerned about using our hospitals
6710402 we all have a part to play by ensuring that when we visit a hospital we strictly observe the hygiene standards and we strictly respect visiting policies
6710403 that somebody would not be found would send shudders up your spine to think that you could be so unimportant and lie for a long time without anybody missing you in this day and age it is unbelievable it proves that all of us should pay more attention to our neighbours and be a better neighbour ourselves
6710404 whatever marks background he didnt deserve to be hacked to death in the street
6710405 the people who killed mark murdered him for their own selfish reasons and not for the greater good of the people of kilcooley or the north down area
6710406 i would ask anyone who knows anything about what happened in owenroe drive two years ago to come forward

6710733 it is important that we succeed in this world cup because nothing less is required than to open the door for the last major event on the continent the olympics
6710734 will be hosted in south africa by south africans and nowhere else
6710735 we at fifa are working very hard in south africa with south africa to ensure that the world cup will happen in south africa
6710736 the world cup is such an important event for us it pays for the rest of all our events and we have to make sure that it is a success
6710737 the south african government is spending close to r33 billion and that infrastructure will remain for south africans to utilise beyond 2010
6710738 to assess our capability to deal with any form of crime including anti terrorism tests and public order policing

6710757 his plan and his focus were to make it back this year
6710758 obviously he worked extremely hard to put himself in this position
6710759 i tried to pull back and get out of the way when i saw the ball it was about a foot away
6710760 weve hit for the last 31 2 years we have a lot of the same guys i know they can hit but i cant exactly tell you when were going to get going
6710761 its a little surprising but its probably out of my jurisdiction
6710762 without a doubt i think every guy in that room in there knows were better than how weve been playing

6710769 does it matter if weve lost 10 in a row to the marlins if we beat them in the last eight
6710770 no the only thing that matters is the last game you win the next win thats all that matters we dont care how weve played against people
6710771 i think the guys are up for the challenge they know august and september is what separates the boys from the men theyre looking forward to payback we lost our first series to the dodgers in l a i think weve got to take care of home field advantage hopefully this time it goes our way but as far as our record with things weve done before we cant control that its over and done with

6710775 due to the current rift between the united states and russia the possibility of these two countries cooperating in the short term in the security council over irans nuclear issue is unlikely iranian officials will try to take advantage of this situation and gain as many concessions as possible from the 5 1 group before reaching a conclusion with the group
6710776 russia is basically against a nuclear iran and will eventually cooperate with the united states to curb irans enrichment program
6710777 no substantial changes are envisaged in moscows policy toward irans nuclear issue
6710778 though russia might delay a decision on the next security council resolution or reduce the level of further sanctions that may be imposed on iran
6710779 it is striking to me that anyone would believe that russia is involved in trying to keep iran from getting a nuclear weapon as a favor to the united states
6710780 seriously limit its response to georgia to avoid a russian counter in iran

6710786 we continue to put ourselves in position day in and day out to win games
6710787 we have a good team we have good chemistry a lot of things are really working in our favor right now
6710788 it was a big win for us were really confident weve been able to find a way to win ballgames that is something we werent doing early in the year
6710789 doubleplay wed get wright at second too he had taken off he was halfway home cant fault him i mean ball gets in the lights you cant see it

6710792 i want him just to go out there and be himself and have the composure that hes always had and throw strikes
6710793 if somebody hits the ball hard keep working keep working on what he does best thats how hes been doing it for a year and a half now
6710794 its like hitters in a slump its just something that pitchers go through where all of a sudden you are trying to pitch away from contact
6710795 i dont know why it happens its just something im going to be really conscious of going out there tonight attacking the strike zone getting ahead getting strike one and strike two and making them hit my pitch instead of falling behind 2 0 and obviously they know a fastball is coming
6710796 i think its very important that you have to show a lot of confidence in him
6710797 if you look hes been real good for us because hes gotten hit a few games doesnt mean that i have to show that im concerned about him
6710798 i just know i need to make every start possible wherever it lines up it lines up i think the matchups are more for the playoffs than anything during the season matchups are pretty irrelevant because you play teams so often and because we have five guys who i believe every single one will get the job done
6710799 i know you can not tell but they actually do im a real redhead from the hair on my head to the pubes on my cookie but since its bikini season i bald them all off after this barbeque im have to skinny dip in the pool so i wanted my pussy to be worthy and smooth not only does it look pretty shaved but it feels excellent when the cold water touches my bare lips
6710800 who cares i wanna get naked if they talk crap about me it is just cause theyre jealous most of the people here know i can be a little wild anyway i am an exhibitionist and half of my friends have seen me naked some people think that is lascivious of me but i think they secretly wish they could be as comfortable in their skin as im in mine i look worthy and i enjoy being naked so why not and my cunt needs some room to breathe too it gets suffocated from being trapped in my tender little panties all day long
6710801 on paper for you guys its probably a team that we should beat
6710802 theyre competitive they didnt back down i think at all in this series regardless of what their record is they are professional baseball players and they are going to give you a battle
6710803 they got some breaks and took advantage of them tonight
6710804 its a little surprising but its probably out of my jurisdiction
6710805 im not a hitter so youre probably asking the wrong guy
6710806 all of a sudden it seems like we cant get anything going
6710807 it seems like everything we do doesnt work for us i think our guys know exactly what they have to do and they know how many games we have left and they know where were at and they know what we have to do to win i think were definitely trying

6710812 for nemo producing al qaeda propaganda has become a way of life
6710813 he has compiled so much relevant ideological material and made it so widely available that thinking of him as a simple propagandist would be understating the contribution that hes made for groups like al qaeda
6710814 it is intended to give a more local look to the sinister plans
6710815 russia informed us through military channels that the russian federation defense ministry decided to stop the military cooperation international events scheduled between russia and the nato states until further instructions
6710816 there are sexual predators in the world no one questions that but contrary to the hysterical clamor over the issue the rate of such offenses has been declining for years even at its height the chances of being a victim to such a predator was relatively low this of course doesnt stop police officers from fanning the flames of fear it is in their interests to do so its good for the budgets and a wonderful way to convince politicians who dont need much convincing to give them even more extreme powers one of these professional fear mongers is police officer john gay of the cheyenne wy police department his tactic is to go into schools and humiliate intimidate and embarrass young girls maybe its just me but he sounds like something of a sexual predator himself one who gets off on humiliating women
6710817 when you read the preamble to the declaration of independence remember what the world looked like to the men who wrote it then look at our world through their eyes understanding their world and the institutions they used routinely brings understanding of what has gone so wrong with our world today their world was the same and different the agreement to go to war came after a long process of discourse over the issues not by leaders but by ordinary people the committees of correspondence drove a dialogue on why the people should govern themselves enacting formally what they had been doing for two centuries they were a people who expected to cooperate looking across into each others eyes never up to anyone in government

6710841 dies hat nichts mit der situation in georgien zu tun
6710842 in keiner weise sind die raketenabwehrpl ne des pr sidenten gegen russland gerichtet
6710843 der zweck der abwehrraketen besteht darin unsere europ ischen verb ndeten vor bedrohungen durch schurkenstaaten zu sch tzen
6710844 entgegen der offiziellen version von ministerpr sident tusk und des us au enministeriums spielte der krieg in georgien eine entscheidende rolle bei der beschleunigung der polnisch amerikanischen vertragsverhandlungen ber die abwehrraketen der krieg war der letzte ansto f r tusk seine zustimmung zu dem abkommen zu geben
6710845 sollte der raketenschild tats chlich der abwehr iranischer raketen dienen so w re der russische kompromissvorschlag ein gemeinsames abfangsystem in aserbaidschan zu errichten weit besser daf r geeignet denn dort stationierte abfangraketen k nnten iranische raketen bereits am beginn ihrer flugbahn treffen und zerst ren
6710846 dass die usa diesen kompromissvorschlag ausgeschlagen haben l sst nur einen schluss zu der raketenschild richtet sich in erster linie nicht gegen den iran sondern gegen russland dies wird auch dadurch unterstrichen dass die anderen basen des raketenschildes ebenfalls in grenzregionen zu russland wie beispielsweise alaska stationiert sind
6710847 die strategische bedeutung des systems besteht darin jene paar dutzend raketen abzufangen die moskau nach einem amerikanischen berraschungsangriff noch f r einen zweitschlag zur verf gung st nden der raketenschild ist also ein entscheidender faktor in dem bem hen eine nukleare erstschlagkapazit t gegen ber russland aufzubauen zwar ist zun chst geplant nur zehn abfangraketen in polen zu stationieren doch sofern das system erst einmal errichtet ist k nnte deren zahl leicht erh ht werden
6710848 dieser artikel f hrt einem vor augen worin die wirkliche funktion des raketenschilds besteht er soll den usa die f higkeit sichern einen atomkrieg zu f hren ohne selbst von gegenschl gen getroffen zu werden w re diese f higkeit erst einmal erworben so lie e sie sich als geopolitisches druckmittel einsetzen um nationale interessen durchzusetzen
6710849 durch die stationierung setzt sich polen ganz klar einem gegenschlag aus

6710870 it is very unfair that you can classify a dog on its breed and not its history
6710871 if we did this with people it would be called racism
6710872 the time was right a year or so ago in that as part of our succession planning i discussed with the board that at the end of this year no matter what happens it is right to change
6710873 i couldve done it longer but i think sometimes you need to let others enjoy it and take that next step
6710874 the decision in my mind would be this is the right time im confident some of the issues were handling some of the directions were going are very positive
6710875 im excited about next year im looking forward to coming along and being able to watch the footy and enjoy it i think weve got an outstanding coach in mark williams an outstanding group of players great footy support and quite frankly we can only go up next year
6710876 we know weve got a significant supporter base of about 340 350 000 compared to perhaps the bigger clubs like collingwood at 650 000
6710877 i dont think our supporter base overnight is going to jump to 600 000 i say jokingly to people its like changing religions people dont do it very easily your parents influence what you do its a very long term issue
6710878 ive had so much back luck this year i was just hoping it would change and today it has its a great feeling to do so much racing
6710879 the cancellation of the memorandum of agreement is a painful step in our collective effort to come to an agreement with the milf
6710880 will seek a new agreement within the boundaries of law set within the constitution
6710881 furthermore the president will not allow adventurism by milf forces to pressure the government to sign any agreement even if it is for peace
6710882 we have already initialed the memorandum of agreement on the ancestral domain we will not revisit or renegotiate the agreement
6710883 they surrendered because they could no longer take the inhuman instructions and atrocities committed by commander bravo
6710884 arming syria would lead to a strategic change and could destabilize the middle east and the world
6710885 we are indeed prepared to sell only defensive weapons which do not violate the regional balance of power
6710886 why in the world would we need to deploy our missiles in syria against whom we have no enemies in the region
6710887 we understand russias stance regarding the breakaway regions and understand that it came in retaliation to georgian provocation
6710888 the timing of assads visit is very important it happens at the time when russia is very angry at the united states
6710889 it is highly possible that russia being so angered by the west and the united states now may sell something very nasty to syria

6710893 you have a meeting and anyone interested should come and present yourself to the public then there could be a final meeting

6710902 two hundred and fifty 300 metres to go everything just kicked into gear and i thought theres the finish line i better get moving
6710903 why is there such a gap between perception and reality perhaps because people have been told again and again that open land is disappearing england has no lack of open space even if urban areas were expanded by 10 per cent this could be achieved by using less than one per cent of the total land mass that would still leave 89 per cent of the country untouched by development
6710904 i got to the page where the reference was made to a toffeenosed twit
6710905 on the next page the word changed i thought i was mistaken but i saw to my shock it had been repeated twice again
6710906 i did not expect this from a well respected author and do not want my young niece to have to see this obscene slang
6710907 the owls and bats cowls and twats monks and nuns in a cloisters moods
6710908 theyd talkt of his having a cardinalls hat theyd send him as soon an old nuns twat
6710909 i do not think it is felt to be the worst swear word in the language it is used to mean a mere fool without any indication of what its original meaning is i am a bit surprised that it has been taken out
6710910 the publisher is aware of the word that is featured in the book and has agreed that its not appropriate for children and will be reprinting copies as soon as these copies are available we will stock them in our stores
6710911 we are very sorry if anyone is offended by the language jacqueline wilson aims to reflect the realities of modern life in the context of the character we felt the word was used in a way that accurately portrayed how children like jodie and her friends would speak to each other we have sold over 150 000 copies of the book since march this year and have only received three complaints
6710912 the new york suit was successful and very similar so were hoping that case will set precedent
6710913 the earlier ruling of the court that there really wasnt a binding right to a quality education had put a roadblock in the path of any lawsuits
6710914 these cases always have a way of staying alive in one way or another
6710915 we have to play like coach samson siasia told us and not have everyone trying to do something special
6710916 we have to make sure we dont give them room to operate
6710917 messi is going to be a handful we know that but if you shut off the supply to messi it makes it more difficult for him
6710918 we actually gave that game up ourselves with the two penalties but this team has grown and now we have more experience
6710919 hopefully it will turn out how i say so that the boys can win the gold medal because they deserve it
6710920 but be careful nigeria are a good team we have to respect them but i am very confident in this team and in checho coach sergio batista

6710942 first step 1 purchase a gps system prices continue to drop which reduces the chance of getting lost and wasting fuel step 2 replace standard gps voices with pigtones gps voices that will definitely increase the smiles per gallon
6710943 its amazing how so few people knew that garmin gps and tom tom gps systems systems can have their standard voices so easily replaced of course we want pigtones to do for gps what ringtones did for cell phones
6710944 well we do call ourselves pigtones as in politically incorrect gps do we expect heat sure but if we can help someone get over any road rage by adding a few laughs to their trip itll all be worth it besides we are an equal opportunity offender we even have a contest that lets the driving public decide who we parody next

6710957 there is a biological reason why the mother whale abandoned it but weve tried the best we could since day one to do the best we could for the whale
6710958 normally the births take place up in the sheltered warm waters in the great barrier reef and the calves have time to develop and gain some confidence and experience before they start their journey south
6710959 that depends on how big fannie and freddie blow up
6710960 some hit is going to come from existing preferred shareholders
6710961 theres not protection for shareholders of common or preferred shares
6710962 while some companies will probably have some writedowns i dont think theres a widespread effect on the whole industry
6710963 we didnt know where we were to be honest we really have been working on the last 150 metres of our race
6710964 so many times weve been in close finishes and we have been in fourth fifth or sixth and we just didnt want that to happen again
6710965 these early indicators of success are the result of the hard work and commitment that our young people parents and teachers have demonstrated in the build up to these exams
6710966 perhaps schools are focusing on quality rather than quantity they are recognising that there is no benefit to pupils to do 11 or 12 gcses it is better to have eight or nine good gcses
6710967 ahmed and the others got a call about five minutes before saying they were coming they went to hide in the lift but ahmed got separated they were on the 14th floor and came down
6710968 after they came out they were shouting to him they are in the building come down come down these other guys then knew he was in there two ran all the way up one of the boys actually saw it he is really scared
6710969 ahmed and his brother sold weed the others sell harder drugs that was a note to them to come off the streets or we will get you one by one
6710970 hackney is crack city there are syringes everywhere these guys saw they were making money other people saw this they would ride around in private cabs
6710971 it is a drug war i used to sell weed myself i know these people a big guy who they get their stuff off had been warned a few weeks ago to stop doing it but they didnt these guys didnt want ahmed but the others he got caught in it
6710972 he never used to go out he was happy staying at home but in the past few months he started going out a lot and hanging around the estate
6710973 we cant speculate on any of these theories at this point everything will be considered as part of the investigation
6710974 the bank needs to prevent a fairly shallow recession from getting worse
6710975 we anticipate the support for todays stoppage to be as strong as previous strikes so would advise the public to avoid taking to the sea for non essential activities
6710976 strike action is a last resort for our members who provide an invaluable service in ensuring the safety of shipping in british waters the latest action could have been avoided if the government and the mca hadnt continued with their refusal to negotiate a satisfactory outcome
6710977 members have rightly grown angry at the scandalous refusal to pay them the same as other emergency service workers and by the governments policy to cap public sector pay increases below inflation this has led to watch assistants having to receive a special pay rise simply to bring them up to the level of the national minimum wage
6710978 the agency is absolutely committed to maintaining the safety of life at sea detailed contingency plans will be in place and although our services will be more limited than usual the public should know that distress calls will be answered as normal
6710979 its an incredible feeling to be olympic champion its been a long time coming

6710998 six tibetan separatists showed the flag of the separatist movement and cried slogans

6711000 clearly it does appear from the information we have got there was some kind of confusion between who was protesting and the media who were within regulations endeavoring to cover that protest
6711001 so many criticisms in this room just reflects how biased some of the media are about china how little some of the media understand china

6711008 we encourage the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights including freedom of expression and freedom of religion of all people during the olympic games

6711044 i think weve heard all through our competitions ever since we started theres no doubt the u s has a very strong team
6711045 the fact that there is a new olympic gold medalist is huge for softball
6711046 we have new nations that are making their presence known on the world stage and i think thats really big for softball
6711047 weve got to keep after it were in competition with six other sports
6711048 some people actually came to me and said i didnt understand if i was voting for baseball or softball and one vote if it was more carefully done it wouldve helped softball

6711297 a proposal to introduce congestion tax is before the government as traffic jams have become a frequent phenomenon in the city it is the only alternative besides checking proliferation of private cars it also promotes public transport
6711298 if congestion tax is introduced in a five kilometer radius from the main transit center in majestic most of them will have no means other than metro as paying congestion tax to travel by car in core areas of the city would cost them heavily they would certainly use the metro introduction of congestion tax also means to get back the investment made on the metro by encouraging public travel
6711299 the proposal is on the cards but i cant say when it would be introduced
6711300 more people travelling in metro rail will compensate the investment made on it as elections are near ministers in government dont want it immediately as taxing people would be a setback to them once elections are over congestion tax will be in place
6711301 we dont have any such proposal immediately we will consider it in the days ahead
6711302 this time we got one medal next time we want to get more including golds

6711305 i tried really hard in the third round and gave it my full effort i came to get the gold medal but unfortunately i couldnt do it

6711312 it is always nice to be recognized in this way however our admissions officers always tell prospective students that they should select a college or university that best suits their needs not by its position in a ranking
6711313 we have worked and will continue to work very hard to enhance the academic experience for undergraduate students
6711314 one of the criticisms of the rankings is that they move very slowly it takes a long time for schools to improve
6711315 they may be doing things today that arent going to be reflected for five years in the rankings we wanted to find a way to illuminate some schools that are doing some really interesting thing

6711319 its a full circle the soulful music era of 60s and 70s will be recreated soon in 80s and 90s the industry saw the growth of ghazals and disco dance numbers then came sufi songs so its time for melodious songs again
6711320 i wont comment on music directors like pritam or himmesh reshamiya who are popular but compose music keeping in mind the beats and tunes there are other like shankar mahadeven legendary a r rehman for who melody is still a priority songs of the film taare zameen par shows listeners still want to hear good songs

6711333 right now the challenge for photovoltaics is to make the technology less expensive
6711334 therefore the objective is find new materials and novel device structures for cost effective photovoltaic devices
6711335 the beauty of organic photovoltaics and organic leds is low cost and flexibility
6711336 these devices can be fabricated by inexpensive solution based processing techniques similar to painting or printing
6711337 the ease of production brings costs down while the mechanical flexibility of the materials opens up a wide range of applications
6711338 the research at sdsu is focused on new materials with variable band gaps
6711339 the band gap determines how much solar energy the photovoltaic device can absorb and convert into electricity
6711340 were working on synthesizing novel polymers with variable band gaps including high medium and low band gap varieties to absorb the full spectrum of sunlight by this we can double the light harvesting or absorption
6711341 we are working to develop these new light emitting and efficient charge transporting materials to improve the light emitting efficiency of full color displays

6711350 with more than a quarter of the u s gross national product over 2 trillion sensitive to weather and climate events these events substantially impact our national health safety economy environment transportation systems and military readiness
6711351 all 50 states are impacted by these events and many of these events will be exacerbated by climate change
6711352 our concern is that our nation is not prepared for severe weather or climate change because of declining budgets and lack of attention to these threats over the past few years
6711353 we should improve our ability to respond to severe weather events and prepare for the impacts of climate change that will undoubtedly occur over the next several decades decision makers need information on how climate change will affect their local areas but we are hampered by a lack of funding observations and computing power to provide information at this local level
6711354 making our nation resilient to severe weather and climate change
6711355 given the costs of weather and climate disasters we believe these are wise and critical investments

6711400 peterbilt is at the forefront of developing hybrid technologies that reduce emissions and increase fuel economy
6711401 our new green technologies website spotlights peterbilts technological advances which allow customers to reduce their carbon footprint while increasing their overall fuel efficiency
6711402 in recent months we have learned that driver variability makes more difference in fuel efficiency than biodiesel utilization does
6711403 this new information is exciting because we already know that biodiesel offers a fleet many added benefits beyond fuel efficiency
6711404 biodiesel acts as an engine lubricant biodiesel offers significantly higher cetane numbers reduces harmful emissions and adds national fuel production and biodiesel offers a fleet the opportunity to market itself as a green transporter to todays environmentally conscious corporations
6711405 although both the petroleum and b20 groups experienced some fuel filter plugging in zero degree fahrenheit weather the b20 trucks did not experience any considerable challenges because test partners implemented proper handling and storage measures
6711406 if b20 can work for a fleet in the upper midwest december through february it can run in any fleet across the nation year round
6711407 fleet owners fuel managers and owner operators can be confident about biodiesel utilization in their over the road operation because of the results of the two million mile haul demonstration
6711408 we are receiving positive feedback from customers who see the green benefits of using a trucking company that runs on biodiesel
6711409 by using a renewable fuel decker is actually picking up additional business
6711410 trucks transport virtually 100 percent of groceries medicine clothing appliances and even the fuel thats pumped at the local gas station diesel fuel prices are hurting us and driving up the costs of all of these consumer goods we need a comprehensive energy plan
6711411 petroleums high price is not only straining family budgets at the pump its driving up the price of groceries and basic household goods because truckers are paying three time more for diesel than they did four years ago
6711412 this plan is a comprehensive energy solution that includes domestic drilling and alternative energy research it will resolve the crisis american families are facing

6711447 banks in india need to start thinking through the challenges and develop a roadmap for successful convergence at the earliest the proposed convergence with ifrs is likely to create significant challenges most importantly the initial and ongoing ifrs convergence will affect reported networth available capital and capital adequacy for indian banks
6711448 in addition to the general accounting standards and practices that constitute indian gaap banking companies are currently required to adhere to accounting policies and principles that are prescribed by the reserve bank of india rbi for example financial reporting policies for provision for loan losses and investments are specified by the rbi our experience indicates that adoption of ifrs requires a significant change to such existing policies and could have a material impact on the financial statements of financial companies we also expect that in addition to the financial accounting impact the convergence process is likely to entail several changes to the financial reporting systems including it systems and processes adopted by banks in india

6711546 emerging horticultural hubs like ethiopia and uganda with their sight on the long term benefits are offering special treatment to horticulture industry investors
6711547 we expect to sustain the current level of exports but growth will be at zero not the two to three per cent we realised in the previous years
6711548 the sales figures are going down last year the dutch industry grew by four per cent over 2007 in the first half of this year growth has been flat said mr van ostaijen
6711549 i dont expect there will be room for expansion of kenyan exports

6711567 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier
6711568 fairly new and untested in high volumes outside a lab setting
6711569 were so blessed to have such an example of what hard work and dedication can do
6711570 when she scored the goal we went sprinting around the restaurant screaming
6711571 the first thing she said was thank you for everything
6711572 said galanis who has worked with lloyd for five years
6711573 brazil has better soccer players but the u s has better athletes
6711574 the only way you can lose it is if you let the brazilians beat you and if they do beat you make sure its a fight
6711575 take them to have fun make their lives a little better and try to forget what they went through
6711576 i want to go home the russian troops are here
6711577 i think ill take them to the beach next summer
6711578 this is probably the first step in closure not only for a wounded family but for a community
6711579 i think its long overdue and im glad they finally found whoever did this so that my nephew can finally be resting in peace
6711580 following those discussions we have agreed in principal to consider other alternative sites and ways that we can mutually overcome those obstacles
6711581 we are committed to continuing those discussions while preserving our rights to the south columbus boulevard site
6711582 we told them we have no cash that day when i offered 30 million is gone they probably should have grabbed it
6711583 given the experience that foxwoods already experienced the last thing they want to do is go out of the frying pan into the fire and go to a more horrendous community problem
6711584 i would guess there would be some outside litigation that would crop up from this
6711585 the fact that he saw them was a small miracle really but it makes me sad for the people who didnt get their photos back
6711586 i think its unfair to say that i did anything that wasnt aboveboard
6711587 doctors say im responding well although the treatments will continue the outlook is good im optimistic
6711588 i fully expect to conduct my duties as lieutenant governor the next two years in pennsylvania are going to be exciting as the governor follows through with his agenda on education the environment and the economy i intend to be right there to help him
6711589 the thing that concerns me the most is that its being reported that she is getting radiation and chemotherapy
6711590 when the senate convenes again in september i will be there gavel in hand
6711591 catherine baker knoll is about as energetic a fighter as i know
6711592 and we have high hopes that shell be able to overcome this
6711593 i dont care how poor you are everybody understands the consequences of not eating
6711594 theres no defense to how the outraged comments of district attorney lynne abraham and mayor nutter are tainting the jury pool
6711595 clearly danieal would not be able to be exposed to this had they done their job
6711596 that the mother is charged with murdering her kid is absolutely ridiculous
6711597 this grand jury report says that everybody else abandoned her and lied about it to cover it up and now were going to charge her with murder
6711598 because they were also denied access to medical care if you believe your child had a medical condition the solution is to take them to a physician
6711599 shes stuck with all these children and she realizes she has a problem
6711600 could appreciate the grinding impact of overwhelming poverty but thats the job of a good defense lawyer
6711601 if it were me id be working hard for the best deal possible
6711602 youve got to come out swinging for your client no matter how unpopular the case is
6711603 youve got a firm obligation to your client because frankly often the only person standing up in public for them is their lawyer
6711604 latanya has sufficient clinical and administrative experience necessary to perform supervisory oversight of this unit
6711605 this will be the biggest baddest boldest exhibition ever that tells the story of african americans
6711606 think for a minute there would be no america without the contributions of black folk
6711607 from the arrival of the first slaves in jamestown 400 years ago all the way up to the time of barack obama were going to tell that story
6711608 we want to use temporary exhibitions to explore all aspects of american history and the constitution african americans from the beginning have been central to telling that story
6711609 but this is a bad area we need more police i pray for them to catch the one who killed my nephew
6711610 they immigrants come over here trying to make a better living and they end up going through the same thing we go through
6711611 we need cops not 7 p m to 11 p m like now we need them all day long like it used to be
6711612 people who come here with entrepreneurial goals are very often doing so in neighborhoods that are really living with a challenging level of crime and sometimes they are specifically targeted because people think they dont speak sufficient english or people think they will be easy targets
6711613 the rumor and in some cases the reality that immigrants dont trust banks
6711614 so there is the perception that they will have more cash on hand
6711615 i remember a 17 year old who was the only support for his family being held up several times
6711616 its not a new story but it is a sad story
6711617 i feel almost embarrassed talking about rent concessions when people lost everything
6711618 until this process plays itself out im not placing blame anywhere
6711619 what are they going to do to ensure the welfare of the residents here
6711620 im getting my wedding ring upgraded im getting it hooked up shes going to get hers upgraded too
6711621 i think the big story here today is that there is for the first time an expression by foxwoods to reconsider their current site and they are actively exploring other sites that are not on the waterfront
6711622 we have shared with city and state officials the obstacles that resiting would entail
6711623 following those discussions we have agreed in principle to consider other alternative sites and ways that we can mutually overcome those obstacles we are committed to continuing those discussions while preserving our rights to the south columbus boulevard site
6711624 we anticipated that there would be two different meetings because the issues are different
6711625 a good first step towards achieving the goal of re siting both casinos
6711626 process is important and we dont want to go from one backroom deal to another
6711627 the people of philadelphia should be able to say whether they want casinos and where their preferred location should be not the casinos
6711628 its not time for celebration but its time to be optimistic
6711629 we sampled oyster tissue on tuesday and wednesday and the lab results will provide guidance as to whether or not the suspension will be lifted or needs to stay in place
6711630 the last time we closed the shellfish beds to harvesting for this was in june of 2005 it doesnt happen that frequently
6711631 if mishandling happens somewhere in the chain that can be a problem
6711632 did the wholesalers where the oysters originated handle any other products from another state
6711633 i have enough oysters planted there to last me until this whole thing is sorted out
6711634 we have a great product the oysters have been getting better all the time
6711635 barring any positive samples for bacteria or other problems i think it will be open by next week
6711636 theres no strategic decisions in this district about how to bring everything together
6711637 were causing our own problems by not thinking about things in a systemic way
6711638 for the young people who attend those schools its great
6711639 but could we have a situation where we didnt have to rob peter to pay paul
6711640 criteria to keep some kids out you leave the large comprehensive high schools with a serious lack of resources
6711641 innovation for the sake of innovation is not something im interested in
6711642 i certainly celebrate what paul did but its certainly not going to be good enough for me
6711643 new superintendents have the prerogative to bring whatever changes and best practices to the district they serve i did that im sure shes going to bring her own ideas to try to take the district to the next level and i wish her the very best
6711644 my job is to make sure we level this playing field so all children have equal resources
6711645 youd see many more teachers who are experienced going into more challenging schools
6711646 it is something that we would be willing to talk about
6711647 we may indeed have to go back and make deeper cuts
6711648 its seven seven houses and heres one house americans cant afford john mccain to move into
6711649 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6711650 i guess if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong
6711651 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6711652 a statewide search to find pennsylvanians who like john mccain have so many homes that they just cant keep track of the number
6711653 hello ladies did someone dial back back to 1857 and order james buchanan 15th president of the united states
6711654 order order judge brandeis holds that this party isnt sexy enough
6711655 o k but what am i going to use to cover my face with
6711656 stiffler is everything you wouldnt want in a teenage son promiscuous rude inappropriate and downright lecherous but his mother known in the film only as stifflers mom is no better taking the virginity of one of his most geeky friends
6711657 scientists are pushing ahead with powering up the machine shrugging off speculative fears that it could destroy all life on earth by sucking it into a black hole
6711658 i got a gold medal in the beijing olympics so you
6711659 my ultimately trivial and trite game is superior to your pointless and
6711660 alright class may i have your attention we have a transferred student today and her name is yoshizawa hitomi please be nice to her
6711661 just call me yossie and the thing i hate the most is annoying people so dont bug me or ask any silly questions when its not needed
6711662 didnt i just say not to ask silly question and to answer your question its because i hate skirts
6711663 ok class settle down yossie please take a seat next to ishikawa rika shes sitting next to the window first row fourth seat
6711664 we heard that youre a talented detective and can break any case without a sweat in tokyo theres this ishikawa gang that has been smuggling in illegal cocaine and weapons and they made money through any illegal means
6711665 its easy to say that but we dont have any evidence everytime we sent spies they always end up missing or being killed so we want you to take this case
6711666 well if i say that this case is related to your sisters death
6711667 your sister died in a car accident however a witness saw ishikawa crews in that car so they might be involved with your sisters death
6711668 even though ishikawa kazuko is a dangerous man but he has a daughter named rika and he loves her a lot she goes to an all school girl named gakuhou high school we want you to get close to her and if you have a chance then investigate her father
6711669 ill accept this case but i dont want to wear a skirt
6711670 dont worry about that we can ask a permission for you to wear pants by the way change your name to hitomi to hide your idenity
6711671 so thats rika behind a scary father theres a cute daughter how ironic
6711672 when the network equipment detects a state approaching congestion it identifies the heaviest current users of the system based on their last few minutes of use no historic profiling and then deprioritizes their packets for periods of between 10 and 20 minutes
6711673 comcast the most advanced network in america with truly unlimited internet
6711674 well most people using that bandwidth are sharing something illegal
6711675 hey were not going to back this up but youre using way too much so were stopping your for an undetermined period
6711676 slow speed due to other people on the network is fine
6711677 ti tu te i was just wondering do these factual lists affect whether or not you like these baby names en espa ol
6711678 i like someone and he likes me we are talking im being cautious
6711679 a swedish vaccine against nicotine will be tested on 400 people in three nordic countries
6711680 create a social network in which people could share their life the way they want to and connect with people in a meaningful way
6711681 how they disclose their own information and how they disclose content to people
6711682 weve tried to emulate exactly how people want to present their own personas online we all operate personal and professional sides now with social media and the web were becoming more familiar with having a public side be it a twitter feed or other kinds of services we want to provide you with adequate ability to segment what you would say and show about yourself and do so in a really easy to use way
6711683 with our heritage in enterprise collaborative software we are taking it to a corporate market in the fall
6711684 the idea of categorizing your contacts and having multiple profiles plays well in terms of peoples dual roles of interacting with their colleagues as well as dealing with partners and customers that go outside the firewall people dont want to join multiple social networks so if they can have a single dashboard and identity and achieve these things in a controlled way we think weve got a success on our hands
6711685 when it comes to founders we know we are usually going to see something odd
6711686 in some cases they are exorbitantly paid and in others they are paid miserly
6711687 requested me to cut short my conference overseas in order to quickly return to malaysia to make a statement in ijok to attack anwar ibrahim on the subject of the lottery licence
6711688 i made the trip stated the facts and returned to sabah
6711689 unknown to him dr mahathir at the time in my pocket was my signed resignation letter addressed to the pm also bn chair in case i was instructed to approve the state licence to the gaming company which i would be unable to do as that would be against the interests of the state and people anwar did not pursue the matter anymore
6711690 till this day i am grateful to the state cabinet ministers of 1997 from sabah umno sapp upko pbrs and akar who stood by me as chief minister in overcoming this difficult episode with the central government
6711691 but to the dismay of sabahans in 2001 the bn government issued the licence at both the state and federal levels to the lottery company concerned
6711692 further to add insult to injury slot machines were increased from five per club to ten per club if any umno leader wishes to pursue this matter i can volunteer the facts and sequence of events in more detail
6711693 he anwar wanted the licence because his elder brother was the chairman of the company concerned
6711694 none of us wanted the reference points for the actors or anybody working on this to be other war movies
6711695 we wanted their reference points to be the reality of the war that was fought
6711696 selon mes informations si les russes bougent cest la vitesse dun escargot cest trop peu et beaucoup trop lent

6711699 abbiamo ricevuto una nota dai russi attraverso canali militari con cui informano della decisione di sospendere ogni evento di collaborazione militare internazionale tra mosca e i paesi della nato

6711716 stupids you say you look to the democrats for salvation and if we were as smart as you we would too cool baby and you also tell me that when confronted with the choice between continuing to lie about and cover up the various horrible personal sins you imagine them to have committed and seriously challenging an administration that has engaged in genocide that continues to this day despite the fact that it has been fully in the democrats power for a year and a half to defund the criminal occupation of iraq an administration that has established the full framework required for a dictatorship here at home that has normalized torture as a standard and acceptable means of warfare and that has engaged in innumerable other monstrous acts and destroyed the last vestiges of constitutional government the democrats choose to give in to blackmail and opt for lying and covering up their acts of personal malfeasance in other words the democrats are devoid of even the smallest shred of integrity or courage or decency they are content to see innocent people murdered in the hundreds of thousands and even millions they are content to see innocent people tortured they are content to see this country destroyed completely and permanently
6711717 we suspect that it is too early for central bankers to put their hands up to their share of the blame in the current mess especially whilst it is still in full swing
6711718 but the mood at the symposium is likely to be a more somber one than for some years
6711719 marketing gurus create new terminology like ria and web 2 0 in order to force people to engage in new conversations without them dragging along their baggage of ingrained prejudices about what something is or is not
6711720 they also do it i am convinced to make themselves seem smart
6711721 first because like all things techy its already obsolete and second because its limiting
6711722 i love it because its now such a part of the common vernacular of web culture that when its used everyone immediately understands that you are talking about something better than primitive html websites
6711723 rias are impacting the way that companies like ebay ford random house viacom ge dow jones and nbc think about the internet and desktop software and are demonstrating how innovative thinking can completely change the way they do business
6711724 i ik dacht dat het bi ill was maar toe oen begon hij me ove eral aan te raken en toen
6711725 wat een viezerik eerst met mij zoenen terwijl ik dacht dat het bill was en nu laura bijna bijna
6711726 ik moet er niet aan denken wat er was gebeurd als we er niet op tijd bij waren
6711727 we sprongen meteen bovenop m en probeerden hem tegen te houden om weg te glippen maar hij was te sterk en ontsnapte rosalie is m nog achterna gerend maar hij was veel te sterk
6711728 een ding weten we nu wel we moeten de jongens vertellen over de dubbelganger want hij kan zo voor een hoop misverstanden zorgen
6711729 eehh niks mijn moeder weer vraagt ze of ik mijn medicijnen wel neem en of of ik het wel een beetje rustig aan doe echt soms word ik zo gek van haar
6711730 im not saying bad liverpool teams ever won the league of course they didnt but maybe a few years ago you could afford to carry a few players
6711731 i dont think thats possible now every position has got to be filled by a top player if you want to win things on a consistent basis
6711732 the fact that the manager hasnt bought in loads of new players shows he has faith in the squad it hasnt changed much at all from last season
6711733 the year before last we finished with 68 points and last year we got 83 which represents a big step up we can all learn from the mistakes we made last year and hopefully go one step better this time
6711734 we need to put fire in anelka tell him look anelka you are very good maybe this will be the season for anelka
6711735 i need to work more on his head on his thinking in the field because he has good quality
6711736 we speak about it quite often neither of us started well and we used to say we wanted to leave
6711737 we can laugh about it now because we have both reached 100 games
6711738 tottenham fans are no exception to any others they support the team and get behind the side

6711786 its going to be a tough game there is no question about that and im sure the boys are going to put their bodies on the line
6711787 this is going to be a massive challenge for us theyve got a very good side frank farina has slowly moulded a very competitive side and we are going to have to be smart in how we play but i certainly feel we can negate their strengths and hopefully we get a couple of chances to put some goals away
6711788 he copped a couple of corkys on the weekend and he got quite a severe one just above his knee it has improved but not as much as we would have liked
6711789 he got pretty battered by the perth defence and theyre all pretty big boys so the way he has been playing his football for the last 15 years it has been like that so hes going to cop the bruises and unfortunately for him and the team hes come up a bit short this week so well just rest him and he should be right for selection next week
6711790 let me get this straight i think fabio capello is a great coach he has been at the top of his game for years and ive no doubts he will get us to the world cup finals i certainly dont want to fall out with him
6711791 ernest vandiver joe frank harris and zell miller stand out as three of the greatest champions of education in modern georgia history

6711793 governors vandiver harris and miller all recognized ugas role in providing educational leadership for georgia and they worked to ensure that the university received state resources and assistance to carry out this mission

6711797 its unlikely that a broadcast network is ever again going to create a megahit like the cosby show which at its mid 80s peak drew as many as 50 million viewers an episode for several years now tvs top event has been foxs american idol last season it drew 28 8 million viewers a week
6711798 in many ways the networks themselves already have specific brand identities they just dont admit it for decades cbs has had the most elderly demographic among the major networks abc specializes in comedies and light dramas with strong female appeal fox with the exception of american idol is largely aimed at guys the fledgling cw is building on gossip girl and americas next top model to chase young women nbcs struggles are not unrelated to the fact that its still trying to be all things to all people
6711799 the average household has its tv on for eight hours and 14 minutes daily thats a record
6711800 i knew much about bolton because one of my favourite players was okocha
6711801 when the manager came over to visit me in amsterdam i already had a very good feeling about it i always watched bolton because of okocha who is the best dribbler ever
6711802 maybe at times i am a bit too honest and at club level the manager is telling me not to defend too much to try and save some energy for when we are attacking

6711812 we managed to progress in the dfb pokal and we didnt lose the opener
6711813 there is absolutely no logical explanation as to why we so often play below our capabilities here
6711814 that was a game thats easy to sum up there was absolutely nothing new here we just cant seem to get our game going when were here
6711815 we have only ourselves to blame for dropping the points we took the lead played quite well and then conceded a really horrible and stupid goal those kinds of mistakes just cant be allowed to happen whether youre in the flow of things are not
6711816 im happy to have scored the winning goal against napoli especially because people have been mocking me for not having scored in pre season yet
6711817 now i hope that i can keep the goals flowing its always a pleasure to play alongside pippo inzaghi because i can watch the way he plays and take things from his repertoire

6711826 this is of course tragic news about the loss of such a giant in the music business stax records was in many ways the house that isaac built as a prolific songwriter and performer and i cant think of a more fitting way to show our gratitude for everything he gave us than to fill the l a coliseum with all of his fans

6711936 the golf products industry has become a bit of an arms race with the differences becoming narrower and narrower
6711937 the recognition is that callaway has something different its always about the liberation of players
6711938 there are similarities in terms of how their cultures and products have been driven by a singular perspective of the founding individuals steve jobs and ely callaway the same cant be said for callaways competitors so our assessment of them was that we dont have to invent an emotional brand for them just bring it into the mix
6711939 their whole way of bringing products to market will step up and we are one ingredient of a big change at callaway
6711940 you will see something dramatic and our work will be one of many new things

6711953 if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6711954 i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6711955 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6711956 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6711957 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues

6711968 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6711969 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6711970 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6711971 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
6711972 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6711973 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
6711974 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
6711975 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
6711976 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6711977 the chinese government and the chinese athletes must be respected
6711978 if you trust every web site but not a government
6711979 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official it is possible that all news on the internet is accurate
6711980 for the time being there is nothing i can add
6711981 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6711982 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
6711983 so we have sent a letter to the ioc and to the international federation asking them to review the matter and see if they cant resolve it for the good of the competition the integrity of the competition and the good of all the athletes
6711984 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6711985 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6711986 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition
6711987 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
6711988 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6711989 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6711990 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6711991 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6711992 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6711993 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6711994 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6711995 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6711996 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6711997 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6711998 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6711999 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6712000 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6712001 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6712002 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6712003 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6712004 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6712005 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6712006 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6712007 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6712008 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6712009 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans

6712012 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6712013 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6712014 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

6712018 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6712019 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6712020 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo

6712026 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6712027 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6712028 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia

6712039 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6712040 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6712041 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6712042 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6712043 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6712044 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6712045 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6712046 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6712047 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6712048 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6712049 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6712050 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6712051 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6712052 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6712053 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6712054 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6712055 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6712056 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6712057 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6712058 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6712059 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6712060 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6712061 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6712062 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6712063 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6712064 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6712065 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6712066 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6712067 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6712068 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6712069 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6712070 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6712071 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6712072 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6712073 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche

6712077 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
6712078 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6712079 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
6712080 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
6712081 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
6712082 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6712083 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6712084 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6712085 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6712086 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6712087 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6712088 y vio a la carroza y a una bruja espantacional
6712089 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6712090 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6712091 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6712092 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

6712098 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6712099 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6712100 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6712101 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6712102 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6712103 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

6712111 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6712112 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6712113 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6712114 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6712115 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6712116 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6712117 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6712118 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6712119 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6712120 he aint talked to me hes talkin to ollie and i aint gonna sit up til 2 waiting on his ass we can talk tomorrow
6712121 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6712122 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6712123 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6712124 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6712125 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6712126 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6712127 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6712128 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6712129 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6712130 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6712131 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6712132 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6712133 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6712134 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6712135 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6712136 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6712137 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6712138 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6712139 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6712140 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
6712141 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6712142 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6712143 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6712144 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6712145 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6712146 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6712147 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior

6712150 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6712151 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6712152 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6712153 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6712154 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6712155 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6712156 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales

6712163 we really wanted to mirror the authentic food experienced in regional mediterranean towns and villages where local produce is provided fresh on a daily basis and immediately used in traditional menus often following family recipes as a result the food is distinctive giving guests a tastier made to order and homemade farm to fork dining experience
6712164 there are several key aspects to mediterranean cooking and each one has been tackled with equal passion
6712165 the effort was time consuming but certainly worth it for example we even source our own wheat and wholegrain flour for the bakery baking all our own bread every day using fresh eggs and quality butter preparing food from scratch makes a huge difference our bread is now so popular that we bake extra so that local residents can come and collect their bread at counter culture our deli style restaurant on the ground level
6712166 with this new technology we can offer more patients a better prognosis sparing them surgery and a months long recovery period which all huge benefits especially if youre in your 80s or 90s

6712175 a nasal polyp its when your nasal lining becomes overgrown
6712176 but why would my nose be inflamed because of a cold
6712177 a number of things can cause the inflammation asthma an allergy to aspirin cystic fibrosis
6712178 calm down it doesnt mean youve got cystic fibrosis polyps are quite harmless they happen to be common in people who have cystic fibrosis thats all
6712179 im not allergic to aspirin as far as i know and dont have asthma
6712180 as i said ill run some tests to check you for asthma just in case
6712181 theyre four times more common in men than in women and most sufferers are over forty
6712182 im going to prescribe a weeks worth of nasal drops see if that reduces the size of them
6712183 theres no up side to being adversarial in these kind of deals youve just got to stay positive and youve got to focus on whos here and have trust and faith in the people that are working on getting everything done

6712186 tottenham fans are no exception to any others they support the team and get behind the side
6712187 if a player is on form if he knocks in a couple of goals then im sure anyone who booed him last week will soon be getting behind him and cheering him that is what it is like
6712188 while he is still here he is very much 100 per cent a tottenham player that is how we consider things
6712189 it is not a case of finding a solution to a problem before it occurs

6712245 worley died aug 12 1968 in bo ban hamlet quang nam province vietnam in a valiant act of heroism he instantly threw himself upon the grenade nearest him and his comrades absorbing with his body the full and tremendous force of the explosion
6712246 i was doing a study of bravery when i came across ken
6712247 the idea of the study was to have examples of actions that people take that are brave
6712248 there was so little public information and i wanted more than their citations i wanted personal background
6712249 i found worley field and wondered if it was named after him
6712250 theres nothing named after him in farmington which is really unfortunate most medal of honor recipients have highways or buildings named in honor of them but there was no public dedication made in honor of him
6712251 all i want is for that kid who spent 16 years of his life here to be honored
6712252 my heart went out to worley i hope that after all of this comes out this kid will be recognized as somebody really important
6712253 i dont feel i can do it until i find out more information and if hes got strong ties or roots to the community
6712254 i can remember that first day when practice started we were just leaving town
6712255 it was coincidence nothing else but i talked to several of last years coaches that got jobs they either called me or i called them and then i kind of felt the pang
6712256 id been doing this for 47 years ive been on the field at this time of year hollering at somebody as an assistant or head coach yeah its something to get over but when your driving to montana or flying to california your thoughts go to something else
6712257 both carol jo and i have been focused on a lot of other things
6712258 i didnt intend it to be that way because i didnt know what would happen after thanksgiving then april came along and bang bang bang you have a little thing here and there
6712259 i see something on television or see a clip in the paper so you do have pangs of anxiety sometimes i get up early and work out about 6 i used to head to the practice field or office at 6 a m and now i go to the workout gym but with each passing day and being involved with other areas im adjusting
6712260 you miss the memories the players and coaches you miss the friendships and relationships the best part of my job is when you bring a young guy in as a 17 or 18 year old bright eyed to watch him after four years be a whole different person is rewarding itll be interesting to see how i feel on saturdays and fridays because i was getting on the airplane a lot for the past 30 or so years
6712261 i do not miss when you get home at 3 in the morning from a saturday game and you go in at 8 oclock in the morning and work all day sunday until about 10 oclock at night
6712262 i wonder how that will work because ive never had that opportunity matt my oldest boy is coaching at arizona state im hoping we can get down to arizona state for at least two or three games this season
6712263 well try to follow marc as best we can but it will be hard to attend a game im not happy with the administration the way it all happened at the end without even a thank you well watch marc and support all the coaches because i know most of them but as far as me going to any games you go and you are more of a distraction
6712264 they gave me a nice office here in fort collins in one of the branches i go in there and answer some phone calls and do a little public relations ill attend some golf tournaments and i have some speaking engagements
6712265 ill go and spend a half day in each of the branches and say hello to the customers sign a miniature football for them or something like that
6712266 i think i get dumber in my old age here a lot of restaurants are closing and were opening one up i dont know if thats smart or not im involved in it and have a share of it
6712267 we have 20 plus investors i figured if each one of us goes down and eats there once a month we can make it go that way i have no expertise in that but my job will be about the same ill go down shake some hands meet people and theyll have some memorabilia from colorado state as well and stanford and the university of miami

6712275 we were not aware of the child kidnap allegations until last year asq conducted an audit of indian children who were adopted into queensland between 1995 and 2007
6712276 the adoption of the queensland child who was allegedly stolen was authorised by the madras high court in march 2000 she said
6712277 i am aware of allegations regarding child trafficking and share concerns for the safety of children adopted from overseas mr mcclelland said

6712318 this is a practical manifestation of the all ireland agenda a novel way in which young nationally minded people can promote their irishness and highlight the folly of partition the young people involved in these actions are simply providing a public service and should be applauded for saving an post a job of work when we achieve irish unity

6712323 spending behind the united states presidential election and around the beijing olympic games should continue to boost 2008 revenues
6712324 levels of activity in 2008 should match those seen in 2007 and there are significant new business opportunities
6712325 the prospects for 2009 remain less certain particularly if the united states and western european economies continue to be impacted by the financial crisis and commodity price increases
6712326 in addition the new united states president will have to wrestle with twin fiscal and budget deficits in early 2009 and post the olympics chinese growth may slow due to inflationary particularly food price concerns and the impact that a weakening united states economy has on the rest of the world
6712327 position the group very well to weather any economic slowdown
6712328 i was obviously personally pretty disappointed but its not about myself its about the team
6712329 i was hoping to get the nod but it wasnt meant to be i can only do what ive been doing throughout pre season working as hard as i can and force my way in

6712332 cloud computing is one of those catch all buzz words that tries to encompass a variety of aspects ranging from deployment load balancing provisioning business model and architecture like web2
6712333 i view cloud computing as a broad array of web based services aimed at allowing users to obtain a wide range of functional capabilities on a pay as you go basis that previously required tremendous hardware software investments and professional skills to acquire cloud computing is the realization of the earlier ideals of utility computing without the technical complexities or complicated deployment worries
6712334 i think clouds are the next hype term for the next year or two people are coming to grips with virtualization and how it reshapes it creates service and software based models and in many ways changes a lot of the physical layer we are used to clouds will be the next transformation over the next several years building off of the software models that virtualization enabled

6712344 they blamed everything on the jewish conspiracy they hated western culture it was like living with jihad on a daily basis
6712345 im incredibly concerned that we did make an award to leeds community school over nine years ago and any allegation that any funding weve given to any project has been misused and not used to change the lives of disadvantaged children and young people makes me concerned and very sad
6712346 i can reassure the british public that we are very careful in who we fund and this allegation is a very rare one for us but one that causes a great deal of concern
6712347 the grants made by bbc children in need to leeds community school itself a charity registered with the charity commission were given in good faith in 1998 and 1999
6712348 no evidence has been produced that the money they received was used for terrorist activity
6712349 bbc children in need does everything it possibly can to make sure that the public money is entirely used to benefit these children
6712350 positively change the lives of disadvantaged children and young people in the uk
6712351 working with children who may have experienced mental physical or sensory disabilities behavioral or psychological disorders are living in poverty or situations of deprivation or suffering through distress abuse or neglect
6712352 the size and scale of the bbc children in need appeal means that were able to give grants to hundreds of different organizations some of which are very small and dont have the resources to fund raise for themselves
6712353 the bbc deceived its audience by faking winners of competitions and deliberately conducting competitions unfairly

6712359 the apes are jews the people of the sabbath while the swine are christians the infidels of the communion of jesus
6712360 fighting infidels until they either convert to islam or submit to muslims as dhimmis is still considered by islamists to be a religious duty
6712361 the militants believe that controlling one country will rally the muslim masses enabling them to overthrow all moderate governments in the region and establish a radical islamic empire that spans from spain to indonesia
6712362 iraq would serve as the base of a new islamic caliphate to extend throughout the middle east and which would threaten

6712365 death is better than living on this earth with the unbelievers among us
6712366 there will be continuing enmity until everyone believes in allah we will not meet the enemy halfway and there will be no room for dialogue with them
6712367 islam does not coincide or make a truce with unbelief but rather confronts it the confrontation that islam calls for with these godless and apostate regimes does not know socratic debates platonic ideals nor aristotelian diplomacy but it knows the dialogue of bullets the ideals of assassination bombing and destruction and the diplomacy of the cannon and machine gun

6712371 loud and disturbing snoring at least three nights a week
6712372 the predisposition for adult snoring may be partly established early in life
6712373 having had severe airway infections or recurrent otitis ear infection in childhood being exposed to a dog as a newborn and growing up in a large family are environmental factors associated with snoring in adulthood
6712374 we hypothesise that infections in childhood and exposure to airborne endotoxins in infancy stimulate the lymphatic system with subsequent enlargement of the tonsils
6712375 people who snore run an increased risk of early death and cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks or strokes

6712388 the good news is its consistent the higher your vitamin d status the lower the risk of your developing a hip fracture
6712389 we conclude that low serum vitamin d concentrations are associated with an increased risk for hip fracture in community dwelling women the mechanism of association is unclear
6712390 if you dont have adequate vitamin d you cannot efficiently absorb calcium
6712391 vitamin d also helps maintain bone health by keeping bone cells active
6712392 to get vitamin d levels to where they need to be to reduce the risk of hip fracture you need to be taking at least 1 000 international units of vitamin d a day from a supplement
6712393 they need to ask their doctor for the right test
6712394 women should strive to keep your vitamin d levels above 125 nanomoles per liter year round to do that they are going to require supplements

6712397 i am delighted to see that knowsley students are surpassing all expectations once again these students worked extremely hard to achieve this success often overcoming significant barriers to learning it makes me feel very proud as yet again more of our young people will be progressing into further education training and employment
6712398 driving up attainment levels has been a major focus for knowsley and this years grades are proof that the initiatives in place are really working in partnership with all our secondary schools programmes such as firm foundations have helped contribute to this years successful results
6712399 but the real stars are the students for their hard work and commitment knowsley will continue to build upon these improvements to ensure future success for all learners this years success will provide a springboard for the effective transition from our current schools to the seven new state of the art centres for learning that will start to open between 2009 and 2010

6712491 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6712492 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6712493 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6712494 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6712495 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6712496 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6712497 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6712498 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6712499 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6712500 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6712501 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6712502 oh then go to the consulate there you dont have to come to berlin
6712503 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6712504 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6712505 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6712506 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6712507 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6712508 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6712509 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6712510 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6712511 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6712512 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6712513 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6712514 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6712515 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6712516 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6712517 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6712518 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6712519 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6712520 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6712521 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6712522 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6712523 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6712524 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6712525 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6712526 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6712527 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6712528 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6712529 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6712530 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6712531 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6712532 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6712533 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6712534 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6712535 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6712536 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6712537 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6712538 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6712539 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6712540 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6712541 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6712542 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6712543 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6712544 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6712545 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6712546 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6712547 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6712548 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6712549 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6712550 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6712551 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6712552 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6712553 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6712554 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6712555 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6712556 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6712557 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6712558 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6712559 this is a planning took where all things are going
6712560 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6712561 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6712562 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6712563 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6712564 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6712565 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6712566 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6712567 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6712568 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6712569 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6712570 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6712571 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6712572 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6712573 documentary in which newly married presenter alex riley finds out what it takes to climb on to the property ladder alex has a dream of buying a home for himself his wife and possible future children but as he embarks on a jaw dropping journey he discovers nearly a million properties lying empty and soon realises that britains property ladder is more than just broken
6712574 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6712575 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6712576 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6712577 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6712578 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6712579 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6712580 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6712581 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6712582 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6712583 and as for those who can fast with difficulty e g i an old man they have a choice either to fast or to i feed a miskin poor person for everyday but i whoever does well of his own accord it is better for i hi 1 and that you fast is better for you if only you t know
6712584 the month of ramadan is that in which was revealed the quran as guidance for the people and clear proofs of guidance and criterion so everyone of you who is present at his home during that month should spend it in fasting
6712585 o you who believed decreed upon you is fasting as it was decreed upon those before you that you may become righteous
6712586 islam is based on five pillars testifying that there is no deity worthy of worship but allah and that muhammad s is the messenger of allah swt performing these prayers paying the zakat making the pilgrimage to the house and fasting in ramadan
6712587 all the deeds of adams sons people are for them except saum fasting which is for me and i will give reward for it observing saum is a shield or protection from the hell fire and from committing sins if one of you is observing fasting he should avoid sexual relation with his wife and quarrelling and if somebody should fight or quarrel with him he should say i am observing saum by him in whose hands my soul is the smell coming out from the mouth of a fasting person is better before allah swt than the smell of musk there are two pleasures for the person observing saum one at the time of iftar breaking fast one at the time when he will meet his lord then he will be pleased because of his saum
6712588 when the month of ramadan starts the gates of the heaven are opened the gates of hell are closed and devils are chained
6712589 there is a gate in paradise called ar rayyan and only those who observed saum fast will enter through it on the day of resurrection and no one except them will enter through it
6712590 fasting and quran will intercede for a slave on the day of resurrection
6712591 o allah i have stopped him from eating and desire intercede him through me
6712592 i have stopped him from sleeping in the night intercede himfn throuah me he said then they will intercede for him
6712593 whoever fasts ramadan out of faith and with the hope of reward all his previous sins will be forgiven
6712594 whoever observes saum fast in the month of ramadan with sincere faith and hoping for a reward from allah then all his previous sins will be forgiven
6712595 verily allah swt forgives not that partners should be set up with him in worship but he forgives except that anything else to whom he pleases
6712596 so shun the abomination worshipping of idols and shun lying speech false statements hunafa lillah i e to worship none but allah swt not associating partners in worship etc unto him and whoever assigns partners to allah swt it is as if he had fallen from the sky and the birds had snatched him or the wind had thrown him to a far off place
6712597 worship allah swt you have no other iiah god but him lailaha ill allah none has the right to be worshipped but allah
6712598 and when my slaves ask you o muhammad concerning me then answer them i am indeed near to them by my knowledge
6712599 mankind were one community and allah swt sent prophets with glad tidings and warnings and with them he sent the scripture in truth to judge between people in matters wherein they differed
6712600 messengers as bearers of good news as well as of warning
6712601 so remind them o muhammad saw you are only one who reminds you are not a dictator over them
6712602 quran 14 10 then allah swt refuted that claim by saying
6712603 had allah swt willed he surely could have sent down angles
6712604 say if there were on the earth angel walking about in peace and security we should certainly have sent down for them from the heaven an angle as a messenger
6712605 and he it is originates the creation then will repeat it after it has been perished and this is easier for him
6712606 did you think that we had created you in play without any purpose and that you would not be brought back to us
6712607 and we created not the heaven and the earth and all that is between them without purpose that is the consideration of those who disbelieve then woe to those who disbelieve in islamic monotheism from the fire shall we treat those who believe in the oneness of allah swt islamic monotheism and do righteous good deeds as mufsidun those who associate partners in worship with allah swt and commit crimes on earth or shall we treat the muttaqun the pious ones as the fujjar criminals disbelievers wicked etc
6712608 so that their hearts and minds may thus learn wisdom and their ears may thus learn to hear for indeed it is not the eyes that grow blind but the hearts which are within the bosoms that grow blind

6712619 mf247 that stops at the end of august is recruited by the yahoo auction
6712620 we issued a release saying that over 40 olympic athletes downloaded the album in an act of solidarity and thats what triggered it then everything got blocked
6712621 we are aware of the logon problems but we have no comment at the moment
6712622 it seems like suspending itunes is punishment for itunes but really it doesnt hurt itunes it hurts us
6712623 some in beijing did download and i think thats what spooked the
6712624 theyre incredibly supportive people they wouldnt do anything like that
6712625 we are protesting against the presence of an aggressive russian fleet on ukrainian land
6712626 oh yeah its a marketing gimmick i read about it in runners world several years ago some marketing genius decided to take mens products and pink it and shrink it to boost sales
6712627 we appeal to people to march to eidgah ground to remember and pay homage to martyrs
6712628 and to protest indian occupation and pray for kashmirs secession
6712629 the information i have is that if theyre leaving it is at a snails pace
6712630 replace the individual memeberships by different eu states with a standing eu army
6712631 we never expected these results people should get what they pay for
6712632 we really like sushi and wed take home fish samples and put them in alcohol
6712633 replace the individual memeberships by different eu states with a standing eu army
6712634 mehr als die h lfte aller sterreicherinnen und sterreicher lebt im l ndlichen raum ohne funktionierende infrastruktur den zugang zu neuen kommunikationstechnologien und die gerechte verteilung der finanzmittel sind eine geringere wirtschaftliche leistungskraft dieser regionen und eine weitere abwanderung die folge offensive strategien zur st rkung des lebens und wirtschaftsraumes l ndlicher raum sind daher notwendig
6712635 die von darabos angek ndigten einsparungen ber 400 mio euro haben sich laut rh bericht nicht nur auf 267 millionen euro reduziert sondern diesem deals stehen auch noch verluste bei den gegengesch ften in der h he von 500 mio euro gegen ber der minister hat somit ganz klar die unwahrheit gesagt
6712636 f r diese eigenm chtige st ckzahlreduzierung musste sogar das operativ taktische konzept nachtr glich ge ndert werden die schlimmsten bef rchtungen die wir von anfang an ge u ert hatten sind also eingetreten dieser minister ist nicht nur f r das sterreichische bundesheer sondern f r die gesamte republik ein gro er schaden und mu daher sofort den hut nehmen
6712637 die ifes studie best tigt es der schl ssel zur zufriedenheit der sterreichischen b rgerinnen und b rger mit der eu ist das subjektive informiertheitsgef hl unverst ndliche informationen machen die menschen zu recht skeptisch die studie zeigt wie wenig sich die sterreicherinnen und sterreicher von der arbeit des eu parlaments informiert f hlen
6712638 aus diesem grund haben wir seitens des bundeskanzleramts eine breite informationskampagne geplant um einen entscheidenden beitrag zu leisten eu angelegenheiten klarer und verst ndlicher darzustellen unser ziel ist es br ssel vor die haust ren und in die schulen in den regionen zu bringen nach der ablehnung im ministerrat will ich einen neuen anlauf unternehmen das paket doch noch gemeinsam umzusetzen die aktuellen zahlen sind daf r das beste argument
6712639 wir wollen ber alle aspekte der mitgliedschaft positive wie auch negative ausf hrlich informieren
6712640 unter http www bka gv at site 6033 default aspx k nnen sich interessierte zum beispiel dar ber informieren wie eu f rderungen vor ort eingesetzt werden und wie sich diese mittel auswirken selbstverst ndlich kann man ber diese seite auch mit uns direkt kontakt aufnehmen
6712641 leider entpuppt sich die gro e ank ndigung als kleiner wurf
6712642 die regelung dass eine irref hrende preispolitik unterbunden werden soll ist laut entwurf bis 31 dezember 2008 begrenzt die gestern ge u erten bedenken des clubs haben sich sehr schnell best tigt
6712643 zum beispiel ist unklar wie viele preis nderungen das wort h ufig beinhaltet das im papier als definition verwendet wird
6712644 damit konnten wir auch unseren marktanteil in sterreich im gegensatz zu vielen mitbewerbern und trotz der widrigen bedingungen weiter ausbauen
6712645 jetzt ist offiziell erkennbar warum darabos das parlament nicht nur hingehalten und schlecht behandelt hat der bericht best tigt dass der minister dem parlament und damit auch der ffentlichkeit die unwahrheit gesagt hat
6712646 all das hat darabos im alleingang und unter umgehung des auch gesetzlich vorgeschriebenen prozederes ausverhandelt dilettantisch tollpatschig ohne kaufm nnisches talent zum schaden der republik der steuerzahler der sicherheit und der wirtschaft
6712647 nun beweist sich dass die von minister darabos angewandte monatelange verz gerungstaktik dazu diente seine unverantwortliche vorgangsweise m glichst lange zu verbergen immerhin hatte der landesverteidigungsausschuss des nationalrates am 29 mai des jahres mit breiter mehrheit nur die sp war dagegen den minister in einem antrag aufgefordert den rechnungshof rohbericht zum eurofighter vergleich im wege von erhebungen vorzulegen das hat darabos schlicht verweigert und die ihm vorgegebene frist nicht eingehalten nun wissen wir warum
6712648 der name omnia der im lateinischen f r alles und im arabischen f r wunsch steht wurde nicht willk rlich gew hlt das samsung omnia ist micro notebook navigationsger t digitalkamera taschenkino und nicht zuletzt mobiltelefon in einem ger t das sich mittels touchscreen bedienen und personalisieren l sst alles in allem ein unverzichtbarer begleiter
6712649 die sp und verteidigungsminister darabos die bev lkerung und das parlament hinters licht f hren wollten
6712650 darabos hat das wirtschaftliche kunstst ck zusammengebracht gebrauchte flieger teurer als neue zu kaufen
6712651 mit seinem vergleich der als rettungsanker gedacht war ex sp chef gusenbauer wenigstens in die rufweite eines gehaltenen wahlversprechens zu bringen wirtschaftlicher schaden entsteht
6712652 dadurch wichtige gegengesch fte im ausma von 500 millionen euro verloren gehen und damit arbeitspl tze auf dem spiel stehen aber das war der sp ja schon egal als sie in kauf genommen hat dass in zeltweg wo die eurofighter stationiert sind mehr als 1 400 arbeitspl tze verloren gehen als sie vehement gegen die eurofighter eingetreten ist
6712653 sein unprofessionelles vorgehen im besonderem bei der formulierung von bestimmungen im vertrag bringen die republik in eine unangenehme situation bei diesem kauf geht es um milliarden und darabos findet es nicht der m he wert die vertr ge detailliert und klar zu formulieren stattdessen bekommen wir bereits gebrauchte flieger teurer als neue und von zusatzausstattungen wie urspr nglich ausverhandelt ist jetzt nichts mehr zu h ren
6712654 so wie darabos das angegangen ist und einen milliarden deal geschlossen hat w rden die sterreicherinnen und sterreicher nicht einmal ein auto kaufen
6712655 was soll man von einem minister erwarten dem die unlust mit der er das amt f hrt f rmlich ins gesicht geschrieben ist
6712656 was sterreich braucht ist kompetente politik die ziele verfolgt und auch erreicht und nicht linke tr umer die ihre ideologie verwirklich sehen wollen
6712657 der eurofighter flop der sp ist nun der h hepunkt der gebrochenen wahlversprechen es ist verantwortungslos wie die sp mit wahlversprechen und w hlerstimmen umgeht und die bev lkerung von a bis z t uscht und hinters licht f hren m chte es ist damit einmal mehr bewiesen dass sich an diesem verhaltensmuster auch unter faymann nichts ndern wird und den menschen nur das blaue vom himmel versprochen und in wirklichkeit nichts davon eingehalten wird
6712658 und dann ist das helenental an wochenenden nur noch mit dem auto erreichbar oder m ssen jetzt alle den neuen radweg und das wegerl im helental ben tzen wenn sie das auto nicht verwenden wollen oder keines haben
6712659 ein argument das immer wieder angef hrt wird um verbindungen einzustellen der biosph renpark wienerwald ist erholungsraum f r viele menschen ich erwarte mir statt einer linieneinstellung eine attraktive angebotserweiterung z b auch tolle kombi tickets und au erdem sind gerade jugendliche auf die busse angewiesen und haben das recht auf mobilit t
6712660 wo bleiben die sensiblen sozialen und kologischen k pfe die die frequenz mit guten angeboten steigern die landesregierung sollte sich sch men gelder f r ffis im biosp hrenpark wienerwald zu k rzen
6712661 wir waren so souver n und sind so vorneweg geprescht das war ja der hammer
6712662 auf den letzten metern wusste ich dass uns das keiner mehr nehmen kann
6712663 das h tte mehr sein k nnen das rennen ist nicht optimal gelaufen
6712664 ich werde noch ein zwei n chte dar ber schlafen aber auf der gro en b hne war es das letzte rennen
6712665 nat rlich w rde man lieber mit einer medaille abtreten
6712666 unverantwortliche verz gerungen im bereich eines innovativen leistungsorientierten dienstrechts bringen die universit ten in die zunehmend kritische situation kein attraktiver arbeitsplatz f r wissenschafterinnen mehr zu sein wenn hier im bereich des dienstrechtes und des kollektivvertrags nicht raschest gehandelt wird werden wir eine generation junger wissenschafterinnen verlieren
6712667 dass ein immer noch restriktives fremdenrecht forschung und wissenschaft behindert und der internationalen reputation sterreichs schadet
6712668 es ist sinnvoll und notwendig hier gegen ber der anwendungsorientierten forschung etwas aufzuschlie en und balance zu wahren
6712669 schule und universit ten in einem ministerium zu betreuen wird die unis zum f nftem rad am wagen werden lassen auch die trennung der universit ten von der forschung welche in einem innovations und technologieministerium beheimatet sein soll w re wohl fatal und w rde die universit ten zu reinen ausbildungsfabriken reduzieren
6712670 sie war 4m2 gro und hatte keine heizung im winter habe ich mit haube und handschuhen gelernt
6712671 da habe ich erst gemerkt wie wenig das universit re wissen mit der praxis zu tun hat
6712672 start des seniorenbund wahlkampf konvois und pr sentation des wahlkampfprogramms des seniorenbundes
6712673 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6712674 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6712675 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6712676 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
6712677 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6712678 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
6712679 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
6712680 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
6712681 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6712682 contingency arrangements are in place to ensure that the mca will continue to provide an emergency service the industrial action is by those responsible for co ordinating rescues the rescuers themselves will continue to operate as normal the agency is very aware that this weekend will be busier than normal and are therefore reminding the public to take extra care whilst on the sea beach or cliffs the mca is urging the boating public to think carefully about their plans and to make sure they are aware of standard safety advice before considering going afloat this weekend boat users are strongly reminded that a suitable up to date marine weather forecast should be obtained before putting to sea skippers should make sure that everyone on board has lifejacket and is wearing it a fixed or handheld radio should be taken mobile phone coverage at sea is far too unpredictable suitable in date flares should be carried warm clothing should be stowed in the event of a lengthy breakdown a torch and spare batteries are absolutely essential they can be used to guide a rescue helicopter or lifeboat towards you an on shore contact should be identified and a passage plan worked out in advance to ensure no one is left worrying about potential late arrivals the following services remain unaffected helicopters will continue to fly rnli lifeboats and lifeguards are available as usual mca volunteer coastguard rescue officers are ready in their local communities as usual when out at sea other ships and craft will assist others in distress our emergency tugs and pollution control experts will respond to any shipping incidents that threaten the environment
6712683 acum 3g ul e inteles in cea mai mare parte drept video telefonie nu ca nu ar fi asa dar departe gandul de dezvoltare a 3g pentru asa ceva aceasta idee predomina in randul consumatorilor obisnuiti nu se aplica insa si oamenilor de afaceri cred insa ca iphone se va vinde in principal catre consumatorul de rand indiferent de pretul la care va sosi pe piata
6712684 avem aceste cozi false in fata a 20 de magazine din tara pentru a creste interesul pentru iphone
6712685 s a vorbit destul de mult si despre probleme pe care le a avut pana acum iphone s a vorbit deoarece este un element interesant in evolutia tehnologiei si telefoniei atat timp cat producatorul rezolva problemele aparute pe moment clientului eu ca simplu consumator de tehnologie sunt multumit important este sa nu am timpi morti foarte mari si in acelasi timp important sa vad din partea producatorului implicare daca el e receptiv la probleme este normal ca un produs nou aflat la prima versiune sa vina si cu ceva probleme care au scapat echipelor de testare urmatoarele versiuni ar trebui sa fie mai stabile si sa elimine bug urile si cu siguranta asa va fi
6712686 das umsichtige und dauerhafte qualit tsmanagement des unternehmens stellt sicher dass die umsetzung des programms
6712687 ich bin mit der intensit t des trainings sehr zufrieden die kinder hatten spa und waren gewillt jeden tag etwas zu leisten auf das gezeigte kann man aufbauen
6712688 mit dieser einigung haben wir den entscheidenden schritt gemacht damit die
6712689 almost everyone knows that something is terribly wrong but the socialist looks at state run capitalism mistakes it for the free market and believes free marketeers are part of the they who are winning and free marketeers think the socialists with their desires for more regulations and welfare are on the side thats winning on a similar note gay activists and the religious right see each other as a threat to civilization the right sees open immigration mulitculturalism and islam as threats to our culture and believe the left is on the side thats winning because theyve taken over the educational system the left thinks the right is winning because of corporate greed and an expanding police state it seems to me however that over the past seven years we have had more of just about everything
6712690 to find so many polar bears at sea at one time is extremely worrisome because it could be an indication that as the sea ice on which they live and hunt continues to melt many more bears may be out there facing similar risk
6712691 as climate change continues to dramatically disrupt the arctic polar bears and their cubs are being forced to swim longer distances to find food and habitat
6712692 while these bears are swimming around in an ice free coastal arctic ocean the only thing the state of alaska is doing is suing the federal government trying to overturn the listing of polar bears
6712693 while athletes from all over the world are vying to break world records in beijing the students at cheikh anta diop university are trying to break the record in stone throwing
6712694 it was jungle green the ugliest thing youd ever seen
6712695 i chromed everything i could chrome and added a golden phoenix to the body people in town thought i was crazy
6712696 china has been poor and invaded for hundreds of years finally it came up to be a great nation again and it has the ability to hold the olympic games
6712697 i made the front of the great wall steps to welcome people to beijing
6712698 because the walls not supposed to be a barrier anymore

6712703 ich hoffe dass wir in misano ein besseres wochenende hinlegen k nnen

6712705 vergangenes jahr war die strecke auch ziemlich holprig das war wohl ihre schlechteste eigenschaft in sachen setup ist es in misano am wichtigsten gute bremsen und eine gute stabilit t zu haben wenn man aus den kurven heraus beschleunigt es ist die art von strecken wo man sehr aggressiv fahren kann

6712887 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about male underwear
6712888 the reality is that barack obamas and the democrats fixation on the clothing choices of john mccain show he and they are completely out of touch with the concerns of average americans
6712889 somebody asked john mccain how many pairs of underwear do you have and he said im not sure ill have to get back to you true quote im not sure ill have to get back to you so they asked his staff and he said at least 20 at least 20
6712890 if youre like me and youve got only 2 pair of shorts or you were like the millions of men who are struggling right now to keep what few pairs of shorts they own clean you might have a different perspective by the way the answer is john mccain has 44 clean pairs of underwear so theres just a fundamental gap of understanding between john mccains world and what people are going through every single day here in america

6712910 siegen zwei kinder bei feuer in wohnung ums leben gekommen
6712911 it is my decision i have thought about it and have decided to rule them out
6712912 when i spoke with leo he was very upset he doesnt take tolerate breaking the rules
6712913 after wednesdays game three players checked out of the teams opera hotel and then moved to the grand hotel even though it was forbidden to do so
6712914 i dont think they can be called up for the games against slovenia and san marino they could end up with a financial penalty
6712915 boruc dudka and majewski took part in a heavy drinking session with journalists
6712916 our disciplinary committee will discuss the case further but it appears they will not play against san marino or slovenia
6712917 i was informed that wigan want to sign me on loan but they are yet to contact middlesbrough
6712918 wigan coach steve bruce admires my abilities he has tried to sign me when he was in charge of birmingham and now he has renewed his interest
6712919 i will take my final decision next week after meeting middlesbrough coach gareth southgate
6712920 southgate told me that he wants to keep me at the riverside i will talk with him to settle on the best choice
6712921 i seek regular first team football both clubs can offer me equal chances to play on a regular basis both of them have very good strikers also
6712922 but im sure i can force my way into the starting xi of any team once i regain full fitness
6712923 i may opt to stay at middlesbrough for the sake of stability i settled in there after spending a whole season with them
6712924 anyway i wont close the door on a move to wigan i may end up joining them if they offered me more first team football
6712925 you never say never but it would take an astronomical sum of money to get wilson
6712926 when you see some of the fees being quoted at the moment such as 18 million for gareth barry just because he plays for a more fashionable club then that sets the level
6712927 wilson is still young and there is a lot of improvement in him but i dont fear him leaving for the time being
6712928 the best thing about it is that every game you have to go out and win
6712929 they are all cup finals and at least you have something to play for i was used to being with cork city and shels going for leagues its a different ball game here
6712930 im looking forward to it we are all up for it and its going to be a tough battle for the four teams that are down there
6712931 we are playing well even though we got beaten 3 0 by bohs and 3 0 by derry at half time in both thise games it was 0 0 and we were playing well
6712932 i have been proposed 1 2 million per year this makes you want to start a fresh challenge
6712933 but i never said i didnt want to stay at rennes if they give me the wages i want theres no problem
6712934 this kind of offer from everton cant be refused everton are a springboard it can permit me settle in the english championship and then why not joining another great club in the future
6712935 why not staying another year then its a question of money my priority is rennes reaching an agreement with everton who propose me a very big deal
6712936 if rennes give me what i want i dont see why i would join another club
6712937 i spoke about the premier league with bruno cheyrou john mensah and john utaka they just tell me to think i have a family to feed in cameroon the financial aspect is primordial we spoke about it as well
6712938 elas merecem nosso respeito pela conquista da prata s o hero nas pois enfrentaram uma equipe muito forte como a dos estados unidos e tiveram uma grande atua o eu conhe o o futebol americano sei o trabalho que eles fazem por l desde o col gio
6712939 obviously the england managers going to be coming down to watch the side a lot
6712940 if ive got aspirations to get back into that squad im playing my football at the right place
6712941 i had a lot of speculation last season with people saying i was performing well at boro and that i perhaps deserved a chance then
6712942 my answer then was the same as now ive come to a new club and first and foremost i want to settle to get into the starting xi week in and week out
6712943 then i can go from there and get some consistency if someone gives me a call id be happy to go
6712944 it was a perfect hat trick in the end header left foot and right foot

6712959 we feel they are both excellent additions to our hockey staff
6712960 jeff brings vast experience from the professional level and has also been involved in various roles at the tier ii and minor hockey levels over the past several seasons
6712961 no money would be taken from academics there would be no taxpayer money it would be all private
6712962 its a unique format thats never been done before in the united states
6712963 finding revenue sources from technology has not been widely done but it is definitely on the horizon and something we want to try to take advantage of
6712964 we then thought abut the power of putting all these into one financing package and bundling all the marketing and premium seating assets into one strong sales and marketing approach
6712965 were all going to have to find ways to win a little bit
6712966 we have to keep it in perspective and make sure it makes financial sense for everybody the img people told us they would keep us whole the lexington center whole and they want to do well themselves
6712967 if they think they can successfully construct three new facilities without public dollars involved we have an obligation to explore this proposal
6712968 parking is one reason its a good piece of real estate near the main arteries near the other athletic facilities soccer and football
6712969 were talking about total overall upgrades with everything at commonwelath stadium
6712970 what sponsors really want is relationships with the school the student body and their consumers naming rights is not always the best way to do that
6712971 its not like will you pay 50 000 for a suite but do they want a suite where they can entertain how big what amenities what do they want it to look like
6712972 this is the direction in which new sports venues are moving
6712973 were not going to have a consortium of 10 banks to deal with we are going to have a private equity partner yet with the same amount of financial leverage weve had in the past with more traditional forms of financing
6712974 we would be a limited partner for a limited time
6712975 is knowing it is going to be built right the right kind of premium services that exactly meet the specs to which people have told us they want and we believe we can sell

6712978 we need a senator who is going to start addressing the issues now republican christine odonnell charged in a telephone interview that was followed by a news conference in dover
6712979 hes using the people of delaware and this senate career as a fallback to his aspirations to another career the situation is too critical for that
6712980 in this election i should be debating my real competition for this job odonnell said
6712981 and the people of delaware should get the opportunity to cast a vote for the person who is going to fulfill their term hes taken delawareans for granted and using the senate as a placeholder
6712982 whether people agree with my positions or not they should be outraged she said
6712983 this is precisely why our country and our state is in the situation it is
6712984 to put it plainly t boone pickens is out to save america
6712985 he asked if we could we join together and do something i told him no because global warming is on page two for me

6712990 call last week for americans to break their addiction to oil
6712991 economic problems that will make this years financial turbulence look like a trip to the debt counselors office
6712992 there arent too many authors of note who have passed through l a in the last three decades whom connie hasnt interviewed and interviewed well
6712993 this inherently transdisciplinary archive will provide material for research projects for generations of scholars and students
6712994 digitizing these tapes will give students and others an opportunity to hear and watch these outstanding authors for themselves whenever they want
6712995 seeing authors up close like this provides a rich point of view to their work
6712996 drucker believed that a healthy society is run by organizations whose values are shaped by a wide range of disciplines history sociology psychology culture and religion
6712997 in fact drucker once described management books as dreadful trash and suggested that he derived much of his philosophy from novelists such as austen balzac and others
6712998 is a beautiful setting for the tapes to call home
6712999 this is about shifting the power back to the people
6713000 mccain cant keep track and referred inquiring reporters to his staff
6713001 where is the comment i was just notified about i dont see it bummer
6713002 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6713003 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6713004 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6713005 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6713006 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6713007 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6713008 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
6713009 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
6713010 this is a small project that probably a very few of you know about
6713011 ok before some of you start groaning this is an outside funded project that is keeping a few developers employed but it is really more than that it is an interesting and fun project
6713012 for a lot of people who have health insurance they are paying more for health care but it may not show up as concretely as paying 70 to fill their gas tank
6713013 college costs health care costs and energy costs are up and income is down
6713014 any one of those subjects touches a raw nerve for the middle class in this country im seeing it in race after race
6713015 the issue of health care may be getting less attention than it deserves from the media but its still a top concern for voters and among the top issues that sen obama talks about on the campaign trail
6713016 there is a stark contrast in the way both candidates would address the issue because the views on providing affordability accessibility and portability of health care are so divergent it could hardly escape the conversation each candidate will have with voters
6713017 if people had to pass that many signs that announced how much health care costs you can bet it would be at the top of the agenda
6713018 it is strikingly different from 2000 when gore spent 60 percent of the time at most events talking about health care
6713019 my electrical meter should be standing still or going backwards
6713020 the system will offset their electrical bill by about 80 percent
6713021 it will stabilize their bill and shield them from the unknown of future edison rate increases
6713022 it will offset 537 000 miles driven by the average car
6713023 thats about eliminating 21 500 miles driven per year its like taking 1 7 cars off the road for 25 years and planting 2 8 acres of trees
6713024 every single one of those quotations came from the campaign of 1960 when the republicans attacked john fitzgerald kennedy
6713025 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6713026 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6713027 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6713028 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
6713029 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6713030 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6713031 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6713032 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him
6713033 the most inexperienced ticket in the history of the world
6713034 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6713035 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6713036 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6713037 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
6713038 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
6713039 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
6713040 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
6713041 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
6713042 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
6713043 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
6713044 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
6713045 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6713046 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6713047 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6713048 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6713049 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6713050 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6713051 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6713052 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
6713053 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
6713054 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6713055 at least i dont cake on the makeup like a trollop you c t
6713056 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6713057 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6713058 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6713059 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6713060 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6713061 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6713062 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6713063 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6713064 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6713065 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
6713066 thats nothing a coat of paint will do the job
6713067 you cant call yourselves the doors because you cant have the doors without jim morrison
6713068 while the three partners had agreed to the commercial morrison vehemently disagreed and the commercial was not done
6713069 morrison had been adamant against doing commercials and densmore wanted to honor morrisons memory
6713070 if we use their tactics well lose the moral high ground
6713071 the fundamental basis of this nations laws was given to moses on the mount the fundamental basis of our bill of rights comes from the teachings we get from exodus and st matthew from isaiah and st paul
6713072 i dont think we emphasize that enough these days if we dont have a proper fundamental moral background we will finally end up with a totalitarian government which does not believe in rights for anybody except the state
6713073 a general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor
6713074 to resign on the day of the service for walter lippmann
6713075 he seemed perfectly decent and reasonable during the negotiations it has been a disquieting experience for me it has really made me lose my faith in my judgment of people
6713076 peretz used to look like a jewish psychoanalyst now he looks like a jewish used car salesman page 783
6713077 when i first heard that he was after the new republic i wrote gil saying that if he ever got hold of it he would destroy it
6713078 trust me i have the inside dope that obvious thing that everyone already knows is true
6713079 i cant believe i actually miss jonah goldberg in tnr
6713080 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
6713081 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
6713082 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
6713083 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
6713084 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6713085 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6713086 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6713087 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6713088 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6713089 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6713090 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6713091 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6713092 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6713093 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6713094 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6713095 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6713096 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6713097 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6713098 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6713099 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6713100 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6713101 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6713102 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6713103 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
6713104 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6713105 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6713106 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6713107 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6713108 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6713109 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6713110 jerusalem must remain the capital of israel and must remain undivided
6713111 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
6713112 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
6713113 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
6713114 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
6713115 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
6713116 fc porto tentou mas tinha dado a palavra ao rui costa
6713117 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6713118 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6713119 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6713120 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
6713121 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
6713122 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
6713123 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
6713124 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6713125 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
6713126 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6713127 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6713128 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6713129 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6713130 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6713131 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6713132 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
6713133 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
6713134 they told me there are going to be resources here
6713135 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
6713136 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
6713137 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
6713138 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
6713139 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
6713140 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
6713141 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
6713142 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
6713143 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
6713144 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
6713145 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
6713146 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
6713147 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
6713148 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
6713149 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
6713150 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
6713151 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
6713152 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
6713153 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
6713154 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6713155 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6713156 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
6713157 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6713158 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6713159 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
6713160 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
6713161 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
6713162 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
6713163 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet

6713168 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6713169 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6713170 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6713171 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6713172 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
6713173 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6713174 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6713175 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
6713176 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful

6713184 we believe ecosystems that reuse common services deliver more faster and cheap innovation than any single vendor
6713185 the industry has changed more in the past five years than in the previous two decades
6713186 and we dont see the pace of innovation slowing anytime soon as we approach this next wave businesses will be challenged to adapt faster to changes in their competitive landscape in order to serve their customers ever changing needs the companies that have invested properly in it infrastructure will have the ability to handle the market changes the companies that invest in enterprise services architecture will accelerate ahead of competitors
6713187 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6713188 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6713189 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
6713190 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
6713191 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday

6713195 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
6713196 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
6713197 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests

6713200 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
6713201 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes

6713227 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
6713228 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells

6713230 we know that here in south carolina we have a disparity in health care
6713231 we have to bring in communities that will be more affected make them part of the decision making
6713232 why do you need us to join the climate debate are you saying because i am black i am not involved already or that you need more useful victims for your cause agenda
6713233 it becomes evident that while discussing climate we are not witnessing a clash of views about the environment but a clash of views about human freedom
6713234 as someone who lived under communism for most of my life i feel obliged to say that the biggest threat to freedom democracy the market economy and prosperity at the beginning of the 21st century is not communism or its various softer variants
6713235 why do so many people who subscribe to the belief in global warming also subscribe to the leftist liberal viewpoint on so many matters why does this belief appeal to those that have a certain political view
6713236 what does a cane toad and salt water intrusion have to do with global warming see you liberals just flip and spin flip and spin obama is an expert at it
6713237 it didnt take us long to figure out what this
6713238 if the lawyers will take the case sue the people who sell carbon credits that includes al gore that lawsuit would get so much publicity so much media attention and as the experts went to the witness stand and testified i feel like that could become the vehicle to finally put some light on the fraud of global warming
6713239 also i dont think that the republicans have handled the war on terror very well either
6713240 none of the studies cited above has shown clear evidence that we can attribute the observed climate changes to increases in greenhouse gases
6713241 no study to date has positively attributed all or part of the climate change to man made causes
6713242 how can you be so self centered how can you seriously type this nonsense

6713261 were not going to turn on a switch one day and suddenly our audience gets 100 times bigger
6713262 its really our plan within the closed beta to get a very high number of peak concurrent users and we expect in the later phases of the closed beta to be about as big as bad company is today in terms of online numbers
6713263 were going to have a very large closed beta almost to the point where every hardcore gamer in the world will probably be able to get a key if they want to it would just be within a closed beta so that we can control the size of it to a degree
6713264 you may have seen that there was an announcement that the game was delayed john riccitiello mentioned that in the recent earnings call actually were in the closed beta already so the game is already out and you cant delay a game thats already been released and already been played by people
6713265 its an interesting difference between a packaged goods product like our previous battlefield games in that there is no real kind of big splash release date where suddenly its available it kind of builds up over time the game will kind of sneak out and before you know it it will be a fairly big game even though were in the closed beta and were not released
6713266 its an interesting thing for the consumers the press and the industry to learn is that this type of game doesnt do the big splash and the time when it monetises isnt really necessarily the time when people start to experience it

6713295 if ive got aspirations to get back into that squad im playing my football at the right place
6713296 i had a lot of speculation last season with people saying i was performing well at boro and that i perhaps deserved a chance then
6713297 my answer then was the same as now ive come to a new club and first and foremost i want to settle to get into the starting xi week in and week out
6713298 then i can go from there and get some consistency if someone gives me a call id be happy to go
6713299 it was a perfect hat trick in the end header left foot and right foot
6713300 ive seen in training he can be devastating at times with the pace and power hes got he just sparks into life
6713301 first week back it takes a bit of time to get back into the swing of things and i did make a few mistakes out there
6713302 i wouldnt want to make them the next three days and hopefully i dont make them the next three days
6713303 i thought i played nicely but middle of the round i missed a number of really good birdie chances and then took four twice and two sixes
6713304 looking back at it you have to say i didnt feel like i did much wrong but some of thats that mental tiredness
6713305 i have been proposed 1 2 million per year this makes you want to start a fresh challenge
6713306 but i never said i didnt want to stay at rennes if they give me the wages i want theres no problem
6713307 this kind of offer from everton cant be refused everton are a springboard it can permit me settle in the english championship and then why not joining another great club in the future
6713308 why not staying another year then its a question of money my priority is rennes reaching an agreement with everton who propose me a very big deal
6713309 if rennes give me what i want i dont see why i would join another club
6713310 i spoke about the premier league with bruno cheyrou john mensah and john utaka they just tell me to think i have a family to feed in cameroon the financial aspect is primordial we spoke about it as well
6713311 the best thing about it is that every game you have to go out and win
6713312 they are all cup finals and at least you have something to play for i was used to being with cork city and shels going for leagues its a different ball game here
6713313 im looking forward to it we are all up for it and its going to be a tough battle for the four teams that are down there
6713314 we are playing well even though we got beaten 3 0 by bohs and 3 0 by derry at half time in both thise games it was 0 0 and we were playing well
6713315 it is my decision i have thought about it and have decided to rule them out
6713316 when i spoke with leo he was very upset he doesnt take tolerate breaking the rules
6713317 after wednesdays game three players checked out of the teams opera hotel and then moved to the grand hotel even though it was forbidden to do so
6713318 i dont think they can be called up for the games against slovenia and san marino they could end up with a financial penalty
6713319 boruc dudka and majewski took part in a heavy drinking session with journalists
6713320 our disciplinary committee will discuss the case further but it appears they will not play against san marino or slovenia
6713321 i was informed that wigan want to sign me on loan but they are yet to contact middlesbrough
6713322 wigan coach steve bruce admires my abilities he has tried to sign me when he was in charge of birmingham and now he has renewed his interest
6713323 i will take my final decision next week after meeting middlesbrough coach gareth southgate
6713324 southgate told me that he wants to keep me at the riverside i will talk with him to settle on the best choice
6713325 i seek regular first team football both clubs can offer me equal chances to play on a regular basis both of them have very good strikers also
6713326 but im sure i can force my way into the starting xi of any team once i regain full fitness
6713327 i may opt to stay at middlesbrough for the sake of stability i settled in there after spending a whole season with them
6713328 anyway i wont close the door on a move to wigan i may end up joining them if they offered me more first team football
6713329 you never say never but it would take an astronomical sum of money to get wilson
6713330 when you see some of the fees being quoted at the moment such as 18 million for gareth barry just because he plays for a more fashionable club then that sets the level
6713331 wilson is still young and there is a lot of improvement in him but i dont fear him leaving for the time being
6713332 weve all got a kind of love hate relationship with the university of washington

6713336 beloved let us love one another for love is from god and everyone who loves is born of god and knows god the one who does not love does not know god for god is love god sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him beloved if god so loved us we also ought to love on another there is no fear in love but perfect love casts out fear because fear involves punishment and the one who fears is not perfected in love we love because he first loved us if someone says i love god but hates his brother he is a liar for the one who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love god whom he has not seen

6713339 i was surprised when i heard about the meeting of the council
6713340 the draft itself is not finalised and such a meeting should take place at the invitation of the president or the prime minister which has not happened certainly there will be no meeting today
6713341 the weak position of the federal budget became the main reason of the black august in 1998 in the summer of 1998 the finance ministry could fund only a half of its spending with the help of taxes the other half was funded at the expense of borrowings when markets stopped lending money to the ministry the federal budget was unable to function properly
6713342 i was very surprised to hear yesterdays statement from finance minister kudrin who did not say a word about the budgetary policy and the weakness of russia s budget during the period of the crisis moreover i was surprised to hear mr kudrin laying the blame for the crisis on the imf if the minister said what he really thouhgt then it means that our government had not learned any lesson from the events that happened ten years ago
6713343 it was the price which russia paid for moving forward

6713379 last week was the perfect start you cant ask for anything more than a win
6713380 i was obviously personally pretty disappointed but its not about myself its about the team

6713413 they are fighting and dying while at home they are talking about slashing and cutting
6713414 for more than a century ichthyologists have thought that pacific and atlantic goliath grouper were the same species and the argument was settled before the widespread use of genetic techniques the genetic data were the key to our finding two species one on each side of the isthmus
6713415 even if urban areas were expanded by 10 this could be achieved by using less than 1 of the total land mass
6713416 that would still leave 89 of the country untouched by development
6713417 what id say is that theyre much more aggressive this fighting season than theyve been in the past
6713418 microsoft has enlisted american comedian jerry seinfeld to be the face of a new 300m publicity campaign
6713419 obviously the england managers going to be coming down to watch the side a lot
6713420 if ive got aspirations to get back into that squad im playing my football at the right place
6713421 i had a lot of speculation last season with people saying i was performing well at boro and that i perhaps deserved a chance then
6713422 my answer then was the same as now ive come to a new club and first and foremost i want to settle to get into the starting xi week in and week out
6713423 then i can go from there and get some consistency if someone gives me a call id be happy to go
6713424 it was a perfect hat trick in the end header left foot and right foot
6713425 ive seen in training he can be devastating at times with the pace and power hes got he just sparks into life
6713426 the best thing about it is that every game you have to go out and win
6713427 they are all cup finals and at least you have something to play for i was used to being with cork city and shels going for leagues its a different ball game here
6713428 im looking forward to it we are all up for it and its going to be a tough battle for the four teams that are down there
6713429 we are playing well even though we got beaten 3 0 by bohs and 3 0 by derry at half time in both thise games it was 0 0 and we were playing well
6713430 i was informed that wigan want to sign me on loan but they are yet to contact middlesbrough
6713431 wigan coach steve bruce admires my abilities he has tried to sign me when he was in charge of birmingham and now he has renewed his interest
6713432 i will take my final decision next week after meeting middlesbrough coach gareth southgate
6713433 southgate told me that he wants to keep me at the riverside i will talk with him to settle on the best choice
6713434 i seek regular first team football both clubs can offer me equal chances to play on a regular basis both of them have very good strikers also
6713435 but im sure i can force my way into the starting xi of any team once i regain full fitness
6713436 i may opt to stay at middlesbrough for the sake of stability i settled in there after spending a whole season with them
6713437 anyway i wont close the door on a move to wigan i may end up joining them if they offered me more first team football
6713438 you never say never but it would take an astronomical sum of money to get wilson
6713439 when you see some of the fees being quoted at the moment such as 18 million for gareth barry just because he plays for a more fashionable club then that sets the level
6713440 wilson is still young and there is a lot of improvement in him but i dont fear him leaving for the time being
6713441 it is my decision i have thought about it and have decided to rule them out
6713442 when i spoke with leo he was very upset he doesnt take tolerate breaking the rules
6713443 after wednesdays game three players checked out of the teams opera hotel and then moved to the grand hotel even though it was forbidden to do so
6713444 i dont think they can be called up for the games against slovenia and san marino they could end up with a financial penalty
6713445 boruc dudka and majewski took part in a heavy drinking session with journalists
6713446 our disciplinary committee will discuss the case further but it appears they will not play against san marino or slovenia
6713447 our fields have been ruined and the houses are submerged we do not know where to go and what to do
6713448 entire paddy fields are under water and everything has been destroyed even are houses are in a bad state
6713449 the research raises the perception both of how common these events are and specifically where they may occur
6713450 today with so many more buildings and people a magnitude 5 centered below the city would be extremely attention getting
6713451 wed see billions in damage with some brick buildings falling people would probably be killed
6713452 we expect to use the robotic arm heavily over the next several weeks delivering samples to our instruments and examining trench floors and walls to continue to search for evidence of lateral and vertical variations in soil and ice structures
6713453 sperm whales go to where their food source is and that means very deep water so folks that do see them are marine mammal observers who ride the seismic survey vessels and the workers on the big oil and gas rigs and even that does not happen often
6713454 the bottom line is that air gun noise from seismic surveys that are thousands of yards distant does not drive away sperm whales living in the gulf
6713455 though p chidambaram is the right person to ask any question but i feel they must get complete money
6713456 the condition of the village is pitiable nobody neither the prime minister nor anyone has ever come or may come here even our mla hasnt come here once they come here to obtain votes they never return to see the condition of the village the collector hasnt turned up here we are facing lots of problems even our animals have to swim to reach the other side many of our livestock have died because of it we are facing problems and stuck in a big dilemma after independence nobody has come here we want to be provided with proper convenience facilities
6713457 our village is covered by pond from all the sides we are living in the middle of water and our life is totally dependent on boats boat is our life animals have to swim to cross the river to reach the other side if our kids and elderly people get ill we are unable to take them to the hospital and they die here we went to everybody from tehsildar to the collector mp and even chief minister some people went to datia district also but nobody was there to listen to our sufferings not a single officer has come here we use the ponds water to drink
6713458 there is 102 years old pond in nowai village it was dried up for past 4 years it was empty the incessant rains have filled it with water there is another alternative way for the villagers we are checking the condition of the village the villagers have been provided with all the facilities everything is fine there they villagers use boats for their convenience
6713459 the impact of climate change on human and global security could extend far beyond the limited scope the world has seen thus far
6713460 water supplies stored in glaciers and snow cover in major mountain ranges such as the andes and himalayas also are expected to decrease
6713461 most critical for human survival are water and food which are sensitive to changing climatic conditions
6713462 environmental changes caused by global warming will not only affect human living conditions but may also generate larger societal effects by threatening the infrastructures of society or by inducing social responses that aggravate the problem
6713463 the associated socio economic and political stress can undermine the functioning of communities the effectiveness of institutions and the stability of societal structures these degraded conditions could contribute to civil strife and worse armed conflict
6713464 large areas of africa are suffering from scarcity of food and fresh water resources making them more vulnerable to conflict
6713465 other regions of the world including the middle east central asia and south america also are being affected
6713466 fit out is a far more volatile marketplace we have built up a set of relationships with blue chip clients in the retail and financial sectors but we have also now adapted a strategy of looking at local customers and local clients in glasgow edinburgh and the liverpool and manchester catchment areas
6713467 this ad is meant for three crores 30 million people of jharkhand and i congratulate dhoni for this because he has reiterated his right of being son of jharkhand we look forward for the approval for jharkhand from ministry of health government of india
6713468 our model suggests that there is a second cell of air in each hemisphere which is characterised by air rising clouds forming storms developing and other processes associated with moisture in the air occurring in the mid latitudes
6713469 i think our study sheds new light on the driving forces behind the weather in the mid latitudes
6713470 complex m amp e fit out to vigorous clean standards
6713471 what is good about thee awards is that they represent repeat business from satisfied clients
6713472 we found two suspected bags when we raided the area after searching the bags we found 70 skulls and 19 bones we dont know whether these bones are human or not we have arrested the hotel lady and she is in police custody
6713473 how can this trait be made in one gender and not the other
6713474 males and females basically have the same set of genes so how do you specifically modify the activity of a males genes but not a females genes
6713475 the flies did not need new genes to make a new pattern
6713476 they just changed how males and females use a common set of genes
6713477 the switch existed for tens of millions of years because it had a different job but it got remodeled
6713478 with this particular trait it evolved by exploiting genetic information that was already there to make male bodies different from female bodies
6713479 if female tastes change these traits go away there is no reinforcement
6713480 there are still many white people in south africa who do not support bafana bafana they also do not really care that the soccer world cup will take place in south africa
6713481 i think they want her personal help because they think she has the secret
6713482 she has a private plane and she came from nothing if shes lifted herself up from the horrible background she came from shes got the key when she gives advice its sort of like doling out some of that
6713483 oprahs like the popular girl in high school who knows how to emotionally blackmail us
6713484 the way shell deliver advice is this will make you happy unless you dont have enough self esteem to do it
6713485 be good to everyone else but be good to yourself first
6713486 find your passion but make sure youre wearing pants that make your butt look small when you do it
6713487 youre perfect just the way you are heres how to lose ten pounds eating smoked salmon and cereal three times a day
6713488 you need to walk a couple laps around this giant conference auditorium to prove your worthiness of being able to attend whatevers inside in the next 20 minutes
6713489 so you were only like 9 when planet terror came out
6713490 we have made a solid start with strong improvement in customer service over the past four months but we are on a three to five year journey to profit recovery
6713491 we have a lot to do and will have to deliver it in increasingly difficult economic circumstances

6713496 so much of what i read throughout the year is heavy
6713497 in the summer you want to read something that makes you laugh
6713498 a good summer read very clearly written and easily digestible as opposed to heavy or thought provoking
6713499 my mom just finished water for elephants im reading it when im done youre going to get it
6713500 last summer the big communal read was elizabeth gilberts eat pray love
6713501 the pledge means a lot because the high performance you get out of these athletes is all pure and hard work
6713502 its blood sweat and tears theres nothing unnatural about it and thats why so many people are drawn to this sport and appreciate the pro league for what it is
6713503 it just hit on a personal level i learned so much about it it was emotional for me it was awesome and that word needs to be spread out especially for female athletes
6713504 not only are these entities trying to educate the youth but theyre also educating professional players like myself
6713505 were pioneering this league for the generations after us and to see that we could be instrumental in delivering a message as far as playing clean its an opportunity
6713506 the majority of our fans are kids and their parents
6713507 if we can make ourselves unique in doing that and pledge to be clean i think its going to really help build our fan base and build our reputation as a league
6713508 alles was wir mit dem flugzeug getan haben stand im einklang mit den regeln und normen

6713513 the parents who are over the top youre never going to change
6713514 its about the incessant pressure on the rest of us its very hard to have the inner fortitude to resist that pressure
6713515 this generation really does feel a commitment to the ultimate emotional outcome of their kids
6713516 fifty years ago parents were content to provide food shelter and education today much more is expected of you
6713517 were very nervous we want our kids to do ok in this new world we want to prepare them as we should
6713518 but we tend to go over the top we cant do anything in moderation were either supersize me or on a diet
6713519 its happening here like its happening at a lot of selective schools in this country
6713520 if you read the popular press you read that all this over scheduling will lead to admission at the school of your choice
6713521 if you are part of the great middle underneath that bell shaped curve not the 1 or 2 percenters the world class musician the world class dancer the world class athlete but everybody else it really doesnt matter if youre scheduled to the gills thats not going to overcome a mediocre transcript
6713522 if a kid would spend as much time on algebra ii as prepping for the sat that kid would be an a student in algebra instead of a b student
6713523 just because you were second team all district in soccer terrific for you but thats not going to get you into a selective college
6713524 if you read the popular press youd believe it is so difficult to get into college but the vast majority of schools are admitting well over 70 percent of their applicant pool
6713525 they all have 4 0 gpas all have fabulous test scores all have taken six ap courses their junior and senior years thats when the r sum starts taking on greater importance
6713526 the ones that are gifted talented and academically sharp tend to have a glorious time

6713528 i was talking with a lawyer friend recently and he was grumbling that the younger lawyers he sees are much more aggressive and competitive and they dont need to be
6713529 when you have a childhood that instead of going out into the fields and playing by the stream and poking into things and reading books is a pressure cooker from the time you enter preschool you grow up in aggressive mode while that will help you get ahead its going to do a number on personal relationships
6713530 what you need to ask is are they supplanting the things we should be doing as a family
6713531 to have the energy and good humor that parents need to nurture their children they must have a life too
6713532 the greatest skill and the hardest to develop is the self confidence that youre the best parent your kids are going to have in the end youre the one who has to make the decisions and take the responsibility
6713533 parenting is a higher calling than being a cruise ship activities director
6713534 if you can pay attention as a parent and help them discern an interest or two then do what you can to nurture that
6713535 i have the privilege of serving on panels with representatives from ivy league schools

6713539 it is clear that even as farm income remains strong rapid increases in input costs are slowing the growth in farm equipment sales
6713540 it seems that other than necessary living expenses delaying the purchase of equipment sale of grain or the purchase of other items is the choice of the day
6713541 the general consensus is that we should have the best overall crop production in 30 years we received rain when it was needed
6713542 however we may see improvement in this index in the months ahead

6713547 prescription sleeping pills can be important in certain situations but they can cause a lot of adverse effects for older people sleep medication can increase the risk of falling as well as interfering with other medicines
6713548 sleeping pills are also not the best way to solve underlying problems like depression or painful conditions that are interfering with a good nights sleep

6713550 but many do not realise that alcohol is one of the major causes of a bad nights sleep about 20 percent of adults in industrial countries have problems sleeping at one time or another the institute analysed scientific studies that cover a wide range of research on sleep and insomnia

6713576 i just kept a good rhythm and i felt really good
6713577 you never know when you get to the starting line because everyone seems like theyre a good runner
6713578 i looked back a few times but there wasnt anybody close
6713579 i felt good today it was a personal record for me by about 50 seconds
6713580 so i felt really good there were a lot of good runners out there
6713581 the closest i ever got to alliette was probably about 100 yards
6713582 he took the lead from the get go and that was it he pretty much maintained
6713583 i wanted to get out as hard as i could i wanted to get out of the first mile at 5 50 and i think i got below that
6713584 i ve been in and out of puddles all day
6713585 i ve been in and out of puddles all day

6713598 keegan pafford and gallagher hogan are two backs who were in the upper echelon in our division last year we have some depth at qb and we have some skill people
6713599 our biggest question mark is how this offensive line is going to develop frankly im optimistic we have some good linemen i just dont know how much depth we have there
6713600 yeah but you still have souhegan you still have milford and goffstown is dropping down from division ii
6713601 plymouth leaving is both good and bad because you aspire to be the best we had two good games with them two years ago you beat a team like that and it feels pretty sweet

6713607 we didnt know who she was she went to my father after and said i didnt have a lot of friends in high school but mike always said hello to me he could make you smile laugh and he could turn your day around

6713691 speaking exclusively to setantasports com qpr star daniel parejo has described the championship side as a new chelsea
6713692 lots of people are saying this club resemble chelsea and i believe the situation looks like what happened there
6713693 they are one of the best teams in the world and hopefully qpr can be a new chelsea
6713694 playing for the best team in the world which is real madrid is every players aim but you never know where you are going to end up
6713695 if i cant make it there i would be delighted to succeed in the premier league
6713696 my personal objective is to become a better player a better person as its an
6713697 i love english football they live it in another way the fans are great and the stadiums are full even if its second division games
6713698 i have an option to stay for another year if the club go up and if madrid want me stay but if not im going to return to madrid setanta parejo interview part 1 parejo i can be the new torres
6713699 i think theyre one of the better teams in the league and i thought they came out well and put us under a lot of pressure early it took us about 20 minutes to get settled
6713700 the effort for 90 minutes was good the organization of the team was improved but certainly not good enough were missing a few players at the attacking end of the field to help make us a little bit better and that was pretty obvious
6713701 we lost the ball in a bad spot on the field and did not react well as a group give thorrington credit it was a very good finish
6713702 my preference would be to have carlos here as well as eddie lewis some moves had to be made we talked to a number of teams not only on carlos but some other players but in order to to be able to sign eddie lewis who is a player i think this teams needs and will help us make better we had to make a roster move and there were certain financial implications involved with it the other part of that equation is you need to look at that as not only a short term move but a move that allows you more flexibility in the off season as you try to improve this roster
6713703 hell need some tests to make sure there arent any issues so we need to wait and see
6713704 we want to take the right precautions to make sure theyre arent any issues you cant tell by touching feeling i think hes got to have a scan
6713705 hes a great coach if you look at his record everywhere hes went hes made a team better when given time hes done some amazing things so i expect him to succeed greatly i have the utmost respect for him as a coach as a person and i wish him the best
6713706 some goals are saveable yes he said that some arent i felt i did everything i could on that one i saw it fine and everything its disappointing to give up a goal that started with a bad pass in midfield and a guy comes 30 yards down the field and finishes it and nobody steps to him
6713707 i had some time away from the game last year when i wanted to come back and play at home and it didnt work out
6713708 as soon as dennis got the job he was very clear with me with what he expected and put some faith in me and i think weve got a team where i can play a role that suits me its a nice phase in my career right now
6713709 if i win ill especially dedicate my success to rafa hes a very important person in my life i hope to god i can take another gold to liverpool

6713720 i will take care of my own needs i will seek the power in me and overcome i can lead myself into victory

6713722 keegan pafford and gallagher hogan are two backs who were in the upper echelon in our division last year we have some depth at qb and we have some skill people

6713727 were like a lot of teams in that we have to avoid injuries barring those injuries we certainly will be competitive

6713739 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6713740 the reality is that barack obamas plans to raise taxes and opposition to producing more energy here at home as gas prices skyrocket show hes completely out of touch with the concerns of average americans
6713741 somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have and he said im not sure ill have to check with my staff true quote im not sure ill have to check with my state so they asked his staff and he said at least four at least four

6713745 the feeling in practice isnt much different than the previous two years
6713746 at least its not different yet i think the upperclassmen are a bit more aware of whats coming and are excited
6713747 we hope the last two years allowed us to put enough into the offense and defense to be able to keep up with our opponents
6713748 i know we will suffer through some growing pains this season but we hope we can just focus on getting better each week and have some fun playing ball together
6713749 as for me and the other coaches we are excited but we are just too busy coaching and worrying to show it

6713806 i am concerned about the issue and have asked the commissioner to look at it as a priority
6713807 i will be looking for the best way to ensure that sport and recreational clubs have safe operating practices without onerous requirements
6713808 over a number of years various groups have requested that the act be repealed because the legislation is fundamentally flawed
6713809 my colleagues and i cannot understand why common sense has not prevailed

6713813 kung gusto niya why not yeah pero ako kasi nababataan pa ako sa kanya e hes only 27 i mean let him enjoy his life muna his being single
6713814 kasi ang talagang pabaon sa akin ng mama ko noon that time ay dalawang pandesal at gatas laging ganon tapos kahit ano pa ang pagkain namin ang inumin namin talaga noon gatas

6713818 tatlong bayan ang pinupuntahan ko every day i see to it na umaandar ang mga proyekto ko at inaalam ko kung ano ang problema ng bawat probinsiya
6713819 hindi ba ang batangas is a barako country so nung nag umpisa ako yung mga constituents ko lalo na yung mga barako from the other party pag binabati ko sila ngingitian ko tinitingnan lang ako parang minamaliit talaga ako pero nung nagsimulang umandar na ang mga proyekto ko nakita nila na iba ako na kapag sinabi kong gagawin ko gagawin ko talaga at nangyayari ang maipagmamalaki ko nga sa kanila mas lalaki pa ako kausap kesa sa iba
6713820 sinasabi ko agad sa kanila na pasensiya na pero wala pa talaga tayong budget para sa inyo sinasabi ko kaagad at di ko na pinapaasa pa pero kung kayang gawin kayang abutin ginagawa namin for example kung may problema ang isang lalawigan kakausapin ko kung sino ang in charge sa budget itatanong ko kung bakit hindi magawa o kung ano ang dapat gawin para magawa agad kung kaya namang gawin at may available resources basta makita ko na kaya pipirmahan ko kaagad yung papel walang problema roon
6713821 siguro nga dahil sa vilma santos na ako its a big factor being vilma santos for example yung mga kapitan ng baranggay na humihiling sa akin for their projects tinapat ko na agad sila na wala muna po tayong hard project for the baranggays its all soft kasi ang binigyan ko pong pinakamalaking budget yung provincial roads so hindi ko po mailalagay yan for 2008 so maybe next year balik na lang po kayo para sa resolusyon nyo so sabi nila talaga po bang hindi puwede sabi ko hindi po talaga sabi na lang nila o sige po puwede pong pa picture na lang siyempre its the least i can do for them wala naming problema sa akin saka alam naman nila na they will have their turn once matapos ko yung isang lugar or project tinutupad ko ang pangako ko
6713822 kung gusto niya why not yeah pero ako kasi nababataan pa ako sa kanya e hes only 27 i mean let him enjoy his life muna his being single

6713839 a man becomes thinner and thinner day by day he is wasting away what can the matter be he does not suffer want no certainly not says the physician it doesnt come from that it comes precisely from eating from the fact that he eats out of season eats without being hungry uses stimulants to arouse a little bit of appetite and in that way he ruins his digestion fades away as if he were suffering want so it is religously the most fatal thing of all is to satisfy a want which is not yet felt so that without waiting till the want is present one anticipates it likely also uses stimulants to bring about something which is supposed to be a want and then satisfies it and this is shocking and yet this is what they do in the religious sphere whereby they really are cheating men out of what constitutes the significance of life and helping people to waste life

6713848 the economy now looks set to grow by just 1 2 percent or so this year with a very strong chance of a technical recession in the second half
6713849 cold war sentiment supported oil prices as tensions increased between the west and russia over the deployment of a us missile system in poland sparking fears of disruption to supply
6713850 i mean after so long all i could do was hear her on the phone now i can see her so its a good thing
6713851 i was so excited for andy coming home but yet i knew that matt his brother was leaving so its been tough
6713852 quite a few more cars than they were expecting with about 40 vehicles on the road from christchurch earlier estimates had put the number at 30
6713853 we have hired out a plain van a lot of students are doing the same to try to avoid the police but we have heard that there is a major road block just outside of dunedin most of the cars will be searched anyway
6713854 im not going to lie and tell you that i spend all my spare time sunbathing because its very obvious that i dont
6713855 but when my bloke and i decided to do the dirty pictures thing it was a beautiful wa
6713856 i got my piercing and tattoos just because i could and thats why i posed for nn too
6713857 im sure ive done more guys than most girls my age but i wont do just anybody im picky and real careful
6713858 sticking our head in the sand under the banner of no new taxes or no new fees is i think both irresponsible and a formula for failure
6713859 were going to have to start buying them in gross or manufacturing them ourselves or something
6713860 the current funding model for transportation needs in north carolina is failing us and will continue to fail us going forward

6713865 some customers have told us they want to be able to run windows server and linux together seamlessly but in many cases they need help with the transition to suse linux enterprise server from other linux environments
6713866 there is a lot of concern over how slow it is going
6713867 we really need the same level of functionality in network infrastructure to make it departments jobs more feasible and ultimately this has to come from the vendors
6713868 china for example is one of the biggest users of ipv6
6713869 so at some point your web site will only be accessible by developed countries still using ipv4 and you wont be able to sell your goods inwardly into developing countries
6713870 the first question organisations need to answer is whether their turnover rates are outside the norm and need addressing
6713871 the typical organisation in todays environment can view a five per cent staff turnover as a normal cost of doing business
6713872 it managers often worry that investments in training will be reaped by other organisations when it workers shop their new skills around
6713873 but this study indicates that investing in training is actually the best way to retain employees
6713874 while offering competitive salaries and benefit packages may be important for recruitment providing quality of life incentives and enhancing working environments are more important for retention
6713875 while many textbooks and articles have created the myth that the internet protocols were designed for warfare environments the top level goal for the darpa internet program was the sharing of large service machines on the arpanet
6713876 as a result many protocol specifications focus only on the operational aspects of the protocols they specify and overlook their security implications
6713877 in many cases vendors have implemented quick fixes to protocol flaws without a careful analysis of their effectiveness and their impact on interoperability
6713878 the answer is yes we are but i dont want to say we are ready for anything
6713879 no matter what there are certainly situations that no one can be prepared for
6713880 we have been trying to balance what is reasonable to prepare for and what we will likely be faced with and prepare to up staff as needed
6713881 it increases our success rate because we are all part of the same team
6713882 we will definitely be in the loop of whats happening
6713883 we are just making sure we have a robust communications plan for the whole thing
6713884 if someone is too intoxicated they will go to denver cares
6713885 we know thats going to happen we know there will be some protests and some that will go beyond what most protests do we know there will be attempts to disrupt the whole process whether police use methods that require medical attention or protesters use methods that require medical attention its likely to happen
6713886 specifically we do not know what high risk events may or may not occur
6713887 i was told to breastfeed upon departure and arrival because thats when their ears are popping so its nice that theyre distracted

6713892 a full investigation is being conducted police and the information commissioner have been informed
6713893 the transfer of data on this assignment to the external contractor has been suspended
6713894 it is deeply worrying that after a number of major data losses and the publication of two government reports on high profile breaches of the data protection act more personal information has been reported lost it is vital that sensitive information such as prisoner records is held securely at all times
6713895 this is a massive failure of duty what is more scandalous is that it is not the first time that the government has been shown to be completely incapable of protecting the integrity of highly sensitive data rendering them unfit to be charged with protecting our safety
6713896 charlie chaplin could do a better job running the home office than this labour government after this revelation people will start wondering whether ministers are capable of keeping any data safe anywhere in the country

6713913 we applaud all the members of our team as well as the support from anheuser busch for their dedication and constant on site coordination their work added to the festival s enjoyment for everyone attending it was truly a team effort that resulted in record beer sales

6713917 one of our strengths here at blitz is that we hire individuals straight out of university because we can spot talent these guys are enthusiastic and theyre talented
6713918 theyre smaller and therefore less experienced and have less infrastructure but we bring that theyre working on our technology
6713919 the relationship we have with the people at blitz is incredible
6713920 theyve put a huge amount of trust in us and yet theyre not precious at all theres no rigid design doc its a fluid two way process if weve got any trouble even things not related to the project but about the studio theyre there to give us advice and pointers
6713921 we came to them with quite a defined game document and a framework of what the levels were going to be but we welcome any input they have and they have this great system of all sitting down to play the game together making copious amounts of notes
6713922 we both egg each other on to greater heights which can sometimes be missing when you do things internally you dont look at it from outside and see if this is as good as it can be because weve got two groups at the opposite ends of the country bouncing things backwards and forwards in between them it creates this great feeling of making a game as good as it can be and its been working really well
6713923 the business plan behind arcade is to do smaller games part of the reason of doing it is creativity new fresh original games without having to sit within a constrictive licence
6713924 but the other part is the chance that it gives you smaller games are easier to put externally which gives us flexibility
6713925 plus i really do need it especially in the first trimester because if its good for me it must be good for baby too

6713932 beginning in 2005 we started noticing a pronounced loss of kegs during our annual audit by anheuser busch
6713933 distributors are billed for the missing kegs city beverage was not alone in the significant funds we expended to replace the stolen kegs it is an industry wide problem
6713934 because of our relationship with sister companies city beverage and kalamazoo beer distributing fpt quickly became involved in spreading awareness to our industry the wide ranging portfolio of companies allowed us to gain knowledge of the growing number of keg thefts early on
6713935 if there is no available market the kegs will be returned to the retailer and ultimately the distributor
6713936 all kegs are stamped with the owners name anyone attempting to redeem them will have to prove ownership
6713937 this new law will help us to get our arms around this problem
6713938 our ongoing and historical policy is not to accept kegs

6713997 sdbs it stands for sell design build sell sdbs is in contrast to designing something building it and then trying to sell it which is the model most big and small tech companies follow a lot of start ups are based on hypotheses they build something and start interacting with customers and never verify it what they are doing is rationalizing the hypothesis rather than evaluating it and verifying it
6713998 if you do this you will be incredibly fast in learning and you can pick one of your ideas with confidence
6713999 at one point in time we had three different businesses in play and were trying to figure out which ones would stick
6714000 unlike typical start ups we spent a lot of time on validation
6714001 it has paid off in spades all of the money we are now investing is in the right place
6714002 the concept is that there is a very small minority of customers out there who are called lead users
6714003 lead users are typically people who have such a strong need or pain that they go out and build something on their own to solve the pain the goal of the process is to be able to identify those lead users identify how they are solving their problem then bring it back and commercialize the product for the majority of the market
6714004 for a country like saudi arabia one of the most important sources of energy to look at and to develop is solar energy
6714005 one of the research efforts that we are going to undertake is to see how we make saudi arabia a center for solar energy research and hopefully over the next 30 to 50 years we will be a major megawatt exporter
6714006 our potential in thermal solar power is four times the worlds energy consumption so you can have all the ambitions you want with that
6714007 decisions on political grounds rather than on the basis of what was economically sound
6714008 there is no realization at the highest level of government about the gravity of the situation the toughest days are coming
6714009 people who are aware of the problems dont want to deal with the political cost of admitting them
6714010 tough medicines but they must be taken with the consent of the patient
6714011 though i have always found him to be rational and knowledgeable

6714043 the first half of 2008 was the coolest for at least five years the world meteorological organisation wmo said on wednesday
6714044 summer heat continues in short supply continuing a trend that has dominated much of the 21st centurys opening decade
6714045 there have been only 162 days 90 degrees or warmer at midway airport over the period from 2000 to 2008 thats by far the fewest 90 degree temperatures in the opening nine years of any decade on record here since 1930
6714046 the almanacs 2009 edition which goes on sale tuesday says at least two thirds of the country can expect colder than average temperatures with only the far west and southeast in line for near normal readings
6714047 based on the past armagh measurements this suggests that over the next two decades global temperatures may fall by about 2 degrees c that is to a level lower than any we have seen in the last 100 years

6714050 the point is that we all have to pull together and face up our individual and collective responsibility
6714051 not to cut them off out of self righteous disdain or even worse indifference
6714052 we want everyone in the world to know the truth about the terrible events in tskhinvali it was a huge act of aggression on the part of the georgian army this is not yet a known story in the world but im sure the truth will be coming through

6714058 it was so good and close we decided we had expand the number of semifinalists it was that close
6714059 we had to close it out early because of the high demand
6714060 even if we turn frisbee back to the town that process will take two to three years and these improvements would have already paid for themselves

6714064 we heard that our customers wanted the cards so we provided them
6714065 the majority of our hallmark crown stores are independently owned so they order what they want
6714066 i already try to carry some cards that suggest it fills that need people request them and we try to be responsive
6714067 weve been pleased in new hampshire to pass a civil union law we celebrate civil unions and at each i say i hope soon to be able to say were celebrating a marriage
6714068 we feel everyone should have the right to be who they are
6714069 if theres to be a marriage why should it have to be a man and a woman i know of a couple two women who have been together 28 years i am a hallmark customer so i will be in thanking them for doing this
6714070 they always had a bride and groom on it never anything that can be construed as a same sex couple thats a shame

6714081 the old school of thought on home building was to build it so the house would breathe
6714082 the new school is to build it as tight as you can then manually control the air flow for health we do this with a fan system it moves the air flow through the house

6714094 this is such a wonderful opportunity to share stories with families of others
6714095 its a time for families to remember their dear ones who are not just soldiers they are people brothers fathers and friends mike was a special person in looking back you dont often reflect on a 24 year old life but its been two and half years since he was killed in action and i remain amazed at the power his 24 years continues to have on people
6714096 she stayed in the back tears streaming down her face
6714097 we didnt know who she was she went to my father after and said i didnt have a lot of friends in high school but mike always said hello to me he could make you smile laugh and he could turn your day around
6714098 the goal is to keep the flavor of the original barn

6714105 whats alleged is pretty serious flashing a knife at a child
6714106 we are starting small but we plan to build on it each year and hopefully one year be 100 percent green
6714107 i dont think it was a question of why doesnt the seafood festival recycle
6714108 its more like why doesnt hampton beach recycle by doing this we are hoping others will follow in our footsteps and start to recycle
6714109 the last time we did it people were just throwing their trash in the recycling containers
6714110 this time around we wanted to make everyone more aware on why they are there
6714111 we decided to pick the biggest item that we can recycle which was plastic bottles and start there
6714112 each year we add something else and eventually the goal is to have the seafood festival a completely recycled event
6714113 its an investment for us to do this but its well worth it
6714114 we will also have a recycling education tent signs and regular announcements during the festival
6714115 we cant police every trash can but we can get the word out there
6714116 i think that just strengthened our commitment to go green and stay clean
6714117 they make us hate one another without them we could go anywhere say china and have tea wed communicate fine through sign language i think this exhibit should be on the desk of every politician who wants this technology
6714118 he the mayor was a little boy when the bombs were dropped
6714119 his mother was trapped under a huge concrete beam he couldnt get it off being just a boy his mother told him to go and do something good with his life
6714120 i guess they really wanted to show the world what we could do
6714121 people to this day are being affected by the radiation
6714122 it takes a while to get our inspections done especially when were waiting a few months to get his portion completed
6714123 we usually dont perform tests with items on his list still pending
6714124 we performed a test the first week in july 2008 knowing that he hadnt completed items on the list i think we kind of bent over backwards to accommodate him
6714125 im just never going to recommend that money be paid before the items are complete
6714126 it took a while to get a number of things done
6714127 there was a lack of communication it probably goes both ways i think theres certainly enough blame on both sides of this
6714128 as soon as the town was notified they approved money at the next meeting
6714129 i have to commend the selectmen for getting this done so quickly
6714130 once chairman canada and the other two selectmen had been informed it only took a week for money to be secured
6714131 you hate to add any other burden to people when theyre feeling it at the grocery store and pump but i dont really see any other choice here
6714132 were gearing up with the start of school right around the corner
6714133 i think its in the best interests of the town to look at it
6714134 just like we are taking a look at police numbers
6714135 all i have is a resignation and i dont know why he resigned
6714136 somethings broke and we need to find out how to fix it
6714137 there are a number of ways we could change the job position
6714138 i think we would do well to not rush into the position of hiring like for like in this job
6714139 they should recommend what the responsibilities of the park ranger are and are not
6714140 i think there are a number of opinions on what it should be
6714141 that was exactly the race plan we wanted that is what we have been working on all year how to race an olympic final
6714142 in the first two strokes there was no doubt i was going to win the race no one was going to come past me i felt fantastic
6714143 four years ago i had unfinished business i was good four years ago but i wasnt this good
6714144 the guys at the last olympics deserved to get those medals
6714145 it doesnt really feel real but that was what we have been working towards
6714146 the times when you are absolutely falling to pieces in training this is what it is for and what it has resulted in
6714147 it wasnt about thinking it was too much or i wasnt capable it was just that when i was playing i was not enjoying it one little bit
6714148 when steve mcclaren was appointed he rang me and asked me to return he also came down to training and asked if i fancied it
6714149 i am 34 in november and hope to still be playing when i am 35
6714150 the alpha flying inc planesense program remains a rapidly growing and viable aircraft fractional ownership program with 33 pilatus pc 12 aircraft currently under fractional management with many more on order to support continuing expansion whether or not the grob spn aircraft is brought to certification and production
6714151 the planesense program which allows individuals and companies to purchase shares of aircraft to fit their needs and budgets continues to have confidence that grob will resolve its current difficulties as many aircraft manufacturers have done in similar stages of aircraft development
6714152 if grob should not be able to resolve its current insolvency then there are other options available for the acquisition of turbojet aircraft for the planesense program
6714153 the code enforcement officer has absolutely no authority to make that decision
6714154 when the board makes a decision you have to rely on them you have to keep the boards integrity youve already denied this the decision has been made
6714155 i talked with the board the board said if he could come up with a document for store use rather than restaurant use
6714156 id be inclined to say get rid of the seats
6714157 seating or no seating i dont think we are any closer to a solution than before we came in
6714158 wounded warriors and dsusa have totally changed my life and kept me from getting down and showed me that theres things out there i can do
6714159 at low tide you can smell it it smells like roofing tar
6714160 its not necessarily up front harmful but its not a good product to have in an area like that
6714161 its like solidified driveway sealant its not good for water quality but its not directly harmful to life and health
6714162 estart is ideal for motivated students who would like to earn college credit while still in high school
6714163 its also a perfect match for those students who wish to learn more about a college major or career they may be considering
6714164 we felt it was helpful and important to plan a meeting in the seacoast
6714165 i really do appreciate your efforts to understand the needs of the working family in new hampshire
6714166 it is important for us to make sure all families prosper
6714167 there are nine gyres in the world and we assume that every one of them is hoarding plastic
6714168 we can find plastic on every beach around the world all the oceans are linked and they are all exchanging nutrients and debris
6714169 plastics have been found in or around the bodies of 267 species entanglement is a huge issue for marine mammals and also many sea creatures eat plastic
6714170 plastics in the marine environment are like sponges for toxins like ddt other pesticides pcbs another group called pahs that come from the burning of fossil fuels
6714171 they stick to plastic and what happens is a plastic particle becomes a toxic pill
6714172 so the animal consumes these plastics or debris thinking they are food and those toxins will likely come through plastic into the animals body they can then appear up the food chain and potentially onto your dinner plate
6714173 this is a crude attempt to sabotage the topic the plastic packaging types who have contributed to this blog have tried to strangle the debate
6714174 the amount of sea life that feeds on the surface and has a mouth big enough to eat floating plastic in miniscule
6714175 the plastic bottles are merely playing that part of the small fish and accumulating the poisons
6714176 it only covers the surface whereas the pacific is over 10 000 feet deep
6714177 and yes take away the plastic you still have poisons which is another sad fact which we need to deal with
6714178 plastic packaging waste is not recycled it goes to landfill that is why i avoid it like the plague
6714179 it s my view that if everyone went forward following best practice we d probably end up with local authorities doing very similar things
6714180 it turned out to be a cement crusher which had illegally set up and operated in some back yard and blown all over
6714181 i think previous environment ministers have been on record saying that guy fawkes night produces more dioxins
6714182 waste plants of any kind tend to produce objections but they are absolutely essential we shouldn t be afraid of them
6714183 all this week i have been attending the intel developers forum in san francisco and of all the developers conferences
6714184 in case anyone is interested he has decided i will not stray again into the evangelical bear pit except to
6714185 would not be to everyones advantage especially the week before school starts
6714186 the night was exactly what we were expecting and wanted its an excellent opportunity to come together and get ready to work together
6714187 it fits new hampshire because when it comes to retail politics we recognize most people have met the candidates we want to reach out activate and encourage them to get involved on a grassroots level
6714188 ground zero of how to restore our party back to the majority efforts here are part of a team pulling all over the state there are only 11 weekends between now and the election
6714189 he has the experience a lot of problems need to be solved he is his own man not george bush he has proved he can work across the aisle
6714190 as a small business owner i am an endangered species small businesses are a macro of the economy
6714191 a homeowner or handy person that wants to do their own work really needs to be aware that linseed oil has the potential to spontaneously combust in the right circumstances
6714192 people arent really aware of the content or the ingredients that are included in some of these stains
6714193 the damage was pretty much contained to the garage area it never got into the house
6714194 there was some smoke and heat damage within the garage but it was not a total loss
6714195 the fires are being caused by how these rags and the painting materials are being stored after their use
6714196 we have a lot more cooking places down here we find theyll clean up some spilled oil with kitty litter
6714197 when the sun gets to it on a nice summer day it heats up and we have dumpster fires
6714198 theres a lot of things that react theres all sorts of things out there that will spontaneously combust that people dont even realize
6714199 when they get in a closed container like a gas container the rags will heat up and spontaneously combust
6714200 so if its going to do anything it will do it without damaging your property
6714201 for the past two years weve been on our own so to speak this year weve received incentive funds from rockingham county which will see us through oct 31 we are sending out our annual drive letters to the community and businesses and we do a lot of grant writing
6714202 its the time that kids are getting into things they shouldnt experimenting with drugs or alcohol or other inappropriate and sometimes dangerous activities
6714203 the heart and soul of this program he does a fantastic job with activities and ideas to engage kids in a fun and positive way
6714204 its here for the people who really need it and there are people who feel we should increase our fees to the family but we believe strongly that the program is designed for those in need every child should have a place to go after school when their parents are working and we are thrilled to be able once again to offer them that place
6714205 redeemed a spiritual misfit stumbles toward god marginal sanity and the peace that passes all understanding
6714206 this is such a wonderful opportunity to share stories with families of others
6714207 its a time for families to remember their dear ones who are not just soldiers they are people brothers fathers and friends
6714208 in looking back you dont often reflect on a 24 year old life
6714209 but its been 2 years since he was killed in action and i remain amazed at the power his 24 years continues to have on people
6714210 he could make you smile laugh and he could turn your day around he was the guy everyone wanted to be around
6714211 mike and i were roommates our freshmen year at hamilton college
6714212 i lived with him again during our junior year he was absolutely special there was always a smile on his face he could walk in a room and light it up
6714213 if a person is not satisfied it the matter goes to the board of selectmen
6714214 pathetic attempt at an apology falls far short of the mark
6714215 particularly because colins father has stated publicly that the tape of the meeting should be publicly played something that has yet to happen and is apparently being resisted by mr ganotis and the selectmen
6714216 be played so all can see the behavior of mr ganotis
6714217 the price tag is going to be high and the vision has to be strong because you really do have a village center here
6714218 they had a small backhoe in the river at low tide monday with no erosion control
6714219 when work is being done in the riverbed especially at low tide it has to be done in a way that makes sure there is no harm to natural resources
6714220 for example that particular area is spawning grounds for smelt so any kind of equipment we would worry that it would disturb or impact spawning beds
6714221 all those old rocks walls were constructed dry the tide washed in and eroded the soil behind the wall loosening the foundation over time when there was no soil to support it it collapsed
6714222 floods over the past couple of years have caused some erosion and collapse of river banks
6714223 its amazing to do the routine activities of each day in the place where generations of my family did before me they sat in the same chairs lit the same fireplace and slept in the same bed
6714224 sometimes during some of our harsh winter days i wonder how people from these generations kept warm using only the small fireplaces in their homes
6714225 i think that aspect of their lives must have been very difficult
6714226 now for me it feels very safe to live in this house where generations of my family have lived it provides a tremendous sense of belonging not just to the house and family but to the whole community and i feel very fortunate for this
6714227 many people have told me that they can sense a presence in the house it makes me smile when they say this as i know what they are talking about
6714228 individuals who have spent time in the house swear to me that they were not alone when they were and that they heard things
6714229 were really very pleased that were able to get this project started
6714230 a bunch of women had been running together and we said we should put together an team
6714231 im happy to help raise money for womenade and im fortunate to have a very generous circle of family and friends womenade just does such a great job of helping people and i just love to run
6714232 its just something i love and really look forward to
6714233 weve been proud to sponsor several teams over the past years to support the reach the beach event we feel it is a great way to connect folks in the community who want to make a difference with an event that raises money for important community based organizations
6714234 our mission is to improve the health of the community and one of the best ways to do that is to help cultivate these kinds of grass roots initiatives
6714235 at this stage in life as were married and have children i think its very difficult to find a community where you feel welcome and safe this truly becomes a sisterhood where you lean on each other
6714236 i think my stomach muscles last year were more sore than my leg muscles
6714237 you spend basically 24 hours in a van with six women and everyone is laughing you get a few hours of sleep youre running in the rain sun whatever
6714238 you meet people under circumstances you normally wouldnt meet people and you learn to love them
6714239 he used to make friends with everybody i remember when wed go snowboarding with the town recreation program and as soon as he got on the bus hed put a smile on everyones face
6714240 i remember seeing the grille of the truck coming up right in my mirror and then he pushed rick out into traffic
6714241 the guy on a motorcycle hit him and he went flying i ran over to him it seemed like he was only about 50 feet away but my feet felt like they weighed two tons each it seemed like it took forever to get over to him
6714242 josh was only about 20 years old and he has to live with that for the rest of his life
6714243 this road rage is a crazy thing going on in the country right now i think people have lost their courtesy the kindness isnt there but it needs to be when people are driving
6714244 even the people that didnt know rick will see all the fliers we put up every year and at least it reminds them to keep it cool on the road
6714245 its just a whole bunch of little things that started adding up
6714246 i didnt get a sense i was accomplishing anything anymore
6714247 i think weve lost sight of what we really should be focusing on
6714248 are we holding this applicant to a higher standard that we held another applicant weve got to be consistent
6714249 im just wondering if my goals and the goals of others were in conflict here
6714250 i do think were losing a valuable resource in somebody that has tremendous knowledge of the environmental issues in the town and has been working hard to preserve the natural resources of the town
6714251 hes stood up to people that have tried to circumvent those things and he will be a loss in that respect
6714252 i think its a great loss for the town because of the amount of work hes put in on issues that dont come to the public eye
6714253 people were using conservation for their reason for everything when they were never there for every other conservation issue in the past
6714254 my feeling was its a very tricky situation very complex and it should sink or swim on its own merits
6714255 i truly believe theres been a greater awareness not just by the people in exeter but everywhere about what conservation means doing things that are environmentally sound protecting our rivers and so forth
6714256 i think that makes you feel good that you no longer have to get up and be the only one arguing something
6714257 ive loved the working relationship ive had with a lot of people in town i cannot speak more highly of the dpw they have been so great
6714258 the crop of talent we heard this year was just amazing
6714259 it was so good and close we decided we had expand the number of semifinalists it was that close
6714260 the des did a great job of working with businesses without making it an enforcement action we are really glad to be a part of the program
6714261 after the fire in 1996 we had to build the business back up and that took a while
6714262 we hooked up with this program right away we had been doing a lot of the things they asked already its an awesome program and weve been really happy to be involved with it
6714263 epping auto has worked with us since early on in the program
6714264 the program has been very rewarding and weve been fortunate that a number of yards in the state have voluntarily worked on this with us including epping auto
6714265 there are a lot of yards that have yet to get certified and we want to help them we also want to get municipalities involved so they will crack down on illegal yards
6714266 i hope they will look at us and say look what they did even after the fire
6714267 i hope we show them that it is possible it just takes some work
6714268 but other than that we just kept doing what we were doing we just did it even better
6714269 we gave out educational information and published a list of best management practices and held workshops to educate salvage yards throughout the state
6714270 companies have to apply to the state to be recognized then they audit their facilities to be sure they meet requirements in order to be recognized as a green yard you have to go well above and beyond the state standards
6714271 if they dont encourage the select board to settle this matter
6714272 it will involve the cost not only to put the family back but exorbitant legal fees
6714273 i just want my house to go back to normal
6714274 he cleaned out the closet gained access to the water heater and found extensive mold growth and leaky parts
6714275 what we did while i was there was immediately seal the room and draw the mold out of the house we purchased and installed a window fan to pull the room air outside we put plastic on the door under the supervision of the mold mitigation expert
6714276 scott dunn took over as soon as he heard a lawyer was going to negotiate
6714277 mr ruffin has some liability for these circumstances as a result of his long term failure to address the problem
6714278 the seafood festival is happening and applecrest orchards gets up and running that weekend but it the jumper classic should be a benefit to our local economy
6714279 while we were there at myopia the caliber and level of the sport rose
6714280 this is a riders horse show so we take athletes considerations like the training surface seriously
6714281 we have a long relationship with the town we just learned about this situation we will continue to work with you
6714282 this evening promises lots of good family fun and fine entertainment so bring your blankets or lawn chairs and help us end our season in style
6714283 the entire daniel webster council is honored to have these individuals serving our organization
6714284 we have great respect for what the inn of exeter adds to the historic character of downtown
6714285 with any court decision upholding and verifying the decision of the zba were very pleased
6714286 we are just going to continue to persevere follow the courts decisions and see where they go
6714287 the new hampshire supreme court sets a very dangerous precedent for the country and the rest of the state
6714288 come in and tear down old buildings disturb the character and dignity of the district
6714289 disappointed and frustrated are two words i would use to describe the courts decision
6714290 a lot more to be done before the supermarket goes into place
6714291 its tough in more ways than one its almost like playing a pinball machine some plays are good some plays are very lousy maybe with the suits coming forward well have a better shot at this
6714292 store is right for the town of kingston and legally right
6714293 the longer they continue with the appeal the more taxpayers are paying for the counsel to defend itself
6714294 efforts of a few residents who also happen to be abutters and elected officials
6714295 even now when fuel prices are skyrocketing theyve continued to give back to the community
6714296 its different going here yourself and having one of your kids going here
6714297 having them return and all grown up oh thats the best especially if i remember their names
6714298 and thats what i love to do work in the classrooms

6714302 theres a great sense of history with him speaking on the 45th anniversary of martin luther king jr s i have a dream speech
6714303 obama has been an exceptional candidate and weve been happy to play a small part
6714304 i believe that when obama is inaugurated in january it will let the world know that america is back to lead and that we are the greatest nation on earth
6714305 we already know its here so at this point it doesnt really make sense
6714306 we can be a whole lot more productive and accomplish more
6714307 well have intervention on an ongoing basis if a student doesnt understand a specific skill it will be immediately addressed
6714308 its whether or not the student understands a concept as we go along

6714394 sdbs it stands for sell design build sell sdbs is in contrast to designing something building it and then trying to sell it which is the model most big and small tech companies follow a lot of start ups are based on hypotheses they build something and start interacting with customers and never verify it what they are doing is rationalizing the hypothesis rather than evaluating it and verifying it
6714395 if you do this you will be incredibly fast in learning and you can pick one of your ideas with confidence
6714396 at one point in time we had three different businesses in play and were trying to figure out which ones would stick
6714397 unlike typical start ups we spent a lot of time on validation
6714398 it has paid off in spades all of the money we are now investing is in the right place
6714399 the concept is that there is a very small minority of customers out there who are called lead users
6714400 lead users are typically people who have such a strong need or pain that they go out and build something on their own to solve the pain the goal of the process is to be able to identify those lead users identify how they are solving their problem then bring it back and commercialize the product for the majority of the market

6714406 hundreds of degrees below those typically considered in current practice for fire resistance ratings
6714407 our study found that the fires in wtc 7 which were uncontrolled but otherwise similar to fires experienced in other tall buildings caused an extraordinary event
6714408 heating of floor beams and girders caused a critical support column to fail initiating a fire induced progressive collapse that brought the building down
6714409 the investigation was an extensive state of the art reconstruction of the events that affected wtc 7 and eventually led to its collapse
6714410 numerous facts and data were obtained then combined with validated computer modeling that is believed to be close to what actually occurred a single computer simulation of the structural response to fires took about eight months to complete on powerful computing workstations and clusters
6714411 nonetheless the nist investigation of wtc 7 is based on a huge amount of data
6714412 these data come from extensive research interviews and studies of the building including audio and video recordings of the collapse rigorous state of the art computer methods were designed to study and model the buildings collapse these validated computer models produced a collapse sequence that was confirmed by observations of what actually occurred
6714413 when this critical column buckled due to lack of floor supports it was the first domino in the chain
6714414 what followed in rapid succession was a progression of structural failures failure first occurred all the way to the roof line involving all three interior columns on the most eastern side of the building then progressing from east to west across wtc 7 all of the columns in the core of the building failed finally the entire fa ade collapsed
6714415 while the partial or total collapse of a tall building due to fires is a rare event we strongly urge building owners operators and designers to evaluate buildings to ensure the adequate fire performance of the structural system
6714416 of particular concern are the effects of thermal expansion in buildings with one or more of the following features long span floor systems connections not designed for thermal effects asymmetric floor framing and or composite floor systems

6714470 in spite of economic constraints in some markets like the united states on a worldwide basis servers continued to grow in the second quarter of the year
6714471 the most significant driver in the quarter continued to be an upswing in x86 server replacements that started in the first quarter this coupled with web data center build outs and growth in emerging markets produced solid q2 results
6714472 risc itanium unix servers fell 7 9 per cent in shipments but grew 9 4 per cent in revenue indicating that higher end systems were the hardware platforms that drove sales in this space
6714473 we continued to see growth in the second quarter of 2008 in unit and revenue terms boosting the overall performance for the first half of 2008
6714474 continued demand contributed to positive results in emea while a strong euro exchange rate helped drive healthy dollar revenue growth these positive factors have helped to outweigh any potential negative growth influences such as consolidation or short term budgetary constraints
6714475 dell again outpaced its nearest rivals growing 22 1 per cent year on year ibm and fujitsu fsc each lost volume share in the second quarter of 2008 while sun maintained its share position compared to last year accounting for 4 2 per cent of the overall server market

6714551 we are continuing to work to make sure that any timelines that are in the agreement really do reflect what we believe can be done whats feasible
6714552 because the us negotiators indeed showed a great deal of flexibility and understanding
6714553 these documents existed on a state wide web site and now they dont exist and this change has taken place recently
6714554 we only had one striker available to us on tuesday night so i went with a 4 5 1 formation which simply didnt work
6714555 i have marty verner available after suspension and he is chomping at the bit to get going
6714556 darren lockhart missed the game because of work commitments and having someone of his experience will be a big boost to the team
6714557 the players that did play on tuesday night know that we have to be better although i was happy with the second half performance after we changed things around
6714558 a game at home to institute is one that we have to be looking to win
6714559 people will have the two of us down to be fighting it out at the bottom of the table and they may turn out to be right
6714560 my target is to make the top six but i dont know yet if that is realistic if it is to be achieved we have to win this game
6714561 we have beaten ucd twice this season with peter hutton scoring a last minute winner in our 3 2 win in the first game of the season and it was a tough game
6714562 the belfield bowl is always a hard place to get anything because there isnt much of an atmosphere there but we are playing well at the minute and want to continue our recent good form
6714563 we have clocked up a few thousand miles over the last few weeks with games at cobh ramblers galway united kildare even though that was postponed and now ucd but the players have been brilliant
6714564 peter played against kildare on tuesday but he saw a surgeon yesterday and hes due to get an operation next week but he might play this evening well assess it
6714565 we want to be realistic peter has a high pain threshold and hes a tremendous character with a great will to win but at the same time i dont want him struggling through matches because there are good players here who are waiting in the wings
6714566 we want players who are fit enough to play and we dont want him to do himself any harm but if it is manageable well be pleased to have him involved with the squad
6714567 billy is a free agent and he has done well in training with us
6714568 we are only having a look at him at the minute and well just have to wait and see but he looks as though he might be able to a job for us and im planning to talk to him soon
6714569 i had a bit of a heartbreaker when i lost to wenbo 13 12 in the world championships and it took me a long time to get over that
6714570 ive got a new cue now and im very happy with it ive just got rid of the old cue ive been using for the past 10 years because i just wanted a fresh start and i cant wait to get started again
6714571 now with a new cue its like lets start again and have a fresh start and thats what myself and a lot of players tend to do
6714572 im no 20 in the rankings but if id won that match id be in the top 16 and that was a real sickener but then again you have to grin and bear it
6714573 i can accept it whats done is done and you just have to get on with it im not one to mope around for too long i went away on holidays and just enjoyed myself and got things into perspective
6714574 there always seems to be someone coming along to take it to the next level
6714575 we had steve davis then we had hendry and then osullivan and now you have the chinese coming in so everybody seems to be taking it onto the next level and you just have to catch up with them the more tournaments there are the better for us because it gives us a wage and helps us make a living
6714576 i go in hoping to win it and what better dream than to win a ranking tournament in your hometown
6714577 im just looking forward to getting started and going back to basics there are no easy games any more maybe 10 15 years ago there were but its very close now
6714578 i always get a lot of support here because its only once a year that the people of belfast get a chance to come out and watch us
6714579 when he qualified he said to me that the one fight he wanted was shiming in front of his home crowd and now its happening i am just so proud how could i not be
6714580 i always knew he would make it to the olympics and i always knew he was something special
6714581 it is going to be hard fighting the world champion in his own backyard but its what paddy wanted
6714582 i was very confident when he went out that he would do well
6714583 even though the polish guy had beaten him before it did not surprise me when he won
6714584 paddy has been working on his tactics so when he won 11 5 it shows you that he has been going ok
6714585 hes the fifth individual kid from the holy family club to win an olympic medal its the icing on the cake
6714586 youd want a fistful of pebbles to hit this guy
6714587 these savings are an essential part of getting new yorks fiscal house in order
6714588 in fairness natal sharks were excellent in that he was under contract until the end of their season
6714589 because they have three international props and have signed another player from argentina they have been able to release brendon early
6714590 his medical went well and he was very professional in everything he did and he has gone back home to get his wife who is expecting a baby in november
6714591 he will be here for training on monday september 1 prior to the scarlets game and it will be great to have a full complement of players in time for the start of the new season
6714592 brendon always wanted to be here as early as possible and it is thanks to my counterpart at the sharks brian van zyl that we managed to put a deal together
6714593 paul has taken over responsibility for the backs and is the last piece of the off field jigsaw
6714594 he is still there as a player and he wants to play but with paddy wallace andrew trimble rob dewey and darren cave there is a lot of competition among the midfield backs
6714595 the feedback from all the playing group and matt is that he really is the standout with regard to his analysis of the game and his ability to analyse what was going on
6714596 the report from access economics showing the annual 58 billion cost of obesity to the australian community is alarming and unacceptable the greens will be reintroducing legislation to the senate aimed at tackling the problem beginning with childhood obesity
6714597 in western australia the labor party supported a greens initiative in the upper house to allow for a ban on junk food advertising during childrens tv viewing hours however after lobbying from the chamber of commerce and industry labor back flipped and dropped the measure
6714598 the greens will be reintroducing a democrats bill to ban junk food advertising to the senate
6714599 an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure this policy will cost nothing to implement but will save billions of dollars in health costs
6714600 only 1 per cent of food advertising promotes healthy food the other 99 per cent promotes fast food soft drinks ice cream and other junk food parents need help to ensure their children remain healthy and active and removing the pester power of junk food advertising will do that

6714603 my biggest fear was for the system and the programme because thats what supports the boxers and i was afraid that that might be pulled down
6714604 everything was being questioned but hand on heart i never felt i was under pressure because we always believed that we were in this battle alone the team was a very tight unit we were looking at our mistakes and our frailties and as long as we were doing that we knew we were looking at the solutions too
6714605 we used run on derrynane beach in the morning at the back of daniel oconnells house
6714606 that was the only thing i felt proud about going by that house every morning but we were left to prepare on our own spar with each other sure we were mates were never going to kill each other you know what i mean youre not going to push
6714607 the training they do the commitment they put in giving up their lives their education putting everything on hold to try and be an olympian and do well out of it
6714608 five points up with six minutes to go beaten by a point
6714609 threw my hurley down that day and said im going to go to the olympic games f k this
6714610 if you dont take a risk you dont achieve and weve been taking risks for the last five years we failed on a number of occasions we went down in the gutter and thats probably whats made us what we are now
6714611 it has been a long pre season for me and it was great to get out against bath and play some rugby at ravenhill a place i have heard so much about
6714612 the crowd were great for a friendly game and the team spirit was great even though we lost the team spirit was great
6714613 there is still a lot of work that needs to be done and we will look to build on that against queensland
6714614 to get the first game under my belt and feel positive about it has been a big boost for me and i just cant wait for tonights game
6714615 we will aim to improve our setpieces our defence and overall our game needs patching up and a bit of fine tuning here and there and get the combinations right
6714616 aiden toua has done well for easts in the premier competition and was quite explosive at times during the barbarians game
6714617 the beauty of a trip like this is that it gives our young guys the opportunity to play high quality opposition in intimidating settings
6714618 i have always believed that the best contract agreements are those that are reached at the bargaining table and this is a good example of that
6714619 the contract provides stability to a key labor force in our city
6714620 ive never been shy to stand on the steps of city hall and say when something is wrong
6714621 well im equally not shy to stand inside city hall and say something is right

6714624 she usually did so in a very understated way calling attention by calling special attention to it by keeping it extra quiet sort of the psst shes married to a rockefeller kind of way its like saying you went to harvard it opens doors
6714625 but she wanted to keep the appearance of it going for her it was much for keeping appearances
6714626 she is the youngest woman ever to be elected to director of mckinsey amp company and many of her colleagues who were friendly with me believed it had a lot to do with me and my name
6714627 between the two of us i dont think it ever came up specifically as to like you know lets look up in the family tree but she knew early on that i had virtually not much in common with the rockefeller family
6714628 i always told everyone well i really dont know and i left it at that
6714629 how can he be sorry when i understand i was the 12th victim

6714740 the bengali regional genre has shown a substantial growth in the past two years in comparison with other regional entertainment markets and with this new channel we will try to bring a new level of diversity to the world of entertainment
6714741 at first there was a sort of rivalry between the two of us and pat
6714742 it was always a friendly rivalry as we have been friends and playing soccer together since we were really young
6714743 we ended up not liking keene and pat put it in our heads that plymouth was a fun school the guys on the team were great and the coach was a good guy
6714744 george and i both talked to the plymouth coach and the next year we went to plymouth we never really planned in high school to go to the same college it just kind of happened
6714745 the three of us together is great because we know each others play styles very well so we mesh well
6714746 i think all three of us are aware its our last year so theres a lot of incentive to have a good season
6714747 in fact we have a very old team altogether so we all want this season to be a great one the ncaa tournament is the goal so we need to win the little east conference
6714748 the feeling in practice isnt much different than the previous two years
6714749 at least its not different yet i think the upperclassmen are a bit more aware of whats coming and are excited
6714750 we hope the last two years allowed us to put enough into the offense and defense to be able to keep up with our opponents
6714751 i know we will suffer through some growing pains this season but we hope we can just focus on getting better each week and have some fun playing ball together
6714752 as for me and the other coaches we are excited but we are just too busy coaching and worrying to show it
6714753 it was more than what i expected i expected it to be fun but it was more than fun
6714754 everything about the country was great the lifestyle the people the soccer it was just amazing how much they love soccer over there
6714755 on our way to practice or games there would be people of all age groups playing soccer and if they werent playing they had a soccer ball in their hands
6714756 its not about nice cleats or a nice field in argentina
6714757 its all about the love of the game everyone was everywhere playing streets dirt driveways parks there were people playing
6714758 we were on our way back from a late match against river plate intramural and it was about 12 30 at night and every park was filled with teams and people training it was unbelievable
6714759 i would say that what was the most impressive is how much they love futbol
6714760 the level of play was very different from what im used to
6714761 they possessed the ball very well the playing was way more physical than here in the states
6714762 a rule that we learned really quick was the high kick or the dangerous play rule they dont have that in argentina its just a rule here in the states so high kicks close to your face are legal as well as playing the ball while youre on the ground that was hard to cope with
6714763 they were the best team we played we were nervous and getting used to the style of play we had our chances missing two breakaways and i had a shot outside the 18 that hit the crossbar but it was a good wake up of what we were up against
6714764 the next game we played against river plate intramural they were a great team as well we played under the lights turf field in river plate stadium grounds
6714765 our last match was against club atletico atlanta an argentine b division professional team
6714766 they had three players who played matches in the professional league and we tied them 2 2
6714767 they were a quick team i would say the fastest pace team we played
6714768 our tour guide got us tickets at the last minute and it was awesome
6714769 i came back to school to start soccer on august 8 and we have been going full steam ever since
6714770 moving up to division i is definitely going to be a challenge for us but were extremely excited and believe in ourselves and each other that we will be successful
6714771 unfortunately because we are not yet official members of the nec northeast conference we are not allowed to compete for a championship
6714772 but we are excited for the chance to get our name out there and show whats in store for the upcoming years
6714773 moving up to division i is a five year process to be officially titled division i
6714774 last year was our transitional phase so this year is declared the first year of the complete transition
6714775 there are numerous factors that go into the decision to move up with a major one being the desire for bryant to increase diversity and enrollment by expanding out of new england and catching interest in other areas
6714776 as far as athletics go the sports teams have done exceptionally well in the northeast 10 conference which is the hardest division ii conference with many teams getting a bid into the ncaa tournament
6714777 last year was our most successful year as we had an undefeated conference season only to lose in the conference final but making it to the second round of the ncaa and finishing with a 17 2 5 record
6714778 the difference between high school and college soccer is huge
6714779 in high school the competition is not always the best your team consists of players of all different levels and it really doesnt matter whether you had a bad game or not
6714780 in college it is the complete opposite you are playing with extremely talented players from all different states in a league where less talented teams do not exist
6714781 the intensity pace of the game talent of your teammates and opponents and commitment is incomparable to what you face in high school
6714782 i have really enjoyed myself at bryant the past two years and am really looking forward to my senior year
6714783 ive been through many changes since my transition from west point after my freshman year and am extremely happy i ended up where i am now
6714784 i have met some unbelievable people as well as been fortunate enough to be a part of a team whom i consider my family away from home
6714785 i truly love the game and wish to never have to give it up but i will instead be switching my focus to working on getting my professional career in order although i wont be playing competitively anymore i definitely plan to stay involved in the sport for many years to come through the various womens leagues and summer leagues in the area
6714786 as far as soccer goes we are very aware that this transition will be a challenge for us
6714787 we are moving into unfamiliar territory as far as not having played these teams before and not knowing what exactly to expect but we are confident in our ability as a team to be able to compete at this higher level
6714788 every year during preseason we establish team goals that we aim to achieve after each game and by the end of the season so if we continue to improve game by game then we will know that we have been successful in meeting our end of season goals
6714789 we lost in the semifinals of the conference my sophomore year and lost in the final my junior year so it was disappointing for us not to be able to get that last chance at winning the title so instead because it is our last year we are going to focus on doing the best we can to compete and do well in order to help pave the way for our underclassmen to be successful in the future
6714790 at the beginning of the season i expected to improve at every race but i wanted timberman to be my best race
6714791 i really wanted to finish in the top 20 of my age group but thought that my bike time might fall short so i thought top 30 was more realistic
6714792 timberman is well attended by not just the racers but spectators and the local community all come out to show support thats what makes it great as you hear total strangers calling out your number or your name to cheer you on
6714793 these all out sprints will help me as i move up to the olympic and maybe 70 3 half ironman distances next year which will require a lot more working out
6714794 when you have podium finishers top three in age group as your training partners you are forced to work harder they not only provide you with a lot of support but they indirectly push you as well
6714795 at the end of every race we begin the analyzing process of our times looking back on where we could save a few seconds i am still on cloud nine about my efforts but i still have three more races to go so im already making changes to my transitions to shave off even more time even if only a few seconds
6714796 the timberman is well attended by pro and highly competitive age groupers from all around the u s and from other countries
6714797 olympic hopefuls and world champions usually will have this race on their schedule
6714798 chrissie wellington who won last years hawaii ironman won the timberman womens half ironman the first female who won the sprint event was pro cate snow who just won the lake placid ironman in july her husband tim snow also a pro was the first male
6714799 snows words at the awards podium surmised that in his opinion winning in a sprint can be a lot harder than a full ironman as one has to go all out and be aware of every second
6714800 the start of the swim is always a little scary
6714801 you are ensured that you will get kicked and bumped and this race was no exception it took a couple of minutes before i was able to free up into somewhat open water
6714802 swimming is my weakest event i was happy that when i looked at my time as i exited the water that i was almost exactly on target for my race goal 10 52 finish
6714803 timberman is by general consensus one of the hardest bike courses in the area the first seven miles of both the sprint and the 70 3 half ironman are the same and are considered the most demanding consisting of rolling hills with not a lot of straight stretches to really hammer
6714804 the first half mile is uphill the next 14 5 miles went by so quickly when i reached the turnaround i knew that if i kept at it i would make my goal of 54 minutes on the bike when i reached the dismount area and saw that i had done it in 52 50 i was elated
6714805 all i had to do was run my usual pace and i would finish well within my goal when i got to the turnaround at 1 5 miles i got some high fives from some of my friends from tryfury her triathlon club and this made me push a little harder i finished with my best run split ever 7 33 per mile
6714806 my overall time was two minutes faster than my original goal time i could hardly take my timing chip off at the end and i knew that i had given all i had and that is what makes this all fun when you can push yourself to do something that you do not think you are capable of doing
6714807 there was a bit of peer pressure presented by my in laws
6714808 the pressure was that i could either race with them or stay home again to babysit with grandma
6714809 maybe ill go for the half ironman distance in 2010 when i turn 40 timberman is right around my birthday so its a good present to myself
6714810 if i wasnt hooked before i sure am now what a great weekend
6714811 my biggest improvement was in the swim followed closely by the bike

6714816 its the time that kids are getting into things they shouldnt experimenting with drugs or alcohol or other inappropriate and sometimes dangerous activities
6714817 the heart and soul of this program he does a fantastic job with activities and ideas to engage kids in a fun and positive way
6714818 its here for the people who really need it and there are people who feel we should increase our fees to the family but we believe strongly that the program is designed for those in need every child should have a place to go after school when their parents are working and we are thrilled to be able once again to offer them that place

6714832 i remember seeing the grille of the truck coming up right in my mirror and then he pushed rick out into traffic

6714839 its amazing to do the routine activities of each day in the place where generations of my family did before me they sat in the same chairs lit the same fireplace and slept in the same bed
6714840 sometimes during some of our harsh winter days i wonder how people from these generations kept warm using only the small fireplaces in their homes
6714841 i think that aspect of their lives must have been very difficult
6714842 now for me it feels very safe to live in this house where generations of my family have lived it provides a tremendous sense of belonging not just to the house and family but to the whole community and i feel very fortunate for this
6714843 many people have told me that they can sense a presence in the house it makes me smile when they say this as i know what they are talking about
6714844 individuals who have spent time in the house swear to me that they were not alone when they were and that they heard things

6714891 thats the first game lee played in for the beavers
6714892 we didnt even find out until after the game that he was previously on the ravens the beavers are a good team though regardless of if they have him or not we did good and we showed that we have talent the guys who we had covering him played really well and lee didnt even break 100 yards
6714893 there is a lot more talent this year too and a lot of the guys from last year have a year under their belt and learned the game while most teams have 30 35 players tops right now we have a roster of 40 legitimate ballplayers and they are all very capable
6714894 you come to work everyday and you dont quit on things

6714898 there are a number of teams in new england we are going to be pushing the problem that we all face in this area is the challenge of pool space it would be great if we could use this as a launch off to keep pools open or make more
6714899 one year after the olympics we had our tryout for the lesson program which basically is learning about the sport
6714900 we had a line outside the pool and in the lobby and into the parking lot over 100 kids tried out that day
6714901 its the success a lot of good athletes just tend to gravitate toward swimming because of the success if you get a bunch of new people to try out and even half of them decide its not for them you have more people on the team that wouldnt have tried if it wasnt for the olympics
6714902 swimming is not necessarily looked on as a mainstream boys sports
6714903 phelps has given validity to the masculine aspect of the sport hes incredibly in shape and athletic even the basketball team was there rooting him on hes definitely been positive for the visibility of the sport
6714904 i think michael phelps that name will last a long time in the mainstream
6714905 the information i have is that if theyre leaving it is at a snails pace
6714906 wounded warriors and dsusa have totally changed my life and kept me from getting down and showed me that theres things out there i can do

6714910 seabrooks stephan lewis our running back has been a standout player this year
6714911 he hasnt been 100 percent but being the level player he is hes still been able to excel derek vater is another key player he blew out his knee last year and is just getting back into peak form he was a key last week with four touchdown passes
6714912 only the top two teams receive a bye we would love to be one of the top two but we would also be happy with a third or fourth place finish ultimately our goal is obviously to make it to the championship game we are tied for third in our conference right now and we need to separate ourselves
6714913 exeter is just a great step up and it allows us to market ourselves a little bit better we have been all over the place we have played at winnacunnet high school and portsmouth high school raymond and haverhill mass but exeter is the best facility out of all of them
6714914 its all based on the enclosure itself a structural insulating panel
6714915 the panels make up the wall structure instead of a stud wall its a pre fabricated panelized system a tighter house
6714916 the old school of thought on home building was to build it so the house would breathe
6714917 the new school is to build it as tight as you can then manually control the air flow for health we do this with a fan system it moves the air flow through the house
6714918 swimming isnt as visible in this part of the country as say florida and south california and texas
6714919 there are a number of teams in new england we are going to be pushing the problem that we all face in this area is the challenge of pool space it would be great if we could use this as a launch off to keep pools open or make more

6714925 i think michael phelps that name will last a long time in the mainstream
6714926 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6714927 if they dont encourage the select board to settle this matter
6714928 it will involve the cost not only to put the family back but exorbitant legal fees
6714929 i just want my house to go back to normal
6714930 he cleaned out the closet gained access to the water heater and found extensive mold growth and leaky parts
6714931 what we did while i was there was immediately seal the room and draw the mold out of the house we purchased and installed a window fan to pull the room air outside we put plastic on the door under the supervision of the mold mitigation expert
6714932 scott dunn took over as soon as he heard a lawyer was going to negotiate
6714933 mr ruffin has some liability for these circumstances as a result of his long term failure to address the problem
6714934 because you work so hard all year and you want to move on
6714935 we live by being aggressive and that was the winning run
6714936 he was just outstanding he is a pure hitter he has a batting cage in his backyard and he swings all day
6714937 we needed to ride on his shoulders to get the job done tonight and he did it
6714938 he has a hard fastball and he knows how to use his other pitches
6714939 i usually try to keep my cool and composure on the mound
6714940 its hard to explain to somebody who doesnt care but for political junkies its like the super bowl and olympics wrapped into one
6714941 particular year has been special and we wouldnt miss this convention for the world
6714942 theres a great sense of history with him speaking on the 45th anniversary of martin luther king jr s i have a dream speech
6714943 obama has been an exceptional candidate and weve been happy to play a small part
6714944 i believe that when obama is inaugurated in january it will let the world know that america is back to lead and that we are the greatest nation on earth
6714945 the price tag is going to be high and the vision has to be strong because you really do have a village center here
6714946 its different going here yourself and having one of your kids going here
6714947 having them return and all grown up oh thats the best especially if i remember their names
6714948 and thats what i love to do work in the classrooms
6714949 ive been dying to find out who my new teacher is
6714950 whats alleged is pretty serious flashing a knife at a child
6714951 i believe im in that six or seven they may look at me as a developmental squad guy thats all right with me as long as i can keep working and learning
6714952 we are starting small but we plan to build on it each year and hopefully one year be 100 percent green
6714953 i dont think it was a question of why doesnt the seafood festival recycle
6714954 its more like why doesnt hampton beach recycle by doing this we are hoping others will follow in our footsteps and start to recycle
6714955 the last time we did it people were just throwing their trash in the recycling containers
6714956 this time around we wanted to make everyone more aware on why they are there
6714957 we decided to pick the biggest item that we can recycle which was plastic bottles and start there
6714958 each year we add something else and eventually the goal is to have the seafood festival a completely recycled event
6714959 its an investment for us to do this but its well worth it
6714960 we will also have a recycling education tent signs and regular announcements during the festival
6714961 we cant police every trash can but we can get the word out there
6714962 i think that just strengthened our commitment to go green and stay clean
6714963 i thought it had to be a hoax because it was all of a sudden
6714964 i want to take this opportunity to apologise for any upset caused we were really shocked to hear what happened and are so sorry to everyone on the street affected by this
6714965 the crop of talent we heard this year was just amazing
6714966 it was so good and close we decided we had expand the number of semifinalists it was that close
6714967 dont take this the wrong way lara but you are supremely out of shape
6714968 we hebben gesmeekt en alles gedaan maar het was nee

6714971 de stichting kind online adviseert ook voorlopig je kinderen te leren deze sites te herkennen en meteen weg te klikken maar je staat als ouder niet permanent naast ze
6714972 we were all born to a mama raised as a child and grew up in america we were given what the world was ready to hand to us and i think it humanizes us without trying to rationalize or testify something
6714973 im going to wear this because it makes the statement that i want to make
6714974 if a person is not satisfied it the matter goes to the board of selectmen
6714975 pathetic attempt at an apology falls far short of the mark
6714976 particularly because colins father has stated publicly that the tape of the meeting should be publicly played something that has yet to happen and is apparently being resisted by mr ganotis and the selectmen
6714977 be played so all can see the behavior of mr ganotis
6714978 even now when fuel prices are skyrocketing theyve continued to give back to the community
6714979 vroeger sloten ze de amoerstraat de hele dag af als chodorkovski hier langskwam en stonden er sluipschutters op de daken het leek wel oorlog onze kinderen waren doodsbang
6714980 het is een verkiezingsjaar bovendien pikken de kraaien nog in het lijk van yukos
6714981 een verdachte moet breken en toegeven dat zijn straf terecht is dat is de kgb mentaliteit net als in orwells 1984
6714982 het dossier is zo chaotisch dat ik niet begrijp waarvan ze hem betichten
6714983 zonder lastige pers of betogingen en in tsjita kun je de verdediging nog beter hinderen
6714984 dit proces is illegaal maar als we de procedure boycotten zijn we onvoorbereid als ze het doordrukken dus werken we maar gewoon door
6714985 de lokale macht wil ook liever van dit proces af
6714986 moskovieten kijken nu steeds over hun schouders mee dat irriteert enorm
6714987 misja is bleek en mager maar heel kalm een beetje gereserveerd hij oordeelt veel milder dan vroeger verdedigt lieden die ik veracht
6714988 we maakten grapjes kun je ons niet leren zo goed te jatten als jij dat vond hij wel aardig
6714989 je hebt de zwarte afdeling een barak met negentig criminelen
6714990 dan heb je de rode afdeling met lui die beschermd worden ex politieagenten pederasten en gekken daar zat chodorkovski
6714991 de avtoriteti verdedigen ons wij geven hun geld tabak wodka en thee ze boden chodorkovski bescherming aan hij had tenslotte nogal wat te bieden maar dat mocht niet van de directie
6714992 denk je dat ze ons met zulke lulkoek lastigvallen wodka drugs sigaretten alles is te koop niemand werkt behalve chodorkovski de regels gelden alleen voor hem
6714993 ik geloof dat we dat verschuldigd zijn aan de kinderen in dit land en aan kinderen in het buitenland
6714994 all in vain have i kept my heart clean and washed my hands in innocence
6714995 has all my believing and striving for holiness been in vain
6714996 when i thought how to understand this it seemed to me a wearisome task until i went into the sanctuary of god then i discerned the wickeds end
6714997 let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering for he who promised is faithful and let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works not neglecting to meet together as is the habit of some but encouraging one another and all the more as you see the day drawing near
6714998 this is such a wonderful opportunity to share stories with families of others
6714999 its a time for families to remember their dear ones who are not just soldiers they are people brothers fathers and friends
6715000 in looking back you dont often reflect on a 24 year old life
6715001 but its been 2 years since he was killed in action and i remain amazed at the power his 24 years continues to have on people
6715002 he could make you smile laugh and he could turn your day around he was the guy everyone wanted to be around
6715003 mike and i were roommates our freshmen year at hamilton college
6715004 i lived with him again during our junior year he was absolutely special there was always a smile on his face he could walk in a room and light it up
6715005 weve had our eye on it for a while and we think its a great thing to be taking place here in our area
6715006 the legitimate object of government is to do for a community of people whatever they need to have done but can not do for themselves in their separate and individual capacities
6715007 we have to calculate what we want out of state government
6715008 what services do we need then we should determine the cost of those services thats what should determine the state budget
6715009 with unfunded federal mandates like no child left behind more and more of the burden of funding government has been left to the state in new hampshire that ends up coming out of property taxes somethings got to be done
6715010 times are tough but now is not the time to turn our backs on the people
6715011 ignoring things like road repair only comes back to bite us later its the old slogan you can pay me now or you can pay me later
6715012 i was opposed to the ballot measure on the fire stations not because i thought we didnt need them i thought they cost too much thats the kind of scrutiny i want to bring to the state budget when im in concord
6715013 combines the two worst things about america it is violence punctuated by committee meetings
6715014 als wij ergens vragen bij hebben of over iets bezorgd zijn dan is het de gewoonte dat we de overkoepelende organisatie van de sport in kwestie om verder onderzoek vragen
6715015 dat hebben we nu dus ook bij de gymnastiekbond gedaan
6715016 the bigger question then is transparency which is actually the issue that sparked this years discussion of the dispensary systems pros and cons financial transparency mostly

6715039 these constant attacks and devastating violence have no other purpose than to sabotage the tireless efforts and aid that our soldiers and humanitarian workers are brining to the afghan people
6715040 the number of casualties has not changed substantially both in numbers and in relation to the size of the coalition forces over last year
6715041 yes there seems to be a lot more incidents but the number of casualties has not increased in terms of numbers

6715063 were going to look at obvious alternatives natural gas propane anything else that might come along hybrid is something we may see here very soon
6715064 if there is a question mark and we have a concern which we do we ask the governing body of any sport to look into it

6715069 while offering solutions is important we know that real progress will not happen unless stakeholders reach out and work together thats why we are pleased to be here to lend our support as the aha the american cancer society the catholic health association families usa and nfib come together to launch this new campaign
6715070 this trial exemplifies the concept of personalised medicine integrating selection of patients with a specific genetic defect use of a treatment designed to overcome that defect in gene expression and direct assessment of protein function within disease affected tissues the further development of ptc124 could offer a practical means to address the underlying cause of disease in patients with nonsense mutations as the basis for cystic fibrosis
6715071 the nhs has responded impressively to the first five years of the national service framework the government diabetes plan more and more people with diabetes are getting good routine care
6715072 there are clear improvements in diabetes care more and more people are getting the tests and measurements that they need and their outcomes are getting better too
6715073 the rate of progress in diabetes care needs to be much greater in the next five years than weve achieved in the previous five years
6715074 recent figures reveal one in ten deaths in england can be attributable to diabetes with the figure nearly doubling in deprived areas
6715075 in view of such outcomes and the fact that the number of people with diabetes is set to double to 4 million by 2020 this report paints too rosy a picture of the current standard of diabetes care
6715076 this is probably one of the single most significant food safety actions done for fresh produce in many years

6715078 implants have higher patient and partner satisfaction rates than any other therapy
6715079 for a patient with severe erectile dysfunction whos bottomed out in terms of erectile function helping him by implanting a penile prosthesis allows him to immediately perform not only better than his peers but in many respects also even better than he himself ever had in his prime because his implant stays erect until he deflates it he neednt ever worry about not lasting until his partner is satisfied or climaxing too soon
6715080 every year 26 500 people in scotland discover they have cancer 2 and most of those will go on to seek treatment for pain and discomfort regrettably managing cancer pain is a problematic area 3 and half of all patients in western countries may not receive adequate pain relief 4 this free cd rom enables healthcare professionals to explore new ways to manage the pain of patients
6715081 the breaking barriers cd rom is excellent and i will be encouraging my students to obtain a copy if the new generation of health care professionals sustains a high level of skill in pain management it will increase quality of life for patients
6715082 health professionals can be very good at assessing and alleviating pain but there are usually gaps in knowledge that can be filled i would recommend any professional to request the breaking barriers cd rom
6715083 pain is fundamentally a treatable phenomenon it is beholden on us as practitioners to make sure that patients who have got pain are recognised and are directed to appropriate cancer related pain treatment services whether they arrive within our hospitals or within our out patient departments
6715084 i have a rare form of cancer called adenoid cystic carcinoma on the base of my tongue and it has spread to my lungs creating constant pain that even strong treatments didnt stop for long thankfully dr williams and his team of specialists have found a combination of morphine and another drug to keep my pain down to more comfortable levels i had always refused morphine before because i was afraid of addiction and increasing doses but they helped me understand that morphine was the right answer and explained when i should supplement it for best effects they are wonderful
6715085 you cant call yourselves the doors because you cant have the doors without jim morrison
6715086 while the three partners had agreed to the commercial morrison vehemently disagreed and the commercial was not done
6715087 morrison had been adamant against doing commercials and densmore wanted to honor morrisons memory
6715088 these are the same people mr flaherty mr baird mr clement who are responsible for what happened in walkerton who privatized propane inspection and they want to do something equivalent about food inspections which is at the core of what the government should do
6715089 the vast majority of suggestions in the document were up for discussion and have not been implemented
6715090 what we are striving to do is actually do a more proactive role within the plant
6715091 as opposed to having our inspectors standing line by line theyll have a more oversight role within the plant itself
6715092 governments and employers have a duty of care for these workers the abuse and exploitation of people coming into this country to help relieve labour shortages must cease it is clear there is an urgent need for stronger regulation and monitoring of the conditions the 457 visa holders are being employed under

6715095 tau is natively unfolded or floppy so in solution it moves around a lot and can adopt many different structures
6715096 you can measure the lengths of individual molecules and the average will be a pretty good description of any one
6715097 are all over the place theyre so diverse that its difficult to get one measurement that describes all of the possible structures
6715098 we generated lots and lots of structures for both normal tau and a mutant form
6715099 a list of all types of suspect conformations for known tau mutants then from that list we can design drugs for each
6715100 nanotechnology is an exciting new field with the potential to transform environmental protection
6715101 with nanomaterial use increasing every day across industries from healthcare to manufacturing it is essential that we understand the implications of nanotechnology for human health and the environment
6715102 i applaud dr yokel and his research team for earning such a prestigious award
6715103 it is an honor that the epa star program selected uk for the largest single grant it has ever awarded for nanotechnology research this award is a perfect example of why it is so important that kentucky has a world class research university as it shows that the leading faculty and researchers that we have been able to recruit and retain here at uk are among the best in the world
6715104 these findings are encouraging in that the body composition and physical performance changes were not large
6715105 however it would be wise to track soldiers during longer deployments to ensure that no health or performance concerns arise
6715106 the good news is that the negative effects of this deployment were minor and could be quickly ameliorated upon return with a directed physical training program
6715107 a huge blow to millions of people already wondering just how theyre going to pay their bills this winter
6715108 when patients who have a serious health emergency far from home are exposed to different healthcare systems high spending areas are associated with significantly lower mortality
6715109 i wanted to compare apples to apples and i found that the patients in high spending areas have higher survival rates than the ones in lower spending areas
6715110 typical comparison of a high spending area and a low spending one would represent a 50 difference in healthcare spending intensity such a disparity is associated with a 1 5 percentage point lower mortality rate among heart related emergency patients compared to a mortality of 6
6715111 i found that among local populations going to a teaching hospital was not associated with mortality possibly because these hospitals tend to treat sicker people however among tourists in an emergency situation going to a teaching hospital resulted in lower mortality
6715112 it looks like spending has an impact in terms of saving lives in emergency situations
6715113 there is a presumption that much of our healthcare spending is wasted
6715114 but high levels of spending may be justified because it also seems to increase survival rates in emergency situations
6715115 the effect on grapefruit juice on some medicines is well established and where this applies it is clearly detailed in patient information leaflets pharmacists will usually draw this matter to patients attention when dispensing their medicines this new research showing that apple and orange juice may enhance or reduce the effects of some medicines is interesting but it is only one study usually further research is needed to establish that these interactions are significant
6715116 we would recommend that anybody who is having side effects or has concerns about their medicines asks their pharmacist for advice
6715117 draeger is now offering the same quality of anesthesia delivery in the mri suite as it provides in the most demanding or environment
6715118 we now offer an icu quality ventilator in an mri setting as well as a broad platform of anesthesia machines that are appropriate for any acuity situation we are pleased to be able to offer our customers and their patients the highest quality of care wherever they are receiving anesthesia
6715119 with nearly half of all infants in north america being delivered by caesarean section or after episiotomy there is clearly a requirement for pain relief for mothers
6715120 however our study confirms that codeine as a treatment for pain may be unsuitable and cannot be considered safe for all breastfed infants
6715121 the good news is that those breastfeeding children who were exposed to these high levels of morphine showed dramatic improvement once they were taken off the morphine tainted breast milk
6715122 by removing the exposure most children will demonstrate a complete reversal of symptoms and show no long term adverse effects
6715123 in phase 2 clinical trials telaprevir based regimens have demonstrated the potential to increase sustained viral response rates across a broad spectrum of patients infected with the hepatitis c virus including patients who failed to achieve svr with previous pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy many of whom are at high risk for life threatening hcv related complications
6715124 the realize trial of telaprevir is a landmark phase 3 trial of an investigational hcv protease inhibitor in null responder and other patients who failed prior treatment and will seek to generate additional data to demonstrate the benefit of telaprevir in this difficult to treat patient population
6715125 approximately 6 million patients are chronically infected with hepatitis c in the u s and e u today and approximately 650 000 of these patients have failed previous treatments of pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy and are in need of a new therapeutic option to treat their disease
6715126 data generated from this phase 3 trial in treatment failure patients as well as data from the ongoing phase 3 advance trial in treatment na ve patients may further contribute to the emerging profile of telaprevir to address the significant medical need in both treatment na ve and treatment failure patients
6715127 for public health reasons we remain concerned about the abuse of prescription drugs and any associated addiction overdose or deaths
6715128 our goals are to encourage physicians to treat legitimate chronic pain and to discourage recreational drug abuse i believe this updated analysis provides further evidence of the potential for remoxy to achieve these goals
6715129 the results of these studies further substantiate remoxys potential as a useful solution that may offer a new standard in chronic pain management
6715130 king is committed to developing uniquely designed medicines such as remoxy that not only meet the needs of chronic pain patients but also help address the problem of prescription drug abuse and misuse including use with alcohol which is currently threatening our communities
6715131 mind you plants cant run away from bugs and other pests they need to deal with them one of the things they do is to release volatile substances into the air so as to attract predators of the bugs
6715132 genetic engineering modification gm of green leaf volatile production holds significant potential towards formulating environmentally friendly pest control strategies it also has important implications for manipulating food flavor
6715133 for example the aroma of virgin olive oil stems from the volatiles synthesized by olives by modifying the activity of enzymes that generate these substances it may be possible to alter the flavor of the resulting oils
6715134 our work shows how you can convert one enzyme to another and more importantly provides the needed information for modifying the glv production in plants
6715135 a notable strength of this manuscript is the combined use of structural and evolutionary biology to draw new insights regarding enzyme function these insights led to the striking demonstration that a single amino acid substitution converts one enzyme into another thereby showing how a single point mutation can contribute to the evolution of different biosynthetic pathways this begins to answer the long standing question as to how the same starting molecule can be converted into different products by enzymes that look strikingly similar
6715136 we have discovered that they are also present in marine animals such as sea anemone and corals however we do not know what they do in these organisms
6715137 structural insights into the evolutionary paths of oxylipin biosynthetic enzymes
6715138 it was so important to me to get my dog back and i was so thankful
6715139 i was really happy to see veterinarians come to new orleans it really helps every convention that comes helps a little bit i never knew that there were so many animal lovers in the world
6715140 it was a wonderful program run by the foundation the improvements made to these facilities were immense but i still believe that the people that got the most of out it were the volunteers themselves they really enjoyed contributing their time and the efforts to help rebuild new orleans
6715141 we were able to complete more work than we expected and the facilities looked so much better when we were finished
6715142 the american veterinary medical association generated over 9 million in economic impact by bringing their annual convention to new orleans in the off peak summer months which not only fueled our citys most important economic engine tourism but also supported our chefs street performers musicians artists etc that make new orleans the unique destination that it is
6715143 above and beyond avma donated their time to assist in building new homes for our animal community we cant wait to welcome them back
6715144 people loved the cajun food in wonderful restaurants and they had to be surprised at seeing no effects from katrina in the downtown area

6715146 this is the third court in five years to find that the state of california has put at risk the access to health care for millions of californians by underfunding the medi cal program
6715147 hopefully lawmakers get the message that they cannot balance the budget on the backs of the states poor or those who provide their health care the state safety net needs to be strengthened not weakened
6715148 this decision is a critical step towards ensuring sufficient funding for medi cal but we still have a ways to go
6715149 california still ranks among the lowest states in the country on medi cal rates often reimbursing less than the cost of providing care
6715150 the over expression of mir 21 is observed in a variety of cancers including glioblastoma breast lung colon and others in this study we were able to identify genes affected by levels of mir 21 over expression further our studies show that blocking mir 21 function disrupted many of the pathways critical for tumor invasiveness and proliferation
6715151 this new research adds to a rapidly growing body of evidence suggesting that inhibiting the function of a single microrna could have a profound effect on multiple disease causing proteins thereby interfering with entire cellular pathways and defining a new therapeutic approach for treatment of disease
6715152 our initial experience in working with omnicomm was very favorable and as a result we chose to use them in our next trial we were impressed with their responsiveness and professionalism throughout the entire negotiation and study build process
6715153 research organizations are looking at edc as a strategic imperative to help maximize their investments in todays highly competitive clinical research environment
6715154 omnicomm is privileged to be partnering with companies like sml that are delivering cutting edge cancer treatments to the marketplace it gives us great satisfaction to know that our trialmaster edc solution helps to speed up that process

6715298 these rat model tumours were developed from human glioblastoma tumour cells and closely mimic human tumours in growth patterns and response to therapy

6715329 as we were going back home after things calmed down we could see the damage to the shops and cars and i thought well never have another carnival again
6715330 i enjoyed the carnival in the 80s it was a good decade the carnival got a lot of respect
6715331 there was panorama the carnival was special and more professional and the second generation were interested
6715332 with the unrest in the 1980s there was a mild air of racism and as a black child i felt we were fitting in and being accepted even if it was for two days

6715336 from 2000 the police began controlling the carnival because of gang culture and terrorism

6715511 pensions have been revamped during the last decade by the government to encourage people to save for retirement but this has fallen on deaf ears in too many cases

6715566 you should also note there is nothing wrong with subjective metrics why cant your team score itself 1 to 10 on team performance every month or even better ask your clients amp stakeholders to rate your performance then at least you have a metric that is very difficult to manipulate so what if its not scientific science is not a panacea if the goal is to get a sense of how youre doing and focus team energy qualitative measures can be just as effective as quantitative ones rmpt can work fine with subjective measures

6715580 if home prices were going up and you could hold on to a house for a long time you might be able to make a case that its a better time to buy
6715581 but if you have the ability to rent for half the price without the liabilities that go with owning its a smarter decision to rent
6715582 people feel nervous about trying to time the bottom of the housing market but they dont need to feel that urgency
6715583 a year from now they can come back to the market and theyre not going to lose anything
6715584 if you think youre at all in harms way you shouldnt be in the second home market
6715585 it doesnt matter how affordable a house is if you dont have any income
6715586 i dont think the market will turn around quickly there are probably great deals on yachts right now too but not everybody can buy them
6715587 with values declining its difficult for many to make the leap and purchase a property with the concern that they will lose equity
6715588 but at the same time the suburban product whether its single family homes or condos are at price points where its difficult to construct them at those levels
6715589 it makes no fiscal sense whatsoever to buy a second home it barely makes fiscal sense to buy a first home
6715590 if you rent you know what the costs are if something breaks its somebody elses headache its a vacation
6715591 through the first half of august preliminary numbers indicate that demand room nights sold is down room revenue growth is slowing and supply growth continues
6715592 overall a weak result but better than we would have expected given the difficult comparisons to last year and augusts leisure orientation
6715593 could begin to deteriorate later this year and into 2009 as operators attempt to build a base of occupancy in a weak demand environment
6715594 the bottom line is that there is no evidence from this work the largest study published to date that the cholesterol lowering ability of statins increases the risk of cancer
6715595 lack an effect on cancer risk across all levels of on treatment ldl cholesterol
6715596 the so called j shaped curve has been seen repeatedly when cholesterol has been measured
6715597 in such studies persons with the lowest ldl cholesterol on entry show the highest death rate from cancer than those with higher ldl levels
6715598 this is especially true of cancers involving the blood cell system but it also occurs with cancer of the kidney and elsewhere
6715599 whatever the mechanism the main point should be that studies of much larger numbers of people in statin trials find no excess of cancers
6715600 we need to do a much better job of keeping track of these relationships
6715601 in major trials of statins some do not even report on the number of cancers we need a lot more research in this area in terms of biology virtually nothing is known
6715602 what we need is patient level data to see whether a pattern emerges of different risks at different ldl levels
6715603 but when we give medications to millions we need information about risks versus benefits
6715604 there are some question marks and they may change the risk benefit ratio for some patients
6715605 polling is on the 26th and the year is 2008
6715606 if you add two and six it equals eight the two in the beginning of 2008 is perceived as going towards the number eight which is at the end so there are two eights derived from the two dates and ill enter the polling station at 8am the third eight

6715635 the magnitude of the improvement has been a little bit of a surprise
6715636 theyve broken through in some sports that we thought it would be very hard for them to win medals in
6715637 we better learn how to develop real teams in ping pong and badminton and some other sports where they dominate
6715638 they didnt know what the sport was 10 years ago
6715639 theyre taking it out of the hides of the rest of the world
6715640 in 10 years we have achieved what european and north american countries worked on for 40 to 50 years
6715641 its not as relaxed or as easy as you think
6715642 actually we worked very hard and trained very hard every day we train from morning to night
6715643 it got me so worked up so i guess this method worked
6715644 the thing i think you can see in the faces of chinese athletes is theyre having fun out there
6715645 if they break through in those medal opportunities in track and field and swimming where weve traditionally been dominant and relied on them for 50 to 60 of the medals for the united states team then well have a much more difficult time obviously to maintain the total medal count

6715657 all of us in the simmons community are delighted that year after year our excellence continues to be recognized by one of the nations best known college guidebooks
6715658 however our admissions officers always tell prospective students that they should select a college that best suits their needs not by its position in a ranking
6715659 generally students dont make decisions on where to enroll for four years on a ranking its all about the individual experience

6715663 to miss the election of my lifetime with the candidate of my lifetime would be very painful for me
6715664 i know what this woman can do ive seen her do it
6715665 hillary gets the respect and the attention that the campaign deserves and that people see that she is sincere in her support for sen obama
6715666 show the country that in fact he can lead and can bring people together
6715667 he is not intimidated by other strong leaders in the party
6715668 i think that this is a great opportunity for sen
6715669 felt strongly about sen clinton and thought that she would be a great candidate
6715670 i think she really understood a lot of the issues
6715671 obama won the delegates needed to be the nominee and im certainly going to support him when he gets the nomination
6715672 i think weve all got to come together and really support the candidate in november
6715673 have a clear message for what we want to bring forward
6715674 clearly define why sen obama is the better candidate for this time
6715675 going to be the candidate most likely to win and to bring about significant change in this country
6715676 i think that when you consider that obama was virtually unknown and his principal opponent was extremely well known i have to say im very satisfied
6715677 i was really elated at how far we came in such a short time
6715678 leave denver and the convention genuinely united behind barack obama
6715679 i dont know anything that could be of greater importance to me right now in addition to being united inspired to work as hard as we can to make sure he does get elected
6715680 a play within the play in denver to show the democrats they chose the wrong savior
6715681 to honor her work that she did in the campaign and all the work that people put in on her behalf
6715682 not a majority obviously but certainly a very high percentage of the delegates will be clinton delegates technically
6715683 i can remember in 1972 when the democratic nomination was not even settled on the first ballot
6715684 i thought it was quite fun and i dont see that theres any harm in it
6715685 a call for universal health care that is truly universal
6715686 demeaning portrayals of women dampen the dreams of our daughters
6715687 obama does not use lesbian and gay with great frequency
6715688 it would be if we had a candidate who was reluctant to mention those words but i think barack obama has been very good about making sure they do get mentioned on a regular basis
6715689 scorned our gay brothers and sisters instead of embracing them
6715690 how we will organize how we will effectively turn out the vote what language we will use to marshal our community
6715691 to force obama to be more forthright in addressing gay and lesbian issues
6715692 it is in my opinion a serious continuing problem for the gay community and i dont think weve fully adequately mobilized ourselves to deal with it
6715693 if you have never wept bitter tears because a wonderful story has come to an end and you must take your leave of the characters with whom you have shared so many adventures whom you have loved and admired for whom you have hoped and feared and without whose company life seems empty and meaningless if such things have not been part of your own experience you probably wont understand what bastian did next

6715705 with nearly half of all infants in north america being delivered by caesarean section or after episiotomy there is clearly a requirement for pain relief for mothers
6715706 however our study confirms that codeine as a treatment for pain may be unsuitable and cannot be considered safe for all breastfed infants

6715733 chi diffonde i file sostiene che non ci siano effetti collaterali che le dosi provocano delle semplici sbornie ma bene che a stabilirlo siano i medici
6715734 l i doser potrebbe diventare un nuovo fenomeno sociale ora non siamo in grado di dire quali ripercussioni possa avere su chi ne fa uso ma se dovesse avere gli effetti degli stupefacenti la cosa potrebbe diventare pericolosa e allora necessario il coinvolgimento di tutte le realt competenti dai ricercatori agli psicologi

6715747 this crack is moving and moving closer and closer to the front its just a matter of time till a much larger piece is going to break off it is imminent
6715748 as we see this phenomenon occurring further and further north and petermann is as far north as you can get it certainly adds to the concern
6715749 its a signal but we dont know what it means
6715750 the crack is not alarming i would say it is normal

6715773 there was no sound system just steel band and masquerades
6715774 rhonda started dancing when she was just two and from 1974 i had a section in the band and costumes
6715775 i saw police bottles being pelted and cars turned over and burnt
6715776 as we were going back home after things calmed down we could see the damage to the shops and cars and i thought well never have another carnival again
6715777 i enjoyed the carnival in the 80s it was a good decade the carnival got a lot of respect
6715778 there was panorama the carnival was special and more professional and the second generation were interested
6715779 with the unrest in the 1980s there was a mild air of racism and as a black child i felt we were fitting in and being accepted even if it was for two days
6715780 the greater london council was involved and funding came in and the event became high profile and attracted big crowds
6715781 troublemakers started coming in and the media reported muggings and violence and the climate changed
6715782 its sad because the troublemakers are spoiling something their forefathers created
6715783 from 2000 the police began controlling the carnival because of gang culture and terrorism
6715784 now you dont have the carnival spirit there are a lot of restrictions and even though there are more police i dont feel safe
6715785 in the 1980s there was a lot more community spirit even among bands now it feels like a military parade you want to get on and off as soon as possible
6715786 i like dancing to the music and going on the stage and dancing in front of a lot of people
6715787 community based bands like ours rely heavily on fund raising and in the past five years we are finding it harder to raise money
6715788 this year we have had to compromise instead of the usual 12 big costumes we just will have just four or five with very basic material
6715789 they choose a piece of river to tackle move in restore it and move on to the next bit
6715790 when the olympic torch ran in london mr prime minister you personally welcomed the torch and you also expressed support for the beijing olympic games for which we would like to express our appreciation and gratitude
6715791 it is in chinas interest it would be a very important gesture to the rest of the world if they were to say that these restrictions could be permanently removed
6715792 i think there is more common ground between the chinese authorities and tibet than is sometimes realised
6715793 he responded by saying that these are issues that will be part of our continuing discussions
6715794 with the whole world watching the olympic games have captured the imagination of the whole global community
6715795 the 2008 beijing olympics have set a new standard for the olympic games which we in london in 2012 will seek to follow

6715815 it came about in 1994 when kurt cobain barely 27 shot himself in the head his body pumped full of heroin and valium
6715816 but we spend an awful lot of our twenties defining ourselves with our jobs with our relationships when we reach 27 weve been trying so hard to reach certain goals fame money success that we might suddenly realise for the first time that were not that happy after all and we are supposed to be grown up and responsible and we dont feel ready
6715817 its nothing like what it seems lisa this doesnt have to affect our arrangement

6715822 she is really too trusting next the hardware store and tonight that spitfire bar owner
6715823 no no he was just thinking about that a morning without bobs wry wisecracks
6715824 he was too excited about his new store in fact today was supposed to be his grand opening

6715826 myspace page so head over now to check it out the band recently shot a new video for the track with acclaimed director theory of a deadman expect the clip to premiere next month
6715827 this tour has just started and already the chaos has begun
6715828 we ended up making it to montreal just in time for our video shoot for
6715829 after that we headed off to the first show of the summer slaughter tour in quebec city regardless of the insanity of nine different bands with too much gear the show went off with out a hitch and i think everyone had a killer time thanks to all our fans that came out and showed support its already apparent that all the bands are wicked cool and that this will be a killer tour were looking forward to the rest of the shows
6715830 unless they are annoying flower vendors in this case they should rott in the sixth circle of hell
6715831 this weekend the video is the first from the bands new album trustkill records
6715832 we wanted something simple and performance driven but with lots of pyro just fire everywhere
6715833 and by all accounts that is exactly what we will be getting this weekend
6715834 were looking at budget cuts next year 75 to 120 million if we could offset some or all of the cost of our fuel increase with something like this thats hard not to look at
6715835 were going to look at obvious alternatives natural gas propane anything else that might come along hybrid is something we may see here very soon

6715839 i want the public to have confidence in our ability to deal with these sort of viruses when they happen
6715840 protect lives and the dignity of russian citizens wherever they are
6715841 on this issue of south ossetia and georgia we fully support russia the americans continue their cold war policies the war which was unleashed by georgia is the culmination of attempts to encircle and isolate russia
6715842 georgia started the crisis but the west is blaming russia everywhere there is total disinformation distortion of facts and international attempts to isolate russia
6715843 the caucasus and europe are impossible without russia i think that after the crisis with georgia russia has become only stronger
6715844 it is important that russia takes the position of a superpower and then all the attempts to isolate it will fail
6715845 our position is that we are ready to cooperate with russia in any project that can strengthen its security
6715846 in principle yes we have not yet thought about it
6715847 eighty types of military vehicles explosives landmines and special explosives for the clearing minefields
6715848 i think that in russia and in the world everyone is now aware of israels role and its military consultants in the georgia crisis before there were people in russia who thought these forces could be friendly now i think no one thinks that way
6715849 bring the syrians and israelis into one room and sit with them for the sake of peace
6715850 we are going to help rebuild georgia into a strong georgian state the russians will have failed in their effort to undermine georgia

6715874 we are excited to launch this highly differentiating new suite of advanced voice services

6715888 always said russia was more scary than the united states
6715889 they have to think what kind of precedent the russians are setting
6715890 i dont think russia benefits from instability on the korean peninsula or further north korean proliferation
6715891 from the mid 1990s to today nuclear diplomacy was the key
6715892 is to improve war preparedness through military cooperation between south korea and the us
6715893 if a war possibly breaks out we should be fully prepared to terminate it in a single day

6715953 were trying to make the supply chain into a growth engine for the company
6715954 a lot of the time supply chain management is reactive or passive cost control but we think theres also an opportunity for us to have the supply chain create top line growth as well as bottom line performance
6715955 if i do something with my supply chain to reduce my customers inventories i want more than just the supplier of the year plaque

6716002 it is a welcome decision however iptv is not a mature technology as yet you can not define iptv as a mass media it will have a niche competition but we do not see it replacing cable system in near future
6716003 it shows that government is getting serious about the iptv there are only a couple of issues that ministry of information and broadcasting has to look into like private terrestrial guidelines standardisation and must carry clause
6716004 iptv is so called niche market but actually for the common man as it is on broadband which is accepted as a basic need once broadband is rolled out iptv will ride on it the actual competition will be in dth players now

6716037 it is still uncertain whether russians planned withdrawal is going ahead today or not
6716038 this is definitely a new phenomenon that we are witnessing it shows a commitment by these countries to take action to prevent convicted child sex offenders from entering their borders
6716039 this is the result of information being shared by various authorities
6716040 it is believed that southeast asia attracts the highest number of traveling sex offenders and child sex tourists
6716041 most of the child sex offenders are locals although foreign exploiters are often in the media
6716042 most of these cases are settled out of court within the communities where there is a transfer of funds as compensation for the family of the victims the case is closed but the abuser remains free
6716043 it is thought that nine out of 10 customers of child prostitutes are filipinos
6716044 on the indonesian island of batam singaporean tourists underpin the demand for underage sex likewise chinese and thai tourists are going to the shan state in myanmar to take advantage of child sex workers

6716096 either alone or in combination with caffeine and other stimulants for purposes of weight loss body building or increased energy
6716097 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6716098 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6716099 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6716100 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6716101 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6716102 we have no savings so we have nothing left during emergencies
6716103 i have lost my wifes gold which i gave as security to a moneylender and could not repay
6716104 once i even rented my cooking gas cylinder to arrange some money for a health emergency suffered by my wife the situation is similar for all of us one of my friends even sold his blood to get some extra money to meet an emergency
6716105 once the hip flagbearer of high tech is in sad decline
6716106 but this time apple has lost something its unlikely to win back the technology leadership that made the macintosh so different from other computers
6716107 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6716108 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6716109 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6716110 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6716111 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6716112 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6716113 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6716114 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6716115 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6716116 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6716117 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6716118 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6716119 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6716120 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6716121 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6716122 le d crochage des valeurs li es au prix des mati res premi res nous para t excessif
6716123 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6716124 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6716125 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6716126 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6716127 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6716128 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6716129 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6716130 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6716131 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6716132 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6716133 i belive in you like you have no idea i know that you are the person in which
6716134 one cannot obviously time the markets to perfection and markets would not wait for news to come they would front run the news and hence bad days are good days for investing our sense is that around the levels the market bottomed out earlier should be a good bottom to look at in case people do want to put in large amounts of money we are very positive on long term growth oriented sectors like infrastructure capital goods engineering once interest rates start showing some signs of moderating we would be very happy to look at banks selectively pharma and fmcg are areas one should focus on
6716135 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6716136 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6716137 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6716138 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6716139 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6716140 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6716141 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that

6716143 who are open to doing something on the production side
6716144 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6716145 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans

6716147 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6716148 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6716149 we are pleased to see the data from this study support earlier published data on the use of the immuknow assay in monitoring adult patients after a renal transplant
6716150 clearly there is further research needed to elucidate the appropriate standards for use of cell mediated immunity to monitor risk for infection and rejection in selected patient categories however this publication further illustrates the potential risks for infection associated with over immunosuppression in renal transplant patients and the potential value of the immuknow assay in monitoring immune status
6716151 we were thinking that by putting the strategy in place that we would have to leave some magazines for a number of years before making the change but we were able to work with magazines much earlier than we expected ostrom said

6716156 unfortunately we havent had both cars scoring points and in the last two races they toyota have
6716157 and thats something which even if david coulthard and i start doing now which is going to be tough for us to do we are still 10 points adrift so it will take a while to recover that
6716158 you could launch a load of development into this years car and push and then get ripped off by a safety car in singapore and lose all that again or you might gain it the other way
6716159 it is still 12 of one and half a dozen of the other
6716160 we were always under pressure to hold fourth and they toyota were always never far from us
6716161 in phase 2 clinical trials telaprevir based regimens have demonstrated the potential to increase sustained viral response rates across a broad spectrum of patients infected with the hepatitis c virus including patients who failed to achieve svr with previous pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy many of whom are at high risk for life threatening hcv related complications
6716162 the realize trial of telaprevir is a landmark phase 3 trial of an investigational hcv protease inhibitor in null responder and other patients who failed prior treatment and will seek to generate additional data to demonstrate the benefit of telaprevir in this difficult to treat patient population
6716163 approximately 6 million patients are chronically infected with hepatitis c in the u s and e u today and approximately 650 000 of these patients have failed previous treatments of pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy and are in need of a new therapeutic option to treat their disease
6716164 data generated from this phase 3 trial in treatment failure patients as well as data from the ongoing phase 3 advance trial in treatment na ve patients may further contribute to the emerging profile of telaprevir to address the significant medical need in both treatment na ve and treatment failure patients
6716165 our results show that hot flushes night sweats sleeplessness and joint pains were less common in women on hrt in this age group sexuality was also improved
6716166 overall quality of life measures improved even when women did not have hot flushes and were well past menopause there was a small but measurable improvement in quality of life and a noted improvement in sleep sexuality and joint pains hrt users also had more breast tenderness and discharge compared to those on a placebo
6716167 these new data should be added to the risk benefit equation for hrt the quality of life benefits of hrt may be greater in women with more severe symptoms near menopause new research suggests that hrt taken from near menopause avoids the cardiovascular risks seen when hrt is initiated many years after menopause
6716168 enable the risks of hrt to be reduced and its benefits maximized when the treatment is individualized to each woman
6716169 early start up side effects can usually be alleviated by adjusting the treatment
6716170 for most women with significant menopause symptoms the benefits of hrt outweigh the risks
6716171 if a woman feels that hrt is needed for quality of life then doctors can find the safest regimen for her she can try going off hrt every 4 5 years and can then make an informed choice about whether she takes and continues hrt
6716172 i have not got much experience of driving a wrc car but i know both events quite well

6716174 i have heard little bits about the new coach thinking of asking me but i havent spoken to him
6716175 a couple of years ago i did think about coming out of international retirement
6716176 when steve was appointed he rang and asked me to return just the fact the england manager had rung and asked me to come back and play for my country meant a lot to me
6716177 i did think about it but i dont really think i was ever that close that i would have said yes it wasnt about not thinking it was too much or i wasnt capable it was just the fact that when i was playing i wasnt enjoying it one little bit
6716178 so i thought the time was right to get out and i finally decided it wasnt right to go back into it all again
6716179 francois was due to drive a focus rs wrc for the stobart team in spain and corsica

6716181 a third consecutive manufacturers world title is our aim this season and francois experience of these two specialised rallies will maximise our chances of obtaining strong results

6716189 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6716190 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6716191 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6716192 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6716193 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6716194 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6716195 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6716196 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6716197 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6716198 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

6716202 this is the fourth report on cancer survival in australia in 23 years with improvements each time and an overall increase in five year survival of around 30 per cent
6716203 sixty four per cent of australian women and 58 per cent of men are now alive five years after a cancer diagnosis compared with 53 and 41 per cent respectively between 1982 and 1986 with particularly good results for patients aged between 50 and 70
6716204 the findings reflect the effectiveness of early detection and advances in chemotherapy radiation therapy and surgery which are extending the lives of people diagnosed with a range of cancers
6716205 with 655 000 australians either living with an invasive cancer or as a long term cancer survivor we have to pull together as a community to support individuals and their families through the many difficulties of a cancer diagnosis
6716206 the new data also show that we have made very limited progress in treating some complex and aggressive tumours such as those of the lung brain pancreas and cancers of unknown primary source underscoring the need for more research
6716207 adding urgency to the need for programs and services that reduce social inequity in cancer care outcomes
6716208 isolated just one milligram a very tiny amount from natural sources that were very difficult to grow
6716209 we needed to develop a concise and efficient synthetic route to make enough largazole for animal studies

6716211 it could be a very good drug candidate for the treatment of various cancers
6716212 our findings may someday allow doctors to screen for and diagnose skin cancers at very early stages
6716213 chemical biomarkers may eventually serve as objective clinical markers of disease if effective sensor technology can be developed

6716215 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6716216 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6716217 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6716218 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6716219 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6716220 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6716221 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6716222 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6716223 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6716224 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6716225 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6716226 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6716227 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6716228 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6716229 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6716230 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6716231 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6716232 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6716233 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6716234 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

6716240 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6716241 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6716242 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6716243 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6716244 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6716245 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6716246 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

6716252 its a great time to be a young black law school graduate if youre from harvard and in the top quarter of your class
6716253 but the point is that there are a lot of talented young minorities who may not have been able to go to the top schools for example a lot of minorities go to state schools due to financial constraints
6716254 until the minorities who are going to the good but not the most prestigious schools those who are doing a good job who are highly competent and have the intelligence and the energy to do terrific work until those people are looked at and hired in significant numbers i think you are going to continue to have serious recruitment and retention problems
6716255 certainly a lot of large frims are interested in hiring more minorities

6716299 he did it two days in a row it was something he had to really dig deep for because it wasnt in character he was a shy guy a very quiet guy to do that he really did feel the emotion that was probably the greatest sendoff for an athlete ive ever seen

6716330 me lo tomar con tranquilidad pero tambi n estoy animada para empezar a trabajar en el quinto lbum
6716331 todo el mundo pregunta si ser la pr xima o si estoy tratando de tener un hijo odio decepcionar a la gente pero la respuesta es no
6716332 we want to inform you that obama for america inc which is the principal campaign committee for senator barack obama in his campaign for president of the united states as the democratic national committee are in no way affiliated with this event or with this organisation
6716333 is to corrupt obamas campaign as they corrupted nigerias system with nebulous corporate nigeria
6716334 it is good to denounce them for the us system frowns at such dubious fund she thought it was a do or die political culture
6716335 prosecute prof ndidi okereke onyiuke and her cohorts for corrupting the nigerian electoral system through a nebulous association called corporate nigeria
6716336 it is a crime against the nation which they nearly exported overseas
6716337 the american law restricts such fundraising for a campaign group that is opposed to another from an external organisation somebody that is connected to an establishment like the nse cannot just venture into such things
6716338 the group and their leader have defrauded innocent citizens and organisations an act popularly known as 419 security agents should arrest her immediately and charge her to court because she has tarnished the countrys image
6716339 that would be sort of like putting the defendant in a candy store
6716340 ive been around animals my whole life and never had an incident
6716341 i can tell you from experience the tears i cried over a 5 foot water monitor were every bit as hard as the one i cried over a 125 pound rottweiler scales fur and feathers it all hurts just the same when your pet dies
6716342 ethel especially loved strawberries which we found hilarious because her hips would get red and it looked like she was wearing lipstick
6716343 if theres nothing around no traffic it doesnt faze me
6716344 its a victimless crime when youre riding a long distance stopping and starting all the time just adds to your fatigue
6716345 were going to be enforcing the same traffic laws for bikes as well as motorists so that both respect each other and the rules of the road as far as bike safety and motor safety
6716346 but were not out here to punish people were out here to change habits
6716347 most people we talk to say that rolling through a stop sign or a light is not that important compared to other things going on
6716348 follow 90 percent of the rules and for the 10 percent youre breaking know that youre breaking them and look at what the safety issue is
6716349 if the goal is to have fewer people going to the hospital or the morgue because of transportation collisions the biggest win is cracking down on bad motorist behavior not bad cyclist behavior

6716353 until the killers of mr ogundeji and their sponsors are brought to book
6716354 we are left wondering whether this is a deliberate case of cover up or a case of incompetence

6716359 the applicant has also informed me and i verily believe that he is seeking to join this proceedings as a plaintiff in order to amongst other things uphold the solemn oath he took as a member of the national assembly to uphold the requirements of the constitution and also fulfill his pledge to ensure compliance with the resolution on the treaty passed by the house of representatives

6716371 minggu minggu ini kita akan keluarkan sk mengenai perilaku pialang berjangka diantaranya mengatur pekerja asing perusahaan pialang berjangka soal rekruitmen tenaga marketing pemuatan iklan lowongan kerja
6716372 korban sistem perdagangan ini karena tidak ketahuan dengan memasang iklan dengan lowongan kerja disuruh datang wawancara lalu misalnya diterima sebagai bisnis konsultan diberikan kartu nama maka orang akan senang dengan bangga memberi tahu ke pacarnya kalau dia sudah kerja
6716373 kalau mereka sudah masuk direkrut mereka korban bilang dengan ayahnya bagi pialang yang nakal sebagai kesempatan untuk melakukan transaksi benaran mencari bantuan dari orang tuanya dalam sekejab akan hilang uang itu
6716374 memang kalau diiklan lowongan kerjanya tidak akan ketahuan tapi kalau korban itu mengadu maka kita bisa tahu kalau sudah diperingatkan masih tetap dilakukan akan sanki pecabutan kalau pidana kita bawa ke pengadilan

6716378 i find it a bit rich sir clive woodward taking on the lead role for elite performance
6716379 i found myself imbibing a mojito or two beside him in antigua last year during the cricket world cup and i think its fair to say the man is not averse to the odd pie or fifteen i just hope he isnt advocating his own dietary regime to our elite athletes
6716380 modern pentathlon comprises fencing shooting swimming show jumping and cross country running
6716381 why is it a good thing that our boy aaron cook has to fight a guy who just beat the crap out of the reigning double olympic champion surely the italian sarmiento is going to be hard as nails no
6716382 why when i was just looking forward to sitting down and reading your blog about aaron cook did you decide to supply it on a web page that my company feels is an un acceptable address
6716383 regarding the taekwondo does cook get a bronze regardless because he made the semis like the boxers
6716384 i am rather hoping to see a no holds barred attempt to beat all the records at the conventional games that man with the carbon fibre legs versus name removed by spineless reporter fearful of guardian legal department and his her cocktail of drugs perhaps competing against someone who has been genetically modified with cheetah implants and someone else with prototype wallace n gromit rocket legs that may or may not explode on the start line original guaranteed records and best of all no one could cheat wouldnt that be more fun
6716385 in this olympic games the netherlands team is doing pretty well so far 15 medals including 6 golds but the story that theyre all rather smugly enjoying is this
6716386 here in hong kong were right slap bang in the middle of the eye of typhoon nuri
6716387 its totally calm the dragonflies have come out as has next doors maid within half an hour itll be like armageddon
6716388 in the diving tom daley has it easy as its really just jumping into water isnt it
6716389 most other jumping events long jump ski jump etc use length or length plus style marks as the criteria for victory so why not in the pool seeing someone charge along the 10 metre platform then jump as far out as possible into the water would be great fun style marks could be awarded for tightest bomb or best use of flailing limbs
6716390 surely james degale is a shoo in for sports personality if the beeb can take the personality aspect of the award into account
6716391 did james degale really declare that he trained for four years and then fought his way to the final of an olympic boxing tournament because
6716392 surely there is an easier way just buy the cd for gods sake man
6716393 thats the way he plays hes a runner im a fighter
6716394 im not a sore loser i hope he goes on a wins gold
6716395 i just wanna hear my national anthem ill cry i swear
6716396 its like the bull and the matador at the moment all degale needs is a cape
6716397 having listened to the jamaican national anthem a few times recently does anybody else think it should be a bit more fun
6716398 why is the british diver tom daley allowed to compete at 14 but not the gymnasts
6716399 tell harry that mines a gin and tonic and im happy to call it a draw for the sake of international relations
6716400 ill buy pommiebarsteward one if he cares to join me
6716401 golds gb has 17 and oz and nz combined have 14 pommie may say that 14 is nowhere near 17 but most wouldnt but the combined populations of the three countries less than 30 million are nowhere near the 60 million gb has team gb need to be on 28 golds to even equal the efforts of the tri nations
6716402 if harry would care to calculate the gold medal totals of aus nz and ireland and lump them all together hell find it still doesnt come close to gb and id like to paraphrase that great icon of irish australian culture at its best paul hogan as crocodile dundee
6716403 here in perth its quite hard to find out exactly what team gb is winning because the aussie tv broadcasters dont show any of it theyve given us barely a minute of the track cycling every brits new favourite sport choosing instead to show anything with the slightest flash of green and gold thankfully a medal table is never far away though which is pretty satisfying
6716404 team gb are at liberty to send 482 competitors if they wish australia cannot find another 40 million population to pick from as an irish kiwi id like to paraphrase henry kissinger and wish you would both lose
6716405 gb has 311 odd athletes in beijing while australia has over 482 does harry care to work out the medal winning ratio on that basis can i hear the sound of a pin dropping
6716406 the philippines have never won gold their best is two silvers in boxing
6716407 surely with a comparable gdp but three times the population of australia anything less than three times the medals means oz wins i mean apples with apples please
6716408 does any one know what the chances are of the russians passing us in the medal table if we finish third it would be great but a fourth would still be creditable personally speaking as long we finish above the aussies ill be more than happy
6716409 oh i ran 1500 meters in searing heat and breath sapping humidity you
6716410 ive noticed the guardians medal table still has australia on 36 in total this needs to be updated to 38

6716418 de commissie is positief over de programmering van sonic acts en zijn positionering in het festivallandschap de commissie steunt de voornemens om meer aandacht te geven aan publiekswerving en het archief toegankelijk te maken ook het vergroten van de eigen inkomsten vindt zij van groot belang
6716419 de commissie is positief over motel moza que dat door zijn interdisciplinaire programmering en vorm een voorbeeldfunctie voor andere festivals vervult zij vindt mm een verrijking voor het bestaande culturele aanbod in nederland op grond van de artistieke kwaliteit en de bijzondere invulling daarvan het brede publieksbereik en de lokale inbedding van het festival in rotterdam adviseert de commissie mm op te nemen in de regeling vierjarige subsidies podiumkunstinstellingen 2009 2012 met een lichte verhoging van de subsidie daarbij beschouwt de commissie de activiteiten die de organisatie door het jaar heen organiseert van onvoldoende belang om voor structurele ondersteuning in aanmerking te komen
6716420 de commissie kent robodock als een festival dat een eigen plaats in het podiumkunstenlandschap inneemt het beleidsplan en de aanvraag richten zich echter primair op het cre ren van een internationaal productiehuis annex laboratorium dat het hele jaar actief is aanvragen voor productiehuizen behoren echter tot de basisinfrastructuur en vallen dus buiten de reikwijdte van het fonds het festival zelf komt in het beleidsplan nauwelijks aan de orde de geschetste artistieke ontwikkeling is onvoldoende en weinig consistent
6716421 op basis van het beleidsplan stelt de commissie vast dat 5 days off met zijn artistieke profiel en programmering onvoldoende meerwaarde heeft ten opzichte van bestaande programmering en festivals daarbij mist ze in het beleidsplan een overtuigende langetermijnvisie op de ontwikkeling van zowel het artistieke als zakelijke beleid
6716422 de commissie is van mening dat rumor in onvoldoende mate voldoet aan de definitie van een festival omdat de programmering van rumor door de kleinschalige opzet in de tijd en het aantal optredens onvoldoende toevoegt aan de reguliere programmering ziet zij op basis van het beleidsplan geen aanleiding om rumor in aanmerking te laten komen voor een vierjarige subsidie
6716423 hoewel de commissie het festival in artistiek opzicht aansprekend vindt is ze van mening dat het hier primair gaat om een regulier project van beide organisatoren dat gevoegd bij de weinig realistische en mager onderbouwde plannen op het gebied van cultureel ondernemerschap en bedrijfsvoering voor de komende periode brengt de commissie tot een negatief oordeel
6716424 de commissie vindt de aanvraag van metropolis onvoldoende duidelijk over de artistieke koers van het festival in de komende jaren zij is van mening dat metropolis in de komende periode eerst moet bewijzen over een meerjarige artistieke visie te beschikken die voorziet in een festival dat in artistiek inhoudelijk opzicht een aanvulling vormt op het bestaande aanbod
6716425 de commissie is van oordeel dat de beoogde uitbreiding van muziekfestival naar een breed kunstenfestival een artistieke visie of onderbouwing ontbeert zodat een interessante toevoeging aan het landelijke aanbod niet kan worden waargemaakt voorts meent de commissie dat de aanvraag een organisatie weerspiegelt die het booming karakter van het festival niet bijbeent
6716426 op grond van het ontbreken van een oorspronkelijk artistiek profiel en duidelijke artistieke selectiecriteria oordeelt de commissie dat het fries productiehuis popcultuur geen meerwaarde biedt ten opzichte van bestaande productiehuizen en onvoldoende bijdraagt aan de ontwikkeling van het genre popmuziek er is volgens de commissie evenmin sprake van een landelijke spreiding van het aanbod
6716427 op grond van de grote ook internationale betekenis van steim voor de ontwikkeling van het genre elektronische muziek is de commissie positief over de aanvraag de commissie verwacht wel van steim dat het de komende periode een grote inspanning zal leveren om het imago en de naamsbekendheid van de instelling significant te verbeteren
6716428 de commissie mist een artistieke visie en artistieke selectiecriteria in de aanvraag van productiehuis west nederland op grond daarvan kent de commissie geen onderscheidende betekenis toe aan het productiehuis iets dat zij noodzakelijk acht voor deze functie
6716429 de commissie oordeelt positief over oerol gezien zijn nog altijd unieke positie in het festivallandschap zijn landelijke uitstraling de brugfunctie die het vervult naar het publiek en de verbinding van disciplines
6716430 crescendo wenst met name in aanmerking te komen voor een structurele subsidie om spinvis daadwerkelijk de rol van artistiek leider te kunnen laten innemen crescendo maakt in zijn aanvraag echter niet inzichtelijk welke positieve resultaten hierdoor zijn te verwachten met betrekking tot de artistieke ontwikkeling en aan welke zaken het behalve geld nu ontbreekt om het gewenste resultaat te behalen ondanks het vertrouwen dat de commissie heeft in de talentvolle maker die door crescendo wordt gefaciliteerd is zij van mening dat crescendo in zijn beleidsplan onvoldoende overtuigend weet te onderbouwen welke artistieke ontwikkeling wordt nagestreefd in de komende periode en in hoeverre deze gebaat is bij structurele subsidie de commissie is van mening dat de weinig inzichtelijke begroting dit oordeel versterkt

6716441 it wouldnt surprise me if it went the same way again both chelsea and manchester united are exceptionally good teams
6716442 the knee injury happened during the first game of pre season i was a bit frustrated because the same thing happened to me last year when i was injured in the pre season as well
6716443 it was a difficult moment for myself but i came through and hopefully now it is all finished and i can have a good season like last year
6716444 in the end it has been one month out it is not that big a problem
6716445 it is better if i compare this years injury with last year when it was my eye and i couldnt do anything for three weeks i was just sitting at home and couldnt even watch the tv
6716446 hopefully now everything is behind me and i will stay injury free all season my fitness level is not a problem but i didnt play any pre season games and that is difficult

6716459 instead of self serving schemes arroyo should address the present economic crisis burdening the people last we checked oil prices are still at record high levels the lines at nfa retail shops are not getting any shorter and the government is earning more windfalls via the vat at the expense of our poor countrymen

6716499 preferisco parlare di confronto il comune avr diritto di decidere deduzioni detrazioni ed esenzioni per esempio potra scegliere se mettere una tassa sul turismo o decidere di esentare gli alberghi per promuovere il settore

6716704 dont be fooled by the inevitable ebbs and flows of the statistics whether one looks at major retailers at the value and luxury ends of the market or in the middle it is crystal clear that everyone is feeling the pinch and no one is immune
6716705 looking forward retailers are having to make careful preparations for the christmas period especially in terms of cash flow forecasting to manage their cost base with the added pressure of new retail spaces opening in major centres such as liverpool cardiff and londons west end retailers are facing further uncertainty as to whether demand will meet supply in the months ahead

6716770 for me his achievement is as valid as phelps or bolt
6716771 i dont like to compare athletes from different sports but ben ainslie competes in a boat class where he can only win one medal
6716772 the others phelps and bolt can win two three all the way up to eight what they do is fantastic but what ainslie does is equally fantastic
6716773 the performance of the british team has not surprised me because i know what they have put in place
6716774 since a few years ago especially after the 1996 atlanta games where it was not so spectacular you have made a very good effort
6716775 you have targeted some sports where you could win more medals which was very wise you have a population of 60 million you cannot compete with mammoths like the us and china
6716776 and you had a lot of lottery funding which has been criticised but the results are there and i think it was worthwhile
6716777 we had a very good example with greece in 2004
6716778 it was a return to the roots to the country that invented the olympics london should be the return to the country which invented modern sport there is fantastic tradition but also the way of life the way you approach and play sport
6716779 and this is going to last for evident reasons the demography is never going to work against china their system allows unlimited resources in terms of people and finance for sport and they are very clever in importing a lot of very knowledgeable foreign trainers
6716780 in the short and mid term the united states will still be dominant in terms of economic power and sport
6716781 they still have the most number of sponsors the revenue generated by sport is mainly us based so that will last for a time but it is not the hegemony we had a few years ago
6716782 the tests we have conducted have been negative and i am very glad about that but time will tell if this is something that will last for the future
6716783 i said we could have 30 or 40 positive tests but if we dont reach that number it will prove the deterrent part of our strategy is working
6716784 woodlands and the open spaces within them have a vital contribution to make towards conserving scotlands threatened habitats and species
6716785 we are very fortunate in scotland to enjoy a wealth of biodiversity that is for the most part robust and healthy
6716786 however some elements are extremely fragile and making sure that they thrive will require some large scale thinking and landscape scale vision both of which are forestry sector strengths

6716802 be the change that i want to see in this world
6716803 six decades after the universal declaration of human rights was adopted it is shocking that there should still be discrimination against those at high risk such stigma attached to individuals living with hiv this not only drives the virus underground where it can spread in the dark as important it is an affront to our common humanity i call for a change in laws that uphold stigma and discrimination including restrictions on travel for people living with hiv emphasis added
6716804 if you are neutral in situations of injustice you have chosen the side of the oppresor
6716805 your time is limited so dont waste it living someone elses life dont be trapped by dogma which is living with the results of other peoples thinking dont let the noise of others opinions drown out your own inner voice and most important have the courage to follow your heart and intuition they somehow already know what you truly want to become everything else is secondary
6716806 anyone can give up its the easiest thing in the world to do but to hold it together when everyone else would understand if you fell apart thats true strength
6716807 if you want work well done select a busy man the other kind has no time
6716808 i am a leader by default only because nature does not allow a vacuum
6716809 creative brains are a valuable limited resource they shouldnt be wasted on re inventing the wheel when there are so many fascinating new problems waiting out there
6716810 whatever the duration of this struggle and whatever the difficulties we will not permit the triumph of violence in the affairs of men free people will set the course of history
6716811 everything you see exists together in a delicate balance as king you need to understand that balance and respect all the creatures from the crawling ant to the leaping antelope
6716812 so far we have confirmed 55 dead people mostly those who were involved in the fighting
6716813 we condemn this genocide and urge the two groups to stop the fighting unconditionally
6716814 we issued a release saying that over 40 olympic athletes downloaded the album in an act of solidarity and thats what triggered it then everything got blocked
6716815 we are aware of the logon problems but we have no comment at the moment
6716816 it seems like suspending itunes is punishment for itunes but really it doesnt hurt itunes it hurts us
6716817 some in beijing did download and i think thats what spooked the
6716818 theyre incredibly supportive people they wouldnt do anything like that
6716819 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one severe and or moderate life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women
6716820 on the other hand a general feeling of happiness and optimism can play a protective role
6716821 emotional stress is highly subjective and is difficult to measure accurately
6716822 women in this study were interviewed after breast cancer was diagnosed when they may be more likely to recall feeling depression and anxiety
6716823 the researchers also didnt account for other factors known to affect breast cancer risk such as family history or weight
6716824 this campaign was always going to be closer than many people thought it would be
6716825 poor obama seems to have thought it wouldnt be close at all
6716826 sometimes its hard to tell if barack obama is running for president or mr universe
6716827 not like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
6716828 if anyone thinks that picking a woman will simply placate hillary clintons supporters i think thats very patronising
6716829 well ive never directed any play before but i did act in a 3rd grade christmas pagent
6716830 sometimes its hard to tell if barack obama is running for president or mr universe
6716831 one of the guys at warner said i had made a proposal to make a really interesting set of games i can remember him not even blinking and looking at me and saying nolan why dont you innovate kind of like you did last year none of this new stuff he did not understand what he said he was so out of tune with what the nature of innovation is and ive been thinking i was going to get that put into needle point sometime
6716832 these people were my friends and co workers and we were sort of united in this quest for cool stuff
6716833 the marketing department had never played a video game marketing thought the programmers were lazy the programmers thought marketing was stupid we didnt like them they didnt like us
6716834 warner put a lot of money into the company which certainly helped pay for marketing and manufacturing the games and computers
6716835 if there is anything engineers despise it is dumb marketers defining the impossible

6716870 obama is slipping in the polls and i think its because hes seen as going with the flow hes not taking on the crucial issues instead he frequently sounds like hes reading the lines from the book primary colors many people seem to think that just getting obama into the white house would be a great victory because of the symbolism but do we really know that policies that affect peoples lives will really change that will only happen if movements propel that change
6716871 the mystery to me is the widespread assumption that obama is a progressive
6716872 that these positions are now coming into view is not evidence of a centrist shift it is evidence that obamas bare record contains many longstanding issue commitments that should be and should have been alarming to progressives
6716873 in many respects obama promises a re run of the clinton presidency which in some ways was the last republican presidency of the 20th century clinton too pushed a fatherhood agenda he initiated the welfare to work policy he expanded the death penalty he signed the defense of marriage act he secured nafta as a re run of bill clinton obamas candidacy and possible presidency may not be surprising its more a comment on the present state of the democratic party than a revelation about individual leaders but progressives endured bill clinton without posing strong and broad critiques in the name of supporting a democrat after those long harsh years in the reagan wilderness and look where it got us so instead of apologizing and parsing for obama we should stake out our differences and mobilize our critique

6716883 when i did my first album i said that when i did a second i wanted gary to write for me i think he is a great songwriter one of britains best songwriters i love take that so it was always a dream of mine that hed write for me
6716884 he said it was fantastic i hope in future gary will play when i sing
6716885 when i was contacted by bryn about performing at the festival i said i would like whoever won the nancy role to sing in concert with me
6716886 i think its important that we help promote the people we choose to win i backed jodie really quietly for the whole time as i really believed in her when people see her do other things they will realise what a star she really is
6716887 bryn has asked me to be involved for a few years but because of filming ive never been able to
6716888 but this year i hadnt finalised my schedule for torchwood so i told them to make sure i could have time off to do it
6716889 torchwood has really reached out to audiences worldwide and the fact its moved up the channels on the bbc is incredible
6716890 we moved from cardiff bay to the beach i really love wales so its great to have the chance to play at a big festival here
6716891 i love the people and the place we decided to have our civil partnership in cardiff and the response we got from people was unbelievable our neighbours in sully are wonderful i feel at home here
6716892 we have a house in london because we still work in london but our main house is in wales
6716893 i never want to be pigeon holed im an entertainer whether im entertaining a teenage girl whos watching me judging on a tv show a young guy watching doctor who or a couple watching torchwood the fact i can diversify is great
6716894 ooh i dont know you will have to watch they are talking about it i would like to see a year hiatus before theres another one you need to put a pause on something when you have such a good thing going rather than flog it like a dead horse

6716900 ormai il problema non copiare ma scegliere le fonti giuste
6716901 this regulation is not about contraception its about abortion and conscience
6716902 this lack of knowledge of provider conscience law within the health professions can be detrimental to conscience and other rights particularly for individuals and entities with moral objections to abortion and other medical procedures
6716903 the proposed regulations and secretary leavitts public comments about them leave the door open as to whether institutions and individuals can deny access to contraception
6716904 while the rules are not identical to the draft proposal being circulated by hhs last month the agency interprets existing conscientious objection laws so broadly that it could result in women not receiving information they need to make informed healthcare decisions
6716905 it undermines the doctor patient relationship because women will now have to question whether their health care providers are giving them complete and unbiased information and the best care possible
6716906 t he issue i asked to be addressed in this regulation is not abortion or contraceptives but the legal right medical practitioners have to practice according to their conscience and patients should be able to choose a doctor who has beliefs like his or hers the department is still contemplating if it will issue a regulation or not if it does it will be directly focused on the protection of practitioner conscience
6716907 is the fear here that so many doctors will refuse that it will somehow make it difficult for a woman to get an abortion that hasnt happened but what if it did wouldnt that be an important and legitimate social statement
6716908 the basic idea is that people should not be forced to say or to do things they believe are morally wrong in particular health care professionals should not be forced to provide services that violate their own conscience
6716909 freedom of expression and action are unfit barter for admission to medical employment or training
6716910 by leaving the term abortion undefined the regulations create all sort of space for ideology and political views to insinuate themselves into medical practices emergency rooms and clinics all across the country and when that happens women will suffer
6716911 in a field where were already losing a disproportionate number of doctors this would enable them not only to stay but also maybe to recruit more doctors who are highly qualified and can provide quality care to their patients
6716912 its going to be 5 000 toward every familys purchase of health insurance something that basically would be a non event for people already getting insurance from their employer but for those who are buying it out of pocket a lot of help there
6716913 our estimates are that that will cost about 20 billion if you configure it along the lines of states like minnesota that have been successful in reaching this population
6716914 what we estimate is that sen obamas health plan would reduce the cost of health care by about 2 500 for a typical family
6716915 thats a combination of direct out of pocket costs that the family no longer has to make and premium payments from their employers that families are now paying in the lower wages that they receive
6716916 after 2025 if health care keeps growing like it has in the last 40 years then there will actually be less money for education roads military fashion and everything else

6716940 it was back in february i did a beatles antiques roadshow in liverpool with dom littlewood hunting out fakes and forgeries of beatles memorabilia we had about two or three hundred people turn up for valuations
6716941 proper antiques are what i do that sort of thing the beatles is a fairly new world for the antiques market fraught with danger i have to say the official figure is six per cent of the stuff is actually real
6716942 what were hoping to do is taking it on to the next stage we probably scared people a little bit but now we can show them how to shop with confidence
6716943 the painters den is becoming the headquarters of our antiques and interiors side of things charlie and i cannot only get people beautiful antiques we can also do all their furnishings for them as well because of the contacts weve got we do all original antiques but if people want the carpets and furnishings to match then we can get them
6716944 theres not a shop i had a shop in long melford once would never have another one
6716945 the danger is you open up a shop like i did and then you realise 90 per cent of the people that walk in just lick ice creams and say look at the price of that or i bet thats a constable and youre thinking oh god please leave or buy something shops are definitely out
6716946 they want some fabulous pieces for it thats the sort of thing that were talking about
6716947 its a theme park attitude with a nice british aspect
6716948 if the telly was thrown away theyd still have a job
6716949 a young couple that we worked with yesterday had saved up 10 000 for their wedding if theyd put that money in the bank yesterday and taken it out three months later it theyd end up with around 130 interest
6716950 the idea of the show is that over those 12 weeks they decide to either give their money to me to go and do nice things with antiques and interiors to get a higher return or they give it to an artist who sells really modern wacky art shes considered high risk and what i do medium risk
6716951 oh no its real money if the artist loses the money the couple have lost the money and duncans money is duncans money if it goes wrong it goes very wrong thats the fun of it you see
6716952 we said what a brave couple they are its their money theyve taken years to save
6716953 i walked into a house with my parents when i was about 10 years old and my parents friends had a canaletto in the hall and i said why have you got this modern picture in your hallway when all your collection is older
6716954 so they got it x rayed and it turned out to be painted on a rice bag and made by someone in a prison in naples in the 1950s it was junk worth about 3 000 and they paid 250 000 for it so there we are i dont know how but i just knew
6716955 you cant say to someone this is rubbish theyll say why it rubbish you get hooked trying to find out why these things arent right
6716956 you have to trust your instincts with a lot of things we dont trust our instincts enough
6716957 antiques generate love dont they something lovely whereas modern things dont its like a traditional christmas scene compared to a big unloved empty house
6716958 you get your own stand at an antiques fair for 10 you buy and sell and meet a lot of other people its quite a nice way of earning some money over the weekend
6716959 twenty three years ago antiques fairs were antiques fairs now i went to one on sunday and it was just junk it was a car boot sale with a lid on it was everyones old crap
6716960 there are still some great fairs and they tend to be the same ones that were great 23 years ago
6716961 but having a shop is rather boring all the cast from lovejoy came over and we had a big party then you sit there nothing happening so you end up paying someone else to sit there for you
6716962 since then all ive done is deal with private customers and talk about antiques fakes and forgeries
6716963 the fakers that dont get caught are the ones that use the right materials
6716964 the same goes with paintings use the right pigmentation use the right materials
6716965 it cost 10 to make in their shed the week before they made it out of wallpaper paste and ky jelly
6716966 no one could have told the difference its was old paper old printing and the original print even an expert would have really really struggled you could go round and filter these things into auctions around the country no ones going to know
6716967 about 25 of everything youll see is rubbish and you have to think why is it happening
6716968 people now think they too can read a book watch two programmes and go to auction anyone that fakes or forges anything is having a field day now
6716969 twenty years ago an expert would have said im not sure about that ive seen 10 000 in the last 30 years im not sure a member of the general public will say i saw one of them on telly it must be okay as long as the fakes are good the public are lapping them up by the ton the fake and forge market is capitalising on that by the bucketload three out of four people going to auction now are general public
6716970 when belchamp hall was built in the 1700s there were about five million people in great britain
6716971 there was a lovely old chap and just before the first world war he worked in an antiques furniture place victorian furniture would come in modern but 15 20 years out of date to his workshop their job was to break it up and turn it into a georgian item which had value so every victorian piece that came into his workshop would be pulled apart and turned into a georgian item
6716972 first of all it was made by craftsmen or put back together by craftsmen its an old wood and its now in 2008 got another 100 years of patina on it how are you going to tell its not georgian youre going to struggle so for every four georgian pieces you see one will be victorian one will be out and out rubbish thats the problem you have in antiques

6716975 sdbs it stands for sell design build sell sdbs is in contrast to designing something building it and then trying to sell it which is the model most big and small tech companies follow a lot of start ups are based on hypotheses they build something and start interacting with customers and never verify it what they are doing is rationalizing the hypothesis rather than evaluating it and verifying it
6716976 if you do this you will be incredibly fast in learning and you can pick one of your ideas with confidence
6716977 at one point in time we had three different businesses in play and were trying to figure out which ones would stick
6716978 unlike typical start ups we spent a lot of time on validation
6716979 it has paid off in spades all of the money we are now investing is in the right place
6716980 the concept is that there is a very small minority of customers out there who are called lead users
6716981 lead users are typically people who have such a strong need or pain that they go out and build something on their own to solve the pain the goal of the process is to be able to identify those lead users identify how they are solving their problem then bring it back and commercialize the product for the majority of the market

6717016 the mindless murder of rhys jones 12 months ago today stunned the city of liverpool it was particularly poignant for evertonians because of rhys strong allegiance to the club but it also had a profound impact on the entire liverpool community
6717017 the dignity shown by rhys family over the past 12 months has been remarkable and the charitable work undertaken both in liverpool and throughout the country in his name is something that deserves great support

6717023 we maintain neutrality in providing medical treatment in the camps for the displaced people in dantewada district located in south chhattisgarh medical teams also provide mobile health services and nutritional support to those in need in remote rural areas surprisingly the situation in chhattisgarh is only one of several armed conflicts occurring throughout india for years with civilians caught between various belligerent parties as a consequence many people continue to live in an atmosphere of fear and violence with little or no access to health care

6717064 there are too many marketers and charlatans out to make a fast buck on the expense of the vulnerable acne sufferers cannot afford to spend their hard earned money on useless pricey acne cures and quick fixes only to be disappointed time and time again
6717065 is that even the so called natural approaches to the treatment of acne that are aimed to cure acne from within are either unrealistic impractical and often pricey or they are just the same one dimensional gimmick cures disguised as holistic solutions
6717066 there is simply no other way but the holistic way
6717067 the acne no more program was born out of these necessities
6717068 i had terrible acne for more than 9 years there were many times when i seriously thought about giving up until i found your program today my skin is practically perfect i look and i feel like a new woman you really made a difference here and i have no words to express my gratitude

6717079 these vocs create that new smell as they are slowly released from walls and furniture but they along with methanol and carbon monoxide are not good for your health even in small amounts
6717080 gold when in very small particles becomes very active under sunlight the electromagnetic field of the sunlight can couple with the oscillations of the electrons in the gold particles and creates a resonance
6717081 the magnetic field on the surface of the gold nanoparticles can be enhanced by up to hundred times which breaks apart the pollutant molecules in the air
6717082 this technology is solar powered and is very energy efficient because only the particles of gold heat up
6717083 once this technology can be applied to produce speciality chemicals at ambient temperature it heralds significant changes in the economy and environmental impact of the chemical production

6717087 the magnetic field on the surface of the gold nanoparticles can be enhanced by up to hundred times which breaks apart the pollutant molecules in the air
6717088 this technology is solar powered and is very energy efficient because only the particles of gold heat up
6717089 once this technology can be applied to produce speciality chemicals at ambient temperature it heralds significant changes in the economy and environmental impact of the chemical production
6717090 dogs may increase airborne particles that would encourage inflammation and thereby alter upper airway anatomy early in life causing an increased susceptibility for adult snoring
6717091 the mans best friend cannot be blamed for snoring it is vibration of respiratory structures and the resulting sound is because of obstructed air movement during breathing while sleeping
6717092 the irregular airflow is caused by a blockage and usually either due to throat weakness or mispositioned jaw or often caused by tension in the muscles or fat gathering around the throat or obstruction in nasal passageway
6717093 obesity is a major cause of snoring and sleep apnoea
6717094 when the olympic torch ran in london mr prime minister you personally welcomed the torch and you also expressed support for the beijing olympic games for which we would like to express our appreciation and gratitude

6717108 this week has been amazing ive tried so many new things sometimes achieving stuff i never thought i would canoeing has got to be a highlight i was scared at first but i have ended up really enjoying myself its the end of the week and i dont want to go home i have had such a good time and met so many fantastic people its made me feel like a kid again
6717109 now we are giving control to the player this is maybe the most important element we are changing
6717110 my diagnostic is horrible can i do well on the real thing
6717111 i know my weaknesses already that example wont happen to me because i would already know physics is my strength and biology my weakness
6717112 from 1990 till 2005 i would understand our incapability due to the persecutions and jailing of samir geagea
6717113 from 1994 till 2005 hayd el fatra bayn 1990 wa 1994 masla7tak
6717114 this year so far coolest for at least 5 years
6717115 we can expect with high probability this year will be cooler than the previous five years
6717116 definitely the la nina should have had an effect how much we cannot say
6717117 up to july 2008 this year has been cooler than the previous five years at least it still looks like its warmer than average
6717118 of course at the beginning of the year there was la nina and that would have had the effect of suppressing temperatures somewhat as well
6717119 chillier weather this year is partly because of a global weather pattern called la nina that follows a periodic warming effect called el nino
6717120 for example they are driven by shifting ocean currents and dips do not undermine the case that man made greenhouse gas emissions are causing long term global warming climate scientists say
6717121 the first half of 2008 was the coolest for at least five years
6717122 big 6 multidecadal cycles pdo ipo amo ao aao nao all flipped from cool to warm one by one
6717123 the first half of 2008 was the coolest for at least 5 years
6717124 that would make the first half of 2008 the coolest since 2000
6717125 chillier weather this year is partly because of a global weather pattern called la nina that follows a periodic warming effect called el nino
6717126 the whole year will almost certainly be cooler than recent years
6717127 that would make the first half of 2008 the coolest since 2000 one would think that the gw
6717128 the global mean temperature to end july was 0 28 degrees celsius above the 1961 1990 average
6717129 this report is a reminder once again that global warming is real and that unless we act we can expect more extreme weather in the years ahead
6717130 shouldnt the models have predicted the changes due to la nina el nino all i see in the hockey stick is an increase
6717131 also scientists have said that the warming due to co2 has overwhelmed any natural variation if this is the case how can la nina show any effect
6717132 globally it is very likely that the 1990s was the warmest decade and 1998 the warmest year in the instrumental record
6717133 high global temperature associated with the 1997 to 1998 el ni o event
6717134 there is only a one in 20 chance that the string of record high temperatures in 1997 1998 was simply an unusual event rather than a change point the start of a new and faster ongoing trend
6717135 the 1990s are likely to have been the warmest decade and 1998 the warmest year of the past 1000 years
6717136 i also remember nasa stating that 98 was the warmest temperatures since the 30s not warmer but that release has long been pulled from the web and no i do not have a copy
6717137 happiness found in other useful pursuits is infinitely more important to me than being right about evil humans and all that they do on a planet for an infinitely insignificant speck of time
6717138 during the past few decades global temperatures have persistently broken previous record highs every few years but never to the extent observed in 1998 each month this year has set a new all time record high global temperature figure 2 this is unprecedented and is not likely to occur in a stationary climate
6717139 gcm runs of future long term climate are not even base lined in any detail against current real world conditions
6717140 if we are heading for a maunder or dalton minimum the oil fields in siberia wont be worth squat as it will be too cold to drill
6717141 produced between fifteen and thirty pounds of manure per day
6717142 a public health and sanitation crisis of almost unimaginable dimensions loomed
6717143 and no possible solution could be devised after all the horse had been the dominant mode of transportation for thousands of years
6717144 the situation seemed dire in 1894 the times of london estimated that by 1950 every street in the city would be buried nine feet deep in horse manure one new york prognosticator of the 1890s concluded even without a supercomputer at hand that by 1930 the horse droppings would rise to manhattans third story windows
6717145 big 6 multidecadal oscillations just starting to flip to cool
6717146 i think it is also reasonable to predict that for example if the ice sheets were to become unstable then it would take one heck of a long time and a much lower temperature to reestablish them and so on
6717147 such cooling dips do not undermine the case that man made greenhouse gas emissions are causing long term global warming
6717148 the climate record suggests that north america could face a major drought event again in 500 to 1 000 years though springer said that manmade global warming could offset the cycle
6717149 i have 2008 so far in 20th place out of the last 30 according to uah and rss data

6717156 this year so far coolest for at least 5 years

6717170 i want the public to have confidence in our ability to deal with these sort of viruses when they happen
6717171 the primary concerns about lead are neurological and especially developmental
6717172 it really impairs development in rapidly developing neurological systems and developing brains the more it is studied the lower the levels at which we are able to document impairments
6717173 i was not expecting anything like this i thought it was going to be a few girls from the gym and coaches
6717174 the main thing that we would want them to do is clean it up
6717175 there is no reason new turf should have this much lead in it why put lead in products that kids are going to play on
6717176 the lead is imbedded in plastic but exposure to uv light and weathering makes the lead become available
6717177 so it is a question of how much will come out get picked up on hands or released into dust to be breathed in that is the challenge
6717178 what we find is that there is enough lead coming off to be a violation of california law
6717179 there could only potentially be a health risk if lead is leaving the field and leaving the field in amounts that are detrimental to kids
6717180 and the cpsc found that the amount of lead that would need to be ingested is absurd
6717181 none of our turf fields is on a replacement schedule at this time
6717182 our district is working on a comprehensive replacement cycle for facilities and equipment in the future but that work is yet to be completed we hope to get 10 12 or even 15 years of use out of the turf before replacing it but that depends on how well it holds up through the years
6717183 safety is our no 1 priority when it comes to our facilities
6717184 it is not just the students that use our facilities its the staff and community members there is organized and unorganized use of the fields so we are concerned about the safety we need to know if there is an exposure risk or is the lead there contained if there is exposure is it at a risky level
6717185 the primary concerns about lead are neurological and especially developmental
6717186 it really impairs development in rapidly developing neurological systems and developing brains the more it is studied the lower the levels at which we are able to document impairments
6717187 that proposal originally was rejected by the angling rules review board
6717188 that if we open up the consumptive fishery the impacts will be minimal because people will make a choice and if the surveys correct theyll choose not to retain fish
6717189 or maybe a nice fish or one that would otherwise be injured or dead
6717190 if you look in the southwest zone it would also close areas that we opened to resident trout fishing and for introduced brook trout
6717191 we have a lot of traps out there that are monitoring the movement of fish and looking at the densities of these cutthroat trout are everywhere and seeing good numbers of them
6717192 one of our goals in the native fish policy is to provide for consumptive and nonconsumptive opportunities
6717193 and so all our policies state this and yet when we bring these forward we just get attacked
6717194 it tended to wake the angling public up a little bit as to the potential impact of this proposal
6717195 when i first ran there were 50 teams in the early years and now its capped off at 1 000 teams plus there are high school teams and walking teams
6717196 its one of the biggest things around in running in oregon other than the race for the cure
6717197 the race for the cure draws 40 000 otherwise this has more people involved than anything else
6717198 we always caution motorists to be aware that there are runners on the road and to slow down be patient and make sure safety is a priority
6717199 were really thrilled to say we dont have many runner driver incidents people are really respectful and aware of us
6717200 lots of people this is the only thing they do
6717201 co workers talk them into a team and they go because its such a unique atmosphere its different than anything else out there its almost a carnival atmosphere
6717202 i didnt think id make one of my poorest tactical decisions in the semifinals of the olympic games
6717203 i ended up using all my kick on the curve
6717204 when youre in a race with six or seven of the fastest guys in the world you dont wait for the last 200 meters to make your move
6717205 i feel like could run another one right now thats not how you want to feel
6717206 vindicated i feel great i feel amazing i just won a gold medal
6717207 it was hard and this win wasnt just down to my goal
6717208 it was only achievable with the team we have and that we played for each other
6717209 this is such a reward for nine months of hard hard work and soul searching after the world cup
6717210 i have no idea why we cant win a final
6717211 its something im gonna keep asking myself for a long time you keep asking what you did wrong
6717212 we are not looking at the results but on how we play
6717213 soccer is not a matter of 1 0 or 2 0 its the way to find out the rhythm the match against norway is our key point in the tournament we found out our weak points and improved it thats why we stand here with the gold medal
6717214 i think i was leaning to my left waiting to dive to the left because the whole goal was open
6717215 and she ended up going right and i luckily kept some of my weight on the right
6717216 this is the worst kind of circumstance for local government to face
6717217 frankly i cant figure out how they are going to do it
6717218 i dont think any of us expected the cost of goods to continue to go up so dramatically
6717219 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one severe and or moderate life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women
6717220 on the other hand a general feeling of happiness and optimism can play a protective role
6717221 emotional stress is highly subjective and is difficult to measure accurately
6717222 women in this study were interviewed after breast cancer was diagnosed when they may be more likely to recall feeling depression and anxiety
6717223 the researchers also didnt account for other factors known to affect breast cancer risk such as family history or weight
6717224 it is a big disappointment as she has made a huge contribution to the success of our 4x400m relay squad in recent years

6717230 i dont think i couldve made this album at 21
6717231 i really needed to experience failure and being let down and being heartbroken and finding a way to persevere and to heal this album is a complete reflection of my heart and who i am and what ive experienced in the last three years
6717232 i finally feel like i can stand on two feet without being knocked down no matter what scrutiny comes along or whether people love it or hate it it doesnt matter because i really got to know myself through the making of this album
6717233 you really have to revisit those relationships to take something out of them and put them into music that was the hardest part the therapeutic side of the writing sessions there would be nights after i was writing when i would come home in nashville and lay in the bed and just weep and cry because i was so exhausted from having to think about some other guy for the whole night some of the men ive dated have been completely exhausting
6717234 dolly wrote the perfect song and the lyrics are breathtaking
6717235 just being able to sing on a song with my idol theres no better opportunity theres nothing im more proud of that ive done musically than do you know at the end of the song i just get to sing my heart out and have that emotional moment with my voice
6717236 she is a sweetheart and she tells me not to care what everybody says about it just follow my heart and remain true to myself and true to my talent
6717237 she just reminds me to be human and not get caught up in what the media has to say about things if anybody knows its definitely dolly
6717238 tony is just so strong and hes definitely my rock
6717239 i feel like through all the storms and the hurricanes when life feels like its moving faster than you can in the midst of all that craziness you can be so relaxed in love i dont have to prove anything to tony i dont have to be anybody else i dont have to be what he wants me to be he likes me just the way i am
6717240 he sings youre my sunday at the top of his lungs and the ending to do you know the last 38 seconds or minute and 12 seconds
6717241 its just so funny because hell always want to listen to that part over and over and over again and try to hold the note for as long as i can
6717242 i dont die and come in eighth or ninth i pretty much came in last i never come in ninth eighth im not talking the last two years or four im talking never
6717243 i planned on sitting behind tim just off his shoulder and using his pace and then popping him at the end
6717244 he had a very strong pickup at the 500 and i countered it and then people just started blowing past me and i couldnt handle it im extremely disappointed
6717245 i put a lot of pressure on myself every time i line up
6717246 im always very nervous i was nervous today i prepared well race well in all my preliminaries and didnt burn out or was exhausted i had enough sleep been eating well i have no explanation all i have is apologies im sorry i hate watching people apologize but now i know why they do
6717247 hitting the wall is one thing but watching guys i never lose to pass me the first thing that went through my head is am i done
6717248 i knew i could do it but i never knew it would happen
6717249 around 350 i thought i was fourth and i was tired but my whole thing is i just said go harder we have key words that are supposed to be technical cues and mine was just go harder i knew i was reeling him in and i knew with about 100 left i was going to pass him i knew my body was not happy but mentally had enough to hammer through to the end
6717250 why dont you tie a kerosene soaked rag around your ankles so the ants wont climb up and eat your candy ass
6717251 he was up a mountain and shouted i did it for you and i was at the bottom
6717252 all week youve been doing it ive done nothing for you to get angry at me directly
6717253 i dont want to give examples each one is so minor
6717254 you can do whatever you want its your own life
6717255 you know what happened 150 on the luxury bedroom 20 on cigarettes 20 on alcohol 20 on hair products and 99 special tokens
6717256 i dont even want to talk about whats happened tonight but its fine
6717257 i did really really want to stay i really did now its like maybe not
6717258 its not healthy to say the right thing all the time that was just one of the examples

6717266 the security territorial inviolability and independence of every neighbor state of russia
6717267 if we play like this we are not ready to play against any team if i see a display like this again there will be consequences
6717268 there are three long roads ahead of us the champions league turkish league and turkish cup we have fighting spirit and play nice football i dont see any obstacle that could prevent us reaching our targets i believe our main target will be taking last seasons champions league success at least one step for further

6717288 our model suggests that there is a second cell of air in each hemisphere which is characterised by air rising clouds forming storms developing and other processes associated with moisture in the air occurring in the mid latitudes
6717289 with more attention than ever before being focused on understanding our planets climate weather systems and atmosphere its important that scientists challenge their own assumptions and current theories of how these complex processes work i think our study sheds new light on the driving forces behind the weather in the mid latitudes

6717329 when the patient arrived at university hospitals bristol nhs foundation trust at around 5 15pm on august 20 our staff notified the police immediately of the situation
6717330 for the safety of all patients and staff the hospitals security team initiated an immediate lock down of the department locking and guarding all access and exit points to the a amp e department
6717331 the quick actions of our staff enabled us to provide the most secure environment possible for staff patients and visitors in and around the department

6717338 we are pleased to see that e on has decided to stop discriminating against its prepayment meter users
6717339 however we are of course deeply disappointed by the headline increases in the companys general prices for gas and electricity
6717340 e ons move proves the energy companies can afford to bring their prepayment tariffs into line with standard credit charges and blows apart their competitors argument that they need to charge prepay customers more for their fuel to cover the costs of maintaining the meters
6717341 while it is deeply disappointing that e ons customers will all have to pay more hundreds of thousands of prepayment customers will no longer simply have to pay more because they are poor
6717342 ministers need to act now to force the other energy companies to follow e ons lead by bringing in legislation

6717356 the government will no doubt seek to blame private contractors but the rash of data losses over the last two years confirm that there is something much more worrying at stake this government cannot keep any information safe
6717357 it is deeply worrying that after a number of major data losses and the publication of two government reports on high profile breaches of the data protection act more personal information has been reported lost
6717358 if you hand out memory sticks almost like confetti to companies and ask them to do research for you then you have to be absolutely certain that the company concerned has put in practice procedures which will be just as robust as the procedures that i hope the government has followed

6717404 its going to be 5 000 toward every familys purchase of health insurance something that basically would be a non event for people already getting insurance from their employer but for those who are buying it out of pocket a lot of help there
6717405 our estimates are that that will cost about 20 billion if you configure it along the lines of states like minnesota that have been successful in reaching this population
6717406 what we estimate is that sen obamas health plan would reduce the cost of health care by about 2 500 for a typical family
6717407 thats a combination of direct out of pocket costs that the family no longer has to make and premium payments from their employers that families are now paying in the lower wages that they receive
6717408 after 2025 if health care keeps growing like it has in the last 40 years then there will actually be less money for education roads military fashion and everything else
6717409 those airplanes are pressurized to about 6 000 to 7 000 feet
6717410 that is characterized by headache sleeplessness some nausea or loss of appetite
6717411 made sense seven years ago when the idea was first floated because the market was so strong
6717412 the bank needs to be repaid and so were committed to keep things moving
6717413 when you have to go four miles to get a carton of milk thats rural
6717414 the basic idea is that people should not be forced to say or to do things they believe are morally wrong in particular health care professionals should not be forced to provide services that violate their own conscience
6717415 freedom of expression and action are unfit barter for admission to medical employment or training
6717416 by leaving the term abortion undefined the regulations create all sort of space for ideology and political views to insinuate themselves into medical practices emergency rooms and clinics all across the country and when that happens women will suffer
6717417 in a field where were already losing a disproportionate number of doctors this would enable them not only to stay but also maybe to recruit more doctors who are highly qualified and can provide quality care to their patients
6717418 bsp winning seats in municipal elections last year has not affected our strength they have not won any seats reserved for dalits they won some seats in the mcd because we were a little weak then
6717419 i see no threat from bsp and we are not disturbed by their rise they will not be able to pose any threat to our traditional vote bank
6717420 this is not going to help bsp i am confident that we will emerge victorious for the third consecutive term in the polls
6717421 it does not mean that bsp is powerful the fact was that congress was weak at that time now our party has strengthened itself
6717422 affordability plays its part but the desire to wait and see how low prices will go is another important factor
6717423 the fact the rates are comparable means there is still some way to go between where they are now and where they should be
6717424 since the credit crunch lenders have been demanding bigger deposits and raising rates to the point where the market has become ridiculously quiet
6717425 uk mortgage lenders actions have been like putting the breaks on a super tanker that has finally halted

6717455 the chinese have made it abundantly clear that they are not going to be scared away
6717456 on the contrary they are increasing their investment in our country
6717457 we have immediately after the incident taken effective measures to ensure it does not happen again
6717458 i would understand that some foreign investors might be a bit worried about going to the place where the massacre took place
6717459 but i do not think it will have any long term impact there have been no such incidents in the main economic centres of the country and here in addis i would argue that it is probably one of the safest cities on earth
6717460 i hope it will be a speedy process it can take many years but i very much hope that this will not be one of those very protracted processes they tell me that two to three years would be a reasonably expeditious process
6717461 i do not think they should be obstacles as you know we are a least developed country and least developed countries benefit from what is called a special and differential treatment in the wto

6717466 in 2003 to 2004 26 free range broilers flocks excreting campylobacter were studied for identification of campylobacter species and genotype diversity seventeen flocks were sampled at the end of the indoor rearing period and 9 before departure to the slaughterhouse after access to an open area
6717467 out of 513 isolates 315 were identified as campylobacter jejuni and 198 as campylobacter coli pulsed field gel electrophoresis analysis revealed 35 genotypes for c jejuni and 43 genotypes for c coli 38 4 of the isolates were clustered into 16 genetic groups this kind of poultry production system is characterized by a large number of campylobacter coli isolates flocks sampled during the indoor phase were predominantly contaminated by c jejuni whereas those sampled during warm months were predominantly contaminated by c coli the campylobacter population was genetically highly diverse multiple genotypes were detected in a single flock six flocks were each found to harbor a mixture of genotypes these isolates were genetically closely related and were grouped into clusters of at least 80 genetic similarity isolates with genotypes found in different flocks and strains but sharing the same genetic clusters were detected in different farms and at different times in the year flocks sampled during the indoor rearing period and when farmers use fresh farm made litter were associated with a small number of clusters

6717549 i havent even thought much about that the loss of gene for me is way bigger than what kind of cba comes out that will take care of itself
6717550 when you start talking about those old raider teams everybody just thinks we were a bunch of nuts who just happened to play well together
6717551 but gene played the same way as he was as an executive with the players association gene was a clever player he was physically gifted but mentally he was a notch above
6717552 we used to joke all the time about gene hes dumb like a fox
6717553 look at the body of work from when he played and hes in the hall of fame and you look at the body of work since hes played and its hall of fame material too
6717554 youre going to get a fight from me anybody that wants to dog the guy the guy did a fantastic job
6717555 were putting rubber suits on raiola and pumping him up to make him look a lot bigger
6717556 in base defense when only two corners trot out there obviously brian and travis fisher are the starters
6717557 we are truly grateful to edwin because this could have never happened without him
6717558 there was just no way we would have ever been able to raise the money
6717559 we usually raise money for our trips by selling water and boxes of m amp ms outside but we were trying to do it in december and it was just too cold
6717560 i didnt think we were going to be able to do it it was just too much money
6717561 what we gave wasnt much but it got the ball rolling and that was great
6717562 the wall had been closed for seven days so when we got there there were just so many people there that they didnt think it was safe for us to play
6717563 they were being very careful about our safety especially after the stabbing on the first night of the olympics
6717564 if you play music it gives you something to do when you are having a bad day

6717566 i grew up in the church dad and mom forced us to sing it was part of life you grow to love it and it never leaves you
6717567 thats what i do i sing to keep my spirits up
6717568 im still getting used to jon kitna his cadence and how he throws the ball its coming along
6717569 michael has got the kind of skills to be kind of a half wide receiver
6717570 hes a good blocker he can do a lot of motions and be a blocker out of the backfield he has a lot of potential to add to the offense to make it difficult to know what were doing from snap to snap
6717571 hes gotta figure out what hes doing from snap to snap
6717572 she just asked me to come to the studio and just chill
6717573 and then she asked me to sing on one of her tracks because i was playing around she knew me but she didnt know i could sing
6717574 she called me this off season and asked me to do the same song at a festival but i couldnt do it i was too busy
6717575 in the off season we get together and do a jam session
6717576 i was just up there trying to hold a tune
6717577 he can do all the runs and riffs and all that i was just trying to hold my own and have fun with the guys hes cool he gives us a tune every now and then
6717578 this is a total 180 its ridiculous this new facility we have

6717595 if we learned anything from the music business they just dont win any friends by suing their consumers
6717596 speaking personally i think our industry does not want to fall foul of what happened with music
6717597 im not a huge fan of trying to punish your consumer albeit these people have clearly stolen intellectual property i think there are better ways of resolving this within our power as developers and publishers
6717598 i think there are better solutions than chasing people for money im not sure what they are other than to build game experiences that make it more difficult for there to be any value in pirating games
6717599 i think that theres been this dirty little secret among hardware manufacturers which is that the perception of free content even if youre supposed to pay for it on pcs is some sort hidden benefit that you get when you buy a pc like a right to download music for free or a right to download pirated movies and games
6717600 unfortunately eca has yet to take a public position on piracy which is itself a very complex and encompassing issue as for the esa we cannot comment on their hiring practices or policies

6717629 the basic idea is that people should not be forced to say or to do things they believe are morally wrong in particular health care professionals should not be forced to provide services that violate their own conscience
6717630 freedom of expression and action are unfit barter for admission to medical employment or training
6717631 by leaving the term abortion undefined the regulations create all sort of space for ideology and political views to insinuate themselves into medical practices emergency rooms and clinics all across the country and when that happens women will suffer
6717632 in a field where were already losing a disproportionate number of doctors this would enable them not only to stay but also maybe to recruit more doctors who are highly qualified and can provide quality care to their patients
6717633 made sense seven years ago when the idea was first floated because the market was so strong

6717638 its going to be 5 000 toward every familys purchase of health insurance something that basically would be a non event for people already getting insurance from their employer but for those who are buying it out of pocket a lot of help there
6717639 our estimates are that that will cost about 20 billion if you configure it along the lines of states like minnesota that have been successful in reaching this population
6717640 what we estimate is that sen obamas health plan would reduce the cost of health care by about 2 500 for a typical family
6717641 thats a combination of direct out of pocket costs that the family no longer has to make and premium payments from their employers that families are now paying in the lower wages that they receive
6717642 after 2025 if health care keeps growing like it has in the last 40 years then there will actually be less money for education roads military fashion and everything else

6717698 todays judgment reflects the abhorrence of decent society at the methods employed by the united states government in the supposed war on terror
6717699 compelling the british government to release information that can prove mr mohameds innocence is one obvious step towards making up for the years of torture that he has suffered

6717841 it shows just how far we have moved on over the past 18 years to have so many people take part in pride whether they be gay or straight is something i never dreamed i would see and it makes me so proud to be a police officer

6717863 those who deal in counterfeit health products are solely motivated by greed they prey upon an unsuspecting public with no regard for potentially placing the publics health at risk we will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to pursue these counterfeiters to the fullest extent of the law

6717974 monarchs of such countries as spain and japan failed to make the cut

6717981 we are literally jumping for joy here it consolidates our position and is great news for the island bucking the recessionary trend in the rest of the country
6717982 this facility will be pushing out between blades capable of producing between one and 1 5 gigawatts of electricity a year that is equivalent to a nuclear power station
6717983 central to the investment in the island of tens of millions of pounds is the councils eco island vision and the uk governments commitment to onshore and offshore wind energy re stated to me in a meeting just this week with the secretary of state
6717984 the iw is set to become a major hub for innovation and the manufacture of blades for some of the 7 000 new wind turbines needed to meet our ambitious targets
6717985 if the scheme meets the necessary planning requirements it will constitute excellent news both for local employment and for the wider economy of the island
6717986 the feminazis have infiltrated institutions and theres been a transfer of rights from guys to girls
6717987 this is another clear indication that the british economy is very seriously slowing down
6717988 i hope that all those people who have been running scare stories about the impact of immigration from eastern europe on jobs and housing will now eat a little humble pie
6717989 they should acknowledge that immigration flows are very sensitive to the state of the economy
6717990 foreign lawbreakers are being removed from britain at record levels with more than 2 500 deported so far this year
6717991 i have made it repeatedly clear that people who come here must earn the right to stay work hard and play by the rules
6717992 with the number of migrants arriving from the new eu countries now approaching one million the governments estimate that a maximum of just 13 000 migrants a year would arrive from these countries is woeful
6717993 we lived in a hostel that had been rejected by italian prisoners of war as uninhabitable the conditions were ludicrous with concrete floors a tin roof and narrow wooden bunk beds
6717994 it was very tough and the winter months were gruesome we used to sleep in all our clothes because it was freezing cold
6717995 there was such camaraderie among the girls though and we helped each other out but despite the wonderful spirit we used to say to each other what are we doing here
6717996 i think its too little too late for this badge of the 66 girls i was in the hostel with there are only two left now i honestly dont know what would have happened to this country without the land girls
6717997 it was bloody hard work although i loved the uniform and always dressed immaculately
6717998 the land girls were very important to the war effort because without them there would have been a complete shortage of food
6717999 it was very hard work we used to get up at 6am to milk the cows and wed still be haymaking at midnight
6718000 without the land girls the war would have been an impossible struggle i think the country probably would have run out of food because you couldnt import anything
6718001 i do think we should have received a badge earlier but its better late than never

6718005 an immigration removal centre can never be a suitable place for children and we were dismayed to find cases of disabled children being detained and some children spending large amounts of time incarcerated

6718019 we are very lucky but we need every penny of those two incomes if we do i cant imagine what it is like for the many millions of british families who arent as lucky as we are
6718020 a significant weapon for attacking the growing pain of fuel poverty
6718021 millions of people will get a huge shock when they realise how much it will cost to heat their homes this winter for the most vulnerable people the effect will be devastating
6718022 one by one the major energy companies are lining up to clobber customers with enormous price rises
6718023 it is unacceptable that on this governments watch these companies have benefited from a 9 billion windfall yet they continue to turn the screws on people who are already struggling with high prices
6718024 todays judgment reflects the abhorrence of decent society at the methods employed by the united states government in the supposed war on terror
6718025 it has taken the courts of this country to intervene and reiterate the importance of upholding the rule of law
6718026 compelling the british government to release information that can prove mr mohameds innocence is one obvious step towards making up for the years of torture that he has suffered

6718038 one in five appeals are successful this clearly shows that appeals provide a vital safety net
6718039 we must ensure that the process is of the highest quality and that it is subject to effective judicial scrutiny
6718040 the key task for policy makers going forward is to ensure that older people can increasingly play an active role in our ageing society
6718041 the days of assuming older people are dependants must now come to an end
6718042 an ageing society is a fact of life which should be welcomed and embraced not treated with concern
6718043 without going into the gory details of our family finances we are mortgaged up to the gills like a lot of other people
6718044 i had a two year fixed rate deal which ran out and it has been very painful to move on to a different one like millions of other people

6718049 it would be a very important gesture to the rest of the world if they were to say that these restrictions could be permanently removed
6718050 with the whole world watching the olympic games have captured the imagination of the whole global community
6718051 the 2008 beijing olympics have set a new standard for the olympic games which we in london in 2012 will seek to follow
6718052 the devils whore is certainly not intended as a history lesson i have quite consciously taken liberties with known facts and personalities in order to construct a different kind of truth the sort of truth our friends in the north told about post war britain the sort of truth a documentary approach cannot reveal

6718054 we have been made aware of a security breach at the offices of an external contractor involving the loss of personal information about offenders in england and wales
6718055 a full investigation is being conducted police and the information commissioner have been informed
6718056 the british taxpayer will be absolutely outraged if they are made to pick up the bill for compensation to serious criminals
6718057 charlie chaplin could do a better job running the home office than this
6718058 the government will no doubt seek to blame private contractors but the rash of data losses over the last two years confirm that there is something much more worrying at stake this government cannot keep any information safe
6718059 one of the possible consequences is that they criminals will bring legal actions against the government and the taxpayer will then have to pay damages to people who appear to be pretty undeserving because of the governments incompetence
6718060 following the momentum from a solid first year were excited about a fantastic second season on e
6718061 with fresh new fare and established fan favourites like extreme makeover home edition and how i met your mother in addition to our e signature series like the soup and e news were setting the benchmark high this season as canadas destination for everything entertainment
6718062 its embraced in our culture its part of our way of life
6718063 the delivery of the games has been quite awesome and quite humbling
6718064 we have a real opportunity not just to celebrate but to bring every citizen of the city into the games every night to give them a sense of ownership over the project
6718065 this public engagement is going to be an important part of our story
6718066 were not going to assume that we can just do things the way theyve been done before and expect our seats to be full
6718067 its a very complex challenge so the atmosphere is what the athletes and spectators determined to improve it
6718068 we will do everything we can to get more tickets in hands of public

6718079 the thing that i will worry about the most is his counterpunch i will have to adjust my style by not moving too fast
6718080 he doesnt know anything about fair play the spectators saw that but not the judges and thats the only thing that matters
6718081 it was very dangerous and it could have ended the fight
6718082 locking both low income pupils and vocational education into second class status
6718083 what is particularly striking about the entire approach in the gcse game is just how anti education it is
6718084 the value of participating in a course is insignificant compared to the grade the pupil gains at the end of the course thats why lower performers are being encouraged to do pointless vocational courses
6718085 there are many paths to success including vocational as well as academic options indeed 85 per cent of employers would encourage young people to take vocational qualifications
6718086 while many young people will now go onto further academic study at a level for others it may not be the right choice
6718087 it is very concerning that the gap between boys and girls appears to be widening again
6718088 the fall in the number of children taking foreign languages is of concern particularly as we know from last years results that there is wide regional gap in those taking these exams
6718089 my body is still in good condition so i have no problems
6718090 obviously i got older but i have gained more experience technically and strategically in fighting against u s russian and cuban boxers

6718093 he doesnt know anything about fair play the spectators saw that but not the judges and thats the only thing that matters
6718094 it was very dangerous and it could have ended the fight
6718095 we have no reason to doubt the integrity of the judges
6718096 but we have a process that well follow because we take any notion of impropriety very seriously
6718097 i won this bout but it was stolen it was unfair
6718098 the penalty was good and they should have called it earlier
6718099 it is not fair play not the sporting thing to do i could have been hurt and it could have been the end of the fight that is not the way i want to win my fights

6718123 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
6718124 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
6718125 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
6718126 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
6718127 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
6718128 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
6718129 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
6718130 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
6718131 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
6718132 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
6718133 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
6718134 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
6718135 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
6718136 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
6718137 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
6718138 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
6718139 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
6718140 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
6718141 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
6718142 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
6718143 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
6718144 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
6718145 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
6718146 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
6718147 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
6718148 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
6718149 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
6718150 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
6718151 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
6718152 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets

6718159 charlie chaplin could do a better job of running the home office than this labour government
6718160 the home office is entrusted with a great deal of highly confidential material and it seems to be entirely incapable of keeping it secure and the consequences are very serious theyre serious because it may lead to the identity of the people involved being revealed
6718161 one of the possible consequences is that criminals will bring legal actions against the government and the taxpayer will then have to pay damages to people who appear to be pretty undeserving because of the governments incompetence

6718394 wtc 7 building could not have collapsed as a result of internal fire and external debris no plane hit this building this is the only case of a steel frame building collapsing through fire in the world the fire on this building was small amp localized therefore what is the cause

6718562 there is still more cheering of open access in anthropology in north america than there is actual practice in other parts of the world there is more of the actual practice with less of the fanfare for example in the directory of open access journals 83 of open access journals in anthropology are published outside of north america that is 43 of the 52 currently listed with some of the leading places being in no particular order india mexico colombia venezuela brazil chile and even estonia based on that alone most of the talk about open access anthropology is coming out of the u s and most of the actual work in open access publishing is coming out of asia and latin america outside of the arena of american anthropology

6718564 let us keep in mind the broader issue which is how the u s military and intelligence are looking for ways of incorporating scholars in producing a global surveillance net one way is to bring social scientists on counterinsurgency and pacification missions another is to have them conduct analysis of stolen iraqi documents or to conduct fieldwork in areas of emerging or potential threat and describe the radicalization process and ways of counteracting it another is to comb through open access electronic resources

6718569 the feeling in practice isnt much different than the previous two years
6718570 at least its not different yet i think the upperclassmen are a bit more aware of whats coming and are excited
6718571 we hope the last two years allowed us to put enough into the offense and defense to be able to keep up with our opponents
6718572 i know we will suffer through some growing pains this season but we hope we can just focus on getting better each week and have some fun playing ball together
6718573 as for me and the other coaches we are excited but we are just too busy coaching and worrying to show it
6718574 assure us that deterrence will work but when the time comes to deter youre against it
6718575 at the beginning of the season i expected to improve at every race but i wanted timberman to be my best race
6718576 i really wanted to finish in the top 20 of my age group but thought that my bike time might fall short so i thought top 30 was more realistic
6718577 timberman is well attended by not just the racers but spectators and the local community all come out to show support thats what makes it great as you hear total strangers calling out your number or your name to cheer you on
6718578 these all out sprints will help me as i move up to the olympic and maybe 70 3 half ironman distances next year which will require a lot more working out
6718579 when you have podium finishers top three in age group as your training partners you are forced to work harder they not only provide you with a lot of support but they indirectly push you as well
6718580 at the end of every race we begin the analyzing process of our times looking back on where we could save a few seconds i am still on cloud nine about my efforts but i still have three more races to go so im already making changes to my transitions to shave off even more time even if only a few seconds
6718581 the timberman is well attended by pro and highly competitive age groupers from all around the u s and from other countries
6718582 olympic hopefuls and world champions usually will have this race on their schedule
6718583 chrissie wellington who won last years hawaii ironman won the timberman womens half ironman the first female who won the sprint event was pro cate snow who just won the lake placid ironman in july her husband tim snow also a pro was the first male
6718584 snows words at the awards podium surmised that in his opinion winning in a sprint can be a lot harder than a full ironman as one has to go all out and be aware of every second
6718585 the start of the swim is always a little scary
6718586 you are ensured that you will get kicked and bumped and this race was no exception it took a couple of minutes before i was able to free up into somewhat open water
6718587 swimming is my weakest event i was happy that when i looked at my time as i exited the water that i was almost exactly on target for my race goal 10 52 finish
6718588 timberman is by general consensus one of the hardest bike courses in the area the first seven miles of both the sprint and the 70 3 half ironman are the same and are considered the most demanding consisting of rolling hills with not a lot of straight stretches to really hammer
6718589 the first half mile is uphill the next 14 5 miles went by so quickly when i reached the turnaround i knew that if i kept at it i would make my goal of 54 minutes on the bike when i reached the dismount area and saw that i had done it in 52 50 i was elated
6718590 all i had to do was run my usual pace and i would finish well within my goal when i got to the turnaround at 1 5 miles i got some high fives from some of my friends from tryfury her triathlon club and this made me push a little harder i finished with my best run split ever 7 33 per mile
6718591 my overall time was two minutes faster than my original goal time i could hardly take my timing chip off at the end and i knew that i had given all i had and that is what makes this all fun when you can push yourself to do something that you do not think you are capable of doing
6718592 there was a bit of peer pressure presented by my in laws
6718593 the pressure was that i could either race with them or stay home again to babysit with grandma
6718594 maybe ill go for the half ironman distance in 2010 when i turn 40 timberman is right around my birthday so its a good present to myself
6718595 if i wasnt hooked before i sure am now what a great weekend
6718596 my biggest improvement was in the swim followed closely by the bike
6718597 to be honest with you last year i thought going 500 would have been beautiful
6718598 we were only supposed to have a decent season but this season so far definitely exceeds expectations
6718599 their team is from right outside of hartford and theres a lot of talent over there this is taking on the big dogs luckily they are coming to our house first
6718600 thats the first game lee played in for the beavers
6718601 we didnt even find out until after the game that he was previously on the ravens the beavers are a good team though regardless of if they have him or not we did good and we showed that we have talent the guys who we had covering him played really well and lee didnt even break 100 yards
6718602 there is a lot more talent this year too and a lot of the guys from last year have a year under their belt and learned the game while most teams have 30 35 players tops right now we have a roster of 40 legitimate ballplayers and they are all very capable

6718605 i came back to school to start soccer on august 8 and we have been going full steam ever since
6718606 moving up to division i is definitely going to be a challenge for us but were extremely excited and believe in ourselves and each other that we will be successful
6718607 unfortunately because we are not yet official members of the nec northeast conference we are not allowed to compete for a championship
6718608 but we are excited for the chance to get our name out there and show whats in store for the upcoming years
6718609 moving up to division i is a five year process to be officially titled division i
6718610 last year was our transitional phase so this year is declared the first year of the complete transition
6718611 there are numerous factors that go into the decision to move up with a major one being the desire for bryant to increase diversity and enrollment by expanding out of new england and catching interest in other areas
6718612 as far as athletics go the sports teams have done exceptionally well in the northeast 10 conference which is the hardest division ii conference with many teams getting a bid into the ncaa tournament
6718613 last year was our most successful year as we had an undefeated conference season only to lose in the conference final but making it to the second round of the ncaa and finishing with a 17 2 5 record
6718614 the difference between high school and college soccer is huge
6718615 in high school the competition is not always the best your team consists of players of all different levels and it really doesnt matter whether you had a bad game or not
6718616 in college it is the complete opposite you are playing with extremely talented players from all different states in a league where less talented teams do not exist
6718617 the intensity pace of the game talent of your teammates and opponents and commitment is incomparable to what you face in high school
6718618 i have really enjoyed myself at bryant the past two years and am really looking forward to my senior year
6718619 ive been through many changes since my transition from west point after my freshman year and am extremely happy i ended up where i am now
6718620 i have met some unbelievable people as well as been fortunate enough to be a part of a team whom i consider my family away from home
6718621 i truly love the game and wish to never have to give it up but i will instead be switching my focus to working on getting my professional career in order although i wont be playing competitively anymore i definitely plan to stay involved in the sport for many years to come through the various womens leagues and summer leagues in the area
6718622 as far as soccer goes we are very aware that this transition will be a challenge for us
6718623 we are moving into unfamiliar territory as far as not having played these teams before and not knowing what exactly to expect but we are confident in our ability as a team to be able to compete at this higher level
6718624 every year during preseason we establish team goals that we aim to achieve after each game and by the end of the season so if we continue to improve game by game then we will know that we have been successful in meeting our end of season goals
6718625 we lost in the semifinals of the conference my sophomore year and lost in the final my junior year so it was disappointing for us not to be able to get that last chance at winning the title so instead because it is our last year we are going to focus on doing the best we can to compete and do well in order to help pave the way for our underclassmen to be successful in the future

6718632 were 3 2 where we could very easily be 5 0
6718633 seabrooks stephan lewis our running back has been a standout player this year
6718634 he hasnt been 100 percent but being the level player he is hes still been able to excel derek vater is another key player he blew out his knee last year and is just getting back into peak form he was a key last week with four touchdown passes
6718635 only the top two teams receive a bye we would love to be one of the top two but we would also be happy with a third or fourth place finish ultimately our goal is obviously to make it to the championship game we are tied for third in our conference right now and we need to separate ourselves
6718636 exeter is just a great step up and it allows us to market ourselves a little bit better we have been all over the place we have played at winnacunnet high school and portsmouth high school raymond and haverhill mass but exeter is the best facility out of all of them
6718637 keegan pafford and gallagher hogan are two backs who were in the upper echelon in our division last year we have some depth at qb and we have some skill people
6718638 our biggest question mark is how this offensive line is going to develop frankly im optimistic we have some good linemen i just dont know how much depth we have there
6718639 yeah but you still have souhegan you still have milford and goffstown is dropping down from division ii
6718640 plymouth leaving is both good and bad because you aspire to be the best we had two good games with them two years ago you beat a team like that and it feels pretty sweet
6718641 in these scrimmages i think well be looking at the new kids to see how much they can help us and if the senior leadership is going to come to the forefront
6718642 were like a lot of teams in that we have to avoid injuries barring those injuries we certainly will be competitive

6718657 because you work so hard all year and you want to move on
6718658 we live by being aggressive and that was the winning run
6718659 he was just outstanding he is a pure hitter he has a batting cage in his backyard and he swings all day
6718660 we needed to ride on his shoulders to get the job done tonight and he did it
6718661 he has a hard fastball and he knows how to use his other pitches
6718662 i usually try to keep my cool and composure on the mound
6718663 i wanted to break 32 minutes but it was tough i was alone the whole race
6718664 i went out a little hard i didnt know what to expect because i didnt really remember the course
6718665 i just kept a good rhythm and i felt really good
6718666 you never know when you get to the starting line because everyone seems like theyre a good runner
6718667 i looked back a few times but there wasnt anybody close
6718668 i felt good today it was a personal record for me by about 50 seconds
6718669 so i felt really good there were a lot of good runners out there
6718670 the closest i ever got to alliette was probably about 100 yards
6718671 he took the lead from the get go and that was it he pretty much maintained
6718672 i wanted to get out as hard as i could i wanted to get out of the first mile at 5 50 and i think i got below that
6718673 swimming isnt as visible in this part of the country as say florida and south california and texas
6718674 there are a number of teams in new england we are going to be pushing the problem that we all face in this area is the challenge of pool space it would be great if we could use this as a launch off to keep pools open or make more
6718675 one year after the olympics we had our tryout for the lesson program which basically is learning about the sport
6718676 we had a line outside the pool and in the lobby and into the parking lot over 100 kids tried out that day
6718677 its the success a lot of good athletes just tend to gravitate toward swimming because of the success if you get a bunch of new people to try out and even half of them decide its not for them you have more people on the team that wouldnt have tried if it wasnt for the olympics
6718678 swimming is not necessarily looked on as a mainstream boys sports
6718679 phelps has given validity to the masculine aspect of the sport hes incredibly in shape and athletic even the basketball team was there rooting him on hes definitely been positive for the visibility of the sport
6718680 i think michael phelps that name will last a long time in the mainstream
6718681 you train your whole life and you want to win
6718682 if people want to assess the blame to me thats ok i mean i can take whatever it is that people are going to dish out
6718683 we had good chemistry the hand was back there she was there i dont know what happened
6718684 its an amazing thing to have an olympic medal but we had the game like we had it in our grasp and we let it slip away
6718685 because you work so hard all year and you want to move on
6718686 we live by being aggressive and that was the winning run
6718687 he was just outstanding he is a pure hitter he has a batting cage in his backyard and he swings all day
6718688 we needed to ride on his shoulders to get the job done tonight and he did it
6718689 he has a hard fastball and he knows how to use his other pitches
6718690 i usually try to keep my cool and composure on the mound
6718691 to be honest with you last year i thought going 500 would have been beautiful
6718692 we were only supposed to have a decent season but this season so far definitely exceeds expectations
6718693 their team is from right outside of hartford and theres a lot of talent over there this is taking on the big dogs luckily they are coming to our house first
6718694 thats the first game lee played in for the beavers
6718695 we didnt even find out until after the game that he was previously on the ravens the beavers are a good team though regardless of if they have him or not we did good and we showed that we have talent the guys who we had covering him played really well and lee didnt even break 100 yards
6718696 there is a lot more talent this year too and a lot of the guys from last year have a year under their belt and learned the game while most teams have 30 35 players tops right now we have a roster of 40 legitimate ballplayers and they are all very capable
6718697 it was more than what i expected i expected it to be fun but it was more than fun
6718698 everything about the country was great the lifestyle the people the soccer it was just amazing how much they love soccer over there
6718699 on our way to practice or games there would be people of all age groups playing soccer and if they werent playing they had a soccer ball in their hands
6718700 its not about nice cleats or a nice field in argentina
6718701 its all about the love of the game everyone was everywhere playing streets dirt driveways parks there were people playing
6718702 we were on our way back from a late match against river plate intramural and it was about 12 30 at night and every park was filled with teams and people training it was unbelievable
6718703 i would say that what was the most impressive is how much they love futbol
6718704 the level of play was very different from what im used to
6718705 they possessed the ball very well the playing was way more physical than here in the states
6718706 a rule that we learned really quick was the high kick or the dangerous play rule they dont have that in argentina its just a rule here in the states so high kicks close to your face are legal as well as playing the ball while youre on the ground that was hard to cope with
6718707 they were the best team we played we were nervous and getting used to the style of play we had our chances missing two breakaways and i had a shot outside the 18 that hit the crossbar but it was a good wake up of what we were up against
6718708 the next game we played against river plate intramural they were a great team as well we played under the lights turf field in river plate stadium grounds
6718709 our last match was against club atletico atlanta an argentine b division professional team
6718710 they had three players who played matches in the professional league and we tied them 2 2
6718711 they were a quick team i would say the fastest pace team we played
6718712 our tour guide got us tickets at the last minute and it was awesome
6718713 vindicated i feel great i feel amazing i just won a gold medal
6718714 if there is a question mark and we have a concern which we do we ask the governing body of any sport to look into it
6718715 gene was a great player he was an all pro he was a hall of famer if you look at the history of the nfl youre going to find out that he was one of the most influential people that the league has known he did so much not only for the players but also for the owners the teams and the game of pro football
6718716 this is deeper than head of the union passing away and its deeper than an ex player this is missing someone that is and was like family its a tough day for all of us
6718717 from what i hear he was a pretty good player
6718718 its a device for trapping lions in the scottish highlands
6718719 the squirrels catch up with him he doesnt catch up with the squirrels
6718720 were 3 2 where we could very easily be 5 0
6718721 seabrooks stephan lewis our running back has been a standout player this year
6718722 he hasnt been 100 percent but being the level player he is hes still been able to excel derek vater is another key player he blew out his knee last year and is just getting back into peak form he was a key last week with four touchdown passes

6718725 its certainly going to be a strange fall for me
6718726 i dont know what a fall is like without soccer
6718727 when shupe retired and wasnt replaced the assistant principal job changed drastically
6718728 you cant roll up to the field with just a little preparation
6718729 swimming isnt as visible in this part of the country as say florida and south california and texas
6718730 there are a number of teams in new england we are going to be pushing the problem that we all face in this area is the challenge of pool space it would be great if we could use this as a launch off to keep pools open or make more
6718731 one year after the olympics we had our tryout for the lesson program which basically is learning about the sport

6718736 i think michael phelps that name will last a long time in the mainstream
6718737 at first there was a sort of rivalry between the two of us and pat
6718738 it was always a friendly rivalry as we have been friends and playing soccer together since we were really young
6718739 we ended up not liking keene and pat put it in our heads that plymouth was a fun school the guys on the team were great and the coach was a good guy
6718740 george and i both talked to the plymouth coach and the next year we went to plymouth we never really planned in high school to go to the same college it just kind of happened
6718741 the three of us together is great because we know each others play styles very well so we mesh well
6718742 i think all three of us are aware its our last year so theres a lot of incentive to have a good season
6718743 in fact we have a very old team altogether so we all want this season to be a great one the ncaa tournament is the goal so we need to win the little east conference
6718744 lets see how you act after you get beaten after five and a half years
6718745 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
6718746 this is a guy who lived in one house for five and a half years in prison
6718747 i thought it was going to be a few girls from the gym and a few coaches so its a big surprise im still in shock that my dreams have come true its been a long month and i am really happy to be back in dallas
6718748 when i texted her that night she won all around i told her she would be doing interviews for hours but to call me when she can
6718749 we try to do things away from the gym and have girl nights
6718750 im going to probably keep them in my purse for now
6718751 between the two of us we have nine olympic medals so thats pretty amazing
6718752 were still wearing a target everyones going to want a piece of these guys and we have to weather the storm well have some hills and valleys and we have to keep climbing up the hill
6718753 a lot of teams will think well not do too well but well surprise them

6718760 i had an excellent start and i knew from that moment no one is going to go past me
6718761 we had reached an agreement with everton for the loan of tiago all that was needed was the players agreement and that never came
6718762 we take it therefore that tiago will stay with us
6718763 the market remains closed to us regarding players coming in like we already said some time ago now
6718764 on the chest i think the picture describes the guard a lot better than i can but if you would like a close up picture of the graphics just email me retail price for this guard is 50 dollars but it can be yours at a starting bid of 8 99

6718781 personalmente no tengo ni que decir lo que me gustar a competir ante nuestra afici n en este segundo gp de casa es tremendamente frustrante acudir a valencia como mero tercer piloto os lo aseguro
6718782 el circuito de valencia es un circuito completamente nuevo para todos por lo que es dif cil saber c mo se adaptar n tanto equipos como pilotos lo que est claro por el trabajo de simulaci n que hemos hecho es que es un circuito r pido con fuertes frenadas y tres puntos de adelantamiento muy buenos

6718797 its a good move for him and a good move for the club
6718798 we are always looking to improve and he is another good player
6718799 we have a good squad as it is now and we know shaun can play in a number of positions
6718800 im just really angry with her but on the same token im hurt too
6718801 she would allegedly say to dad you didnt pay me this week and hand him the credit union cheque book and hed look where he makes the records and say oh no i didnt pay you but what hed forgotten was he had written her a cheque out of the cibc account
6718802 even if she said to him can you lend me some money ill pay you back later he was not able to put it all together and see how much it was adding up to
6718803 my dad was lucky he was able to absorb the loss financially and he had a family to back him but there are a lot of people who arent in his position
6718804 i struggled i dont like being restrained and i had all this weight on me
6718805 i just dont want anybody else to go through this and i know kim wouldnt either
6718806 we certainly are willing to discuss any concerns with this individual
6718807 i dont know why something like this would happen in this day and age
6718808 we will be helping this family with the answers they are looking for that they need so that they can grieve properly
6718809 this is something that has happened recently and the family does not know what happened

6718815 i dont think i can do anything until i receive disclosure
6718816 its safe to say were not looking at anyone else for this
6718817 i just hope to god the person responsible for this is caught and i hope they experience every moment of what ive went through 10 times over
6718818 people start wondering like why is this person getting into trouble if hes so innocent
6718819 we have the tools to do something and its called the anti terrorism act
6718820 until that rats nest of gangsterism in hobbema is eradicated those people that live on that reserve are living in fear living with intimidation and their lives are threatened on a daily basis
6718821 if youre engaging in an activity for a political religious ideological reason and its one where youre committing criminal acts we can prosecute you and it has a bit more teeth if we use the anti terrorism provision
6718822 but im not sure they would fall under the definition of terrorist group
6718823 its against the law to shoot people its against the law to harass people
6718824 and since many women in business school marry those men they end up being stay at home wives regardless of their own vision of what they wanted from their careers

6718826 its unlikely that a broadcast network is ever again going to create a megahit like the cosby show which at its mid 80s peak drew as many as 50 million viewers an episode for several years now tvs top event has been foxs american idol last season it drew 28 8 million viewers a week
6718827 in many ways the networks themselves already have specific brand identities they just dont admit it for decades cbs has had the most elderly demographic among the major networks abc specializes in comedies and light dramas with strong female appeal fox with the exception of american idol is largely aimed at guys the fledgling cw is building on gossip girl and americas next top model to chase young women nbcs struggles are not unrelated to the fact that its still trying to be all things to all people

6718830 het was zondagavond mijn vrouw bracht de kinderen naar bed ik was in de huiskamer en bereidde me mentaal voor op de komende werkweek ik zat aan tafel met de krant terwijl de tv aanstond met een programma van de eo waar ik normaal eigenlijk nooit naar kijk een man praatte over zijn ontdekking van jezus en het evangelie langzaam werd ik erdoor gegrepen wacht eens even dacht ik hier spreekt een originele authentieke ziel iemand die echt geraakt is en geen flauwekul verkoopt ik bedacht me hoe mooi het is om zo gelovig te kunnen zijn goddelijke steun en kracht te ervaren dat zou ik ook wel willen terwijl ik het overwoog staarde ik naar een hoek van de kamer toen zag ik daar bijna bij het plafond een gouden gestalte zonder details in enkele ronde vormen met armen en benen die naar me toekwamen alsof ze me wilden omhelzen ik deed mijn ogen dicht en weer open en het was er nog het duurde een of twee minuten deze ervaring gaf mij veel voldoening iets wilde mij kennelijk vertellen dat het geloof van die man op tv ook voor mij toegankelijk was het hield een belofte in ik heb er heel enthousiast aan mijn vrouw over verteld ben er nog weken mee bezig geweest maar heb er verder mijn mond over gehouden om niet voor gek verklaard te worden
6718831 een jaar erna zijn mijn vrouw onze twee kinderen en ik het katholieke avontuur begonnen we werden actief in de kerk ik onder meer als ouderenbezoeker toen bisschop eijk een nieuwe pastor aanstelde die de vrijwilligers naar huis stuurde en de mis als een soort militair zonder bezieling afdramde zijn we naar een wijkkerk vertrokken en daar werd ik lid van het koor
6718832 nee helaas niet ik heb mijn best gedaan in de kerk negen jaar lang maar de belofte bleef onvervuld in de loop der jaren was ik de wonderlijke verschijning gaan beschouwen als een opzichzelfstaand moment van voorbijgaande aard ik accepteerde dat er geen vervolg op kwam ook onze betrokkenheid bij de wijkkerk is als een nachtkaars uitgegaan
6718833 begin 2005 ontdekten we rananda een amerikaanse verlichte meester die wanneer hij in nederland verblijft een maal per maand op zondagmiddag naar groningen komt hij zette mijn hele denkwereld op de kop met uitspraken zoals god heeft helemaal geen weet van deze wereld dat was een eyeopener ik had me altijd al afgevraagd hoe god de pijn en het lijden van onze wereld kon toelaten volgens rananda die zich op een cursus in wonderen baseert is god perfect is hij enkel licht en liefde die zich uitbreidt ik vond dat geweldig al bleef ik ook sceptisch dat ligt in mijn aard tot twee jaar geleden toen er weer een wonder gebeurde op vakantie in frankrijk reed ik zomaar een gelijkvloerse kruising van een nationale snelweg op ik had geen stoplicht of stopbord gezien en daar stond ik plotseling dwars op de weg stil om op een gaatje in de stroom langs jakkerende autos van rechts te wachten ik keek naar links en zag ook van die kant autos aanstormen ik keek mijn vrouw aan en ze begon te gillen ik dacht hier valt niet aan te ontkomen nu is het afgelopen ik deed mijn ogen dicht twee seconden later reed ik langzaam op de andere baan mee in het verkeer alsof de auto was opgepakt en netjes in de stroom was ingevoegd dit was echt een wonder cursus in wonderen is kenmerkend aan een wonder dat er tijd weg is en dat was precies wat hier gebeurd is dankzij de cursus stonden we voor wonderen open wellicht was er anders niks gebeurd vanaf toen was mijn scepsis voorbij heb ik veel meer vertrouwen gekregen in de theorie die in de cursus wordt verondersteld ik weet nu zeker dat god van mij houdt en dat de belofte is vervuld die van de verschijning van het gouden wezen uitging
6718834 two of the silliest pieces i have read on ya literature in ages

6718850 west belfasts paddy barnes guaranteed himself a bronze medal after his quarter final triumph in the light flyweight division he now faces chinas zou shiming a home grown favourite and a man who beat paddy in the world championships last year so no surprise to see paddy power offering 9 1 about barnes taking gold and 7 2 to clinch a silver
6718851 people within the party recognise that until the stability of the assembly is more firmly established on a longer term basis there will be reluctance among people who are westminster mps to give up their seats to work exclusively in the assembly there will be a phasing in of that approach
6718852 we have a choice as a people either you continue with the division or you seek to end it my party took the position that in the right circumstances it was possible to proceed but that we couldnt concede to terror criminal activities had to end guns had to be handed over and there had be support for the police the courts and the rule of law
6718853 while political parties in ni would have wide areas where they can agree if you put the conservative party and the labour party into the same room you would have battles every day on issues of socio economic policy
6718854 the differences we have we are talking about and attempting to reach agreement on there are battles but they are ending without blood being spilt and that perhaps is the difference between now and the past
6718855 atheist leaders will not be tempted to think they are the messenger of any good news from above or the agent of any higher purpose on earth or at very least they will not think this literally
6718856 in the past radical clerics featured but their influence has moved into the background
6718857 suicide bombing is not just a religious phenomenon it is employed by many secular organisations including the kurdish pkk and the marxist tamil tigers
6718858 ariel merari a tel aviv university psychologist has profiled 50 suicide bombers and found that there were hardly any common factors none were deranged or schizophrenic few had problems like depression merari concluded that the only factor linking all forms of suicide terrorism was the way bombers were recruited and trained it is the psychology of the group not the individual that is key
6718859 there are serious flaws in the nss and the approach it embodies but it is a document which offers all things to all readers while being strangely unable to provide much in the way of vision leadership and motivation or strategy in other words the nss refers to the uks core values human rights the rule of law legitimate and accountable government justice freedom tolerance and opportunity for all but these values are mentioned in a strangely passive and defensive way almost as if the most that should be done with these immense ideas is to protect them from marauding terrorists and criminals and of course to stop them being ruined by flood water saddest of all these values appear to constitute little more than the normality to which we are told the governments security strategy will enable us to return as soon as possible after some harm occurs
6718860 so far 200 projects in 70 towns and cities have been funded by whitehall in the attempt to develop the capacity of communities particularly involving muslim women to challenge and resist violent extremists
6718861 but it is still very early days for the police led
6718862 counter terrorism police disrupt 13 terror networks last year from april 2007 until march 2008 over 40 people were convicted of terrorist related offences as a result of metropolitan police investigations and sentences amounting to more than 600 years were imposed the police arrested 46 people in relation to terrorist investigations between the start of this year and may 31 and charged 10 although the report points out that some of the remainder have been cautioned detained pending an immigration investigation or dealt with under the mental health act
6718863 it is extremely difficult for the nationalist tradition to separate out what i might call peacetime britishness from unionist triumphalism just as many unionists find it difficult to separate irish patriotism from at least implied support for the ira i know this sounds piously balanced but i believe it to be the case
6718864 councillor robin newton the dup group leader said that on friday morning the strategic policy and resources committee will discuss the provision of hospitality for members of the armed forces following a homecoming parade to st annes cathedral
6718865 i hope that all committee members will be able to support the civic reception and that t hose who feel they are unable to vote for will at least not vote against the worst thing for the city will be if this issue becomes a political football with the resulting bad feeling that will be generated
6718866 the milieu of terrorists is invariably morally squalid when it is not merely criminal
6718867 the data show that there is little connection between suicide terrorism and islamic fundamentalism or any religion for that matter in fact the leading instigator of suicide attacks is the tamil tigers in sri lanka a marxist leninist group whose members are from hindu families but who are adamantly opposed to religion they have have committed 75 of the 188 incidents
6718868 liberal democracies may be able to resist muslim terrorism but the greatest long running threat to secularism democracy and science could come from within from the emerging coalition of the religious right and the romantic left brought together by a loathing for open society that they share with each other and with osama bin laden
6718869 bombs threaten life and property as would more harmful devices not yet found in the possession of terrorists but that they might conceivably obtain
6718870 we have discovered that state attempts to guarantee fairness through monopoly provision by monolithic public services turns out to be as unfair as previous ideas of 98 tax rates and forced equality of outcome so if monopoly state provision is not the answer what is evidence from around the world shows that just as a broad consensus now exists that we should be free to make our own choices and to innovate in the private sphere so we must trust choice competition in provision and local decision making in public services
6718871 sooner or later there will be a murder of a police officer unless the police are able to deploy ruthlessness in tracking down and wiping out these dissident members
6718872 i believe the community will accept such measures and if dissidents are shot on sight the community will accept that it is a necessary use of lethal force to prevent dissident republicanism from growing
6718873 finally given the seriousness of this most recent murder attempt i believe the stormont executive ought to ensure that a full discussion on the security situation must take place with a view to ensuring every encouragement is given to the police and army in the eradication of dissident republicans

6718968 what do we now i know start a blog vent vent vent vent vent send mission accomplished i dont want to put down the idea of blogs the blog explosion has happened in part because more and more people completely distrust the joke of corporate mcnews

6718976 some foreign entities who are hell bent on creating instability in nigeria in order to play down the growing influence of nigeria in regional and international affairs
6718977 it is nothing but a sinister alarm by some politicians to score a political goal by playing to the gallery
6718978 if there is a coup in the making is the pdp a security agency
6718979 besides we benefit more under a democracy than military rule so we just have no reason to think of a coup we have passed that stage
6718980 it is not true some politicians want to cause instability and benefit by using the military as scapegoat does a political party have the credibility to raise such alarm even if it is true why cant they make official report to government for investigation if they love democracy people should not believe them did they provide any evidence for their alarm
6718981 the president is the commander in chief of the armed forces he has the power to make changes and where they do the new guys need to stabilise sure the retreat will be rescheduled
6718982 we expect him to extend it to all the branches of the military
6718983 weve had our eye on it for a while and we think its a great thing to be taking place here in our area
6718984 dont take this the wrong way lara but you are supremely out of shape
6718985 the legitimate object of government is to do for a community of people whatever they need to have done but can not do for themselves in their separate and individual capacities
6718986 we have to calculate what we want out of state government
6718987 what services do we need then we should determine the cost of those services thats what should determine the state budget
6718988 with unfunded federal mandates like no child left behind more and more of the burden of funding government has been left to the state in new hampshire that ends up coming out of property taxes somethings got to be done
6718989 times are tough but now is not the time to turn our backs on the people
6718990 ignoring things like road repair only comes back to bite us later its the old slogan you can pay me now or you can pay me later
6718991 i was opposed to the ballot measure on the fire stations not because i thought we didnt need them i thought they cost too much thats the kind of scrutiny i want to bring to the state budget when im in concord
6718992 combines the two worst things about america it is violence punctuated by committee meetings
6718993 it wasnt about thinking it was too much or i wasnt capable it was just that when i was playing i was not enjoying it one little bit

6718996 the only thing we have to fear is fear itself
6718997 that was exactly the race plan we wanted that is what we have been working on all year how to race an olympic final

6718999 four years ago i had unfinished business i was good four years ago but i wasnt this good
6719000 the guys at the last olympics deserved to get those medals
6719001 it doesnt really feel real but that was what we have been working towards
6719002 the times when you are absolutely falling to pieces in training this is what it is for and what it has resulted in
6719003 i cannot accept your canon that we are to judge pope and king unlike other men with a favorable presumption that they did no wrong if there is any presumption it is the other way against the holders of power increasing as the power increases historic responsibility has to make up for the want of legal responsibility power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely
6719004 im not into trading favors i never have and i never will
6719005 the schools stare fixedly into the past as we hurtle pell mell into the future
6719006 they are characteristics of the spirit mood language and process of science they are operative wherever evidence of social change can be found
6719007 a new kind of person one who is an actively inquiring flexible creative innovative tolerant liberal personality who can face uncertainty and ambiguity without disorientation who can formulate viable new meanings to meet changes in the environment which threaten individual and mutual survival
6719008 new book out and making the move to open access
6719009 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
6719010 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
6719011 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
6719012 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers
6719013 like everyone he had been taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong something that only pirates would do
6719014 the truth about public service is that its a thankless job

6719023 support is provided with relocation costs and often accommodation is provided for the initial four to eight weeks but schooling and housing allowances are a luxury of the past
6719024 the singapore government has been the frontrunner in the region in terms of building proactive attraction of international talent in the earlier stages of their careers
6719025 in 2007 they introduced what was essentially a newly created visa category to attract young professionals from the asia pacific region who have historically turned to the united kingdom or european markets for international work experience we have yet to see similar changes in hong kong or japan
6719026 the two economies are well equipped with a range of conveniences including short term and long term serviced accommodation and international schools as well as social and business networking groups to help international professionals adjust to life in a new location

6719031 virtualization raises questions of ownership because you separate software from hardware the guy who runs the servers is thinking this infrastructure ive managed my whole career now i dont know which server applications are going to be on which server
6719032 many customers are still in the process of getting comfortable with the notion of virtualization because it staff have very defined roles
6719033 the hypervisor wasnt designed for i o centric software the performance goes down by 60 to 70 percent so just when customers manage to consolidate hardware by virtualizing everything grinds to a halt with these types of software
6719034 most companies have tried virtualization and seen the immediate benefits but they are uncertain about moving forward

6719047 we are deeply concerned at the violence and disruption and at the safety of our employees equipment and investments at the project site at singur
6719048 ut is for the people of west bengal and kolkata to decide whether we are unwanted or accept us as a good corporate citizen
6719049 following which we would have to make a move despite whatever investments had been already made in the project
6719050 there is a sense of tension violence and disruption at singur obviously it is not a conducive atmosphere the compound wall is broken down materials stolen
6719051 whatever be the cost we will move out if the situation demands so
6719052 we are extremely sensitive to the needs of the rural community we have not come to exploit anyone we have got the land on lease and not bought it

6719060 you need to think about your positioning in relation to the speakers
6719061 sit in a comfortable seat without any distractions but most importantly close your eyes your brain becomes much more attuned to what youre hearing if you just focus on the one sense
6719062 you should be able to pick out these details in good recordings
6719063 and when you can it becomes more interesting more entertaining now if you go back to your own music collection youll be able to hear it in new and different ways
6719064 its just that you might not be hearing all the things that were originally put into it
6719065 today its all about convenience rather than quality its about having 1 000 albums in your pocket people have forgotten the benefits of making the act of listening into an event
6719066 id go for a bottom of the range model by a high end speaker company rather than the other way round purely because the quality always filters down through the range and i swear by sennheisers hd600 headphones either at home or in the studio
6719067 the key is to match up all the parts of your system
6719068 if you buy a 600 amplifier theres no point in hooking up 20 speakers to it
6719069 anyone who forks out 6 000 for a cd player is doing it purely for status
6719070 especially so if theyre over 21 as theyll have already lost 20 percent of their hearing theyre not going to appreciate it
6719071 audiophiles have developed incredibly acute some might say irrelevant but certainly very impressive auditory skills they can hear all kinds of details that the rest of us cant its as if theyve taught themselves to become irritated by poor audio quality
6719072 of course not research has shown that a fairly poor auditory signal can trigger the same emotional response and the more familiar you are with the music the lower quality you actually need for your brain to be able to recapture a sense of the original

6719081 the fault was isolated and the aircraft was dispatched for flight

6719113 the early production scheme will be far from the lake and will not affect the fish

6719121 ho parlato con i neurologi che sono stati molto gentili e disponibili con me hanno risposto a tutte le mie domande e mi hanno anche fatto vedere che cosa succede al corpo quando in preda ad un attacco epilettico
6719122 poi ho potuto osservare delle persone in preda agli attacchi e stata una cosa molto difficile e quasi insostenibile ma ero andato l per quel motivo e ho dovuto farlo
6719123 penso che quando era adolescente avesse avuto qualche leggero sintomo di epilessia ma non aveva mai avuto un vero attacco

6719130 we want everyone to know the truth about the terrible events in tskhinvali with the hope that such a thing will never again happen on our land
6719131 its important that glitter comes back here and that hes carefully risk assessed here in the u s where we can do that
6719132 its important that we stop him traveling overseas again where he is a known risk of abusing children
6719133 we are here so that the world will know the truth
6719134 we have to remember those who died the tragic death from georgian aggression
6719135 there are cases of putting on fire houses by the georgian special command
6719136 that is their word as you know georgians are very good at provocations
6719137 the georgians or anyone who would do this are not human
6719138 i only have one favor to ask everyone who comes here
6719139 do not leave even one georgian kitten living among us because the day after it will become a tiger
6719140 after they blew everything up they shouted come out and raise your hands and we wont hurt you
6719141 this is for the heroes killed on their own land by the bloody aggressors

6719153 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6719154 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6719155 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6719156 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6719157 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6719158 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6719159 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6719160 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6719161 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6719162 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6719163 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

6719173 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo

6719177 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible

6719185 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6719186 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6719187 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6719188 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6719189 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6719190 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6719191 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6719192 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6719193 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6719194 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6719195 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6719196 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6719197 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6719198 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6719199 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana

6719201 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6719202 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6719203 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6719204 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6719205 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
6719206 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
6719207 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6719208 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6719209 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6719210 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6719211 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6719212 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6719213 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
6719214 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6719215 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6719216 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6719217 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6719218 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6719219 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6719220 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6719221 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6719222 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6719223 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6719224 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad

6719226 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6719227 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6719228 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6719229 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6719230 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6719231 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6719232 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos

6719250 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6719251 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6719252 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo

6719276 sorry but i really wont be able to make it to the party tonight no matter how many fig leaves i wear
6719277 crikey sue that sounds bad what is it are you very ill can i do anything is it contagious
6719278 dont worry its not catching and its not going to kill me it doesnt sound so scary when its called prickly heat
6719279 ill be really embarrassed with everyone looking at it and they will if im wearing nothing but three fig leaves
6719280 well just wear more leaves ill see you at seven thirty just like we agreed
6719281 well you ring up jezzer and see if theres anything hes found out that will make you feel better and ill stick some more leaves onto your outfit
6719282 you told me that mandy was going as a baywatch babe but wont go without you of course youve got to come
6719283 itchy is there anything i can do to stop that
6719284 yes ive been reading up on the subject since i heard you had it usually the problem will clear up quickly without any treatment but calamine lotion would probably be soothing if the itching is very bad or you could ask the pharmacy for some 1 hydrocortisone cream to reduce the inflamation the best thing seems to be to stay cool and avoid sweating you could take a cold shower and then dress in loose clothes and stay in a cool place
6719285 a shower sounds like a great idea thanks jez ill try that right away
6719286 that would be a shame i was really looking forward to seeing you
6719287 why dont you keep as cool as you can until its time to go and then wear cool clothing cotton is best apparently we could stay in the garden most of the evening and if you dont feel well id be happy to bring you home at any time
6719288 so when you looked up about my miliaria did you find out what caused it
6719289 miliaria can develop in anyone at any age but is most common in children and babies as their sweat glands are immature so more likely to become blocked another cause is people travelling to somewhere hot and sweating more than usual
6719290 hmmm ive started cycling recently and i wear lots of clothes as its cold in the mornings but i get sweaty on the way maybe thats caused it
6719291 its possible miliaria can occur whenever sweating is a problem for example if someone is ill and lies on their back for a long time they might get it on their back
6719292 you can help by trying to avoid getting hot and stay out of humid places even staying in a cool place for a few hours a day can help using an antibacterial soap or antiseptic wash might reduce the bacteria on your skin down that seem to be responsible moisturisers containing anhydrous lanolin can help to prevent blockage of the sweat ducts the main thing though is to keep cool why dont you sit out in the garden and ill bring you a nice cold drink
6719293 miliaria rubra thats the most common type of miliaria theres one called miliaria crystallina the rash is clear in that one because the blockage is nearer the surface its not serious theres a worse type called milliaria profunda in that one the rash is deeper into the skin and its more serious
6719294 with that one or the one you have its possible that because you cant sweat properly you could develop a fever or heat exhaustion thats only likely if the rash covers a large part of your body and you dont cool down i think youll be fine but of course if you felt unwell you should see a doctor
6719295 perhaps youd like to come for a drive then my car has air conditioning
6719296 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered

6719311 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6719312 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6719313 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6719314 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo

6719316 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6719317 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano

6719331 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6719332 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6719333 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6719334 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6719335 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6719336 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6719337 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe

6719340 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6719341 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6719342 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6719343 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6719344 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6719345 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6719346 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6719347 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6719348 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6719349 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6719350 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6719351 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6719352 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6719353 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6719354 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6719355 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6719356 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6719357 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6719358 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6719359 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6719360 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6719361 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6719362 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6719363 when we got up to eight or nine in the later part of july thats when we started asking health units could you go back and get us some more information
6719364 theres been some sort of failure to communicate in a timely manner so that the public could be made aware so that we could make the choices to make ourselves safe
6719365 the information i have is that if theyre leaving it is at a snails pace

6719369 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6719370 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6719371 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6719372 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6719373 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6719374 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6719375 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6719376 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6719377 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6719378 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6719379 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6719380 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6719381 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6719382 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6719383 any voltage measured at vout is equal to the common mode voltage at the input of the amplifier
6719384 menckens famous bathtub hoax was an invented history of the bathtub designed to appeal to what readers wanted to believe about the ignorance and irrationality of people in the past he published it as a demonstration of human credulity reported with glee on how many people repeated it as gospel despite its obvious inconsistency with easily established historical facts published multiple retractions pointing out how obviously false it was and by his account never managed to kill the story
6719385 even the customs guards in communist china were professional and polite in a bored way compared to almost every american security or customs official ive encountered travel agents up here in canada say that one of the most common requests they hear is how do i avoid making a connection in the u s going through an american aiport is like being processed through a prison or an animal stockyard and feder is correct one of the most unsettling aspects is that american guards are not just doing a job they seem to be emotionally invested in it and swollen with an arrogant enjoyment of authority which is not to excuse those security agents who are just doing a job you do not escape responsibility for brutalizing someone just because you are being paid to do so

6719405 i just hope my blogs dont fall into the unacceptable category of really bloody boring
6719406 i feel revolting no one is going to marry me now
6719407 ive been preparing for this eventuality now for the best part of 18 months ive led a decent life seen a lot of the world and been in a job ive enjoyed as for dying how can anyone be scared of something that is going to happen to every single one of us
6719408 i had this overwhelming sense of panic and deep breathing it was so strange
6719409 i firmly believe that if our young adults are given all the facts about these important issues many more will go on to become donors themselves

6719473 twitter represents a change in communication by acting as a global gateway for updates via sms or the web that then updates all of your followers twitter succeeded in breaking ground in one to many messaging there have been a couple times over the past year where twitter was used in africa to get news out that wasnt possible in any other format in areas like africa where mobile phone penetration far outstrips internet penetration twitter ends up being an incredibly good way to update friends family or in the case of businesses and government the general public about things that are happening
6719474 the frog definitely was real and is somewhere out in my yard at least thats where i last saw him with all the flooding we have had in iowa this summer there has been an explosion of these small frogs in yards i noticed them jumping out of the way of the lawn mower one afternoon so when i finished mowing i thought i would try to photograph some of them i set this little guy on a flower growing alongside our house he struck this pose and in the next instant he was gone

6719479 coaching in the final yesterday it was so good for my heart that so many people are engaged in womens soccer
6719480 if you looked at the quality of the game and the excitement it had everything extra time that game was not only good for the usa but it was good for womens soccer overall
6719481 womens football is improving all the time and its getting tighter and tighter so now you have a handful of teams that can win the olympics and the world cup and thats really good for womens soccer overall
6719482 things are going to happen we are going to get beat every once in a while by these guys there are just way too good but we knew that we couldnt get down on ourselves and i think that confidence throughout all our games got us to where we are now
6719483 later on in the game especially when it went into overtime we could tell by their body language that they were really tired so that we knew that we had to take advantage of that
6719484 it says a lot about the team that we were able to come back after the opening norway loss here and after a huge devastating loss at the world cup last year and losing some players as well

6719521 everyone knows how difficult the mortgage market is currently but at simplybiz we continue to buck the trend as broker firms appreciate the value that we can offer in these difficult times our professional approach to service and leading procuration rates provide the value added package they are looking for from a leading player
6719522 the consumer lending market has moved beyond recognition lending markets are currently beset by high market uncertainties with the ongoing credit crunch falling house prices rising arrears and repossessions and indebted consumers struggling to find credit
6719523 in the past when borrowing was cheap and easy and the rise of the housing market seemed unstoppable work for the building and construction trades was plentiful but for those who relied on this trend continuing and lived beyond their means the downturn we see today has left them high and dry
6719524 theres been a lot of talk about the credit crunch over the past year but i would say its only now that the effects are really hitting their target and ordinary workers and business owners are taking the blows
6719525 anyone finding their mortgage repayments a real struggle should remember final repossession is a long process and lenders have a regulatory requirement to act sympathetically towards borrowers experiencing financial hardship
6719526 an interesting battle is now underway between the government and the fsa who are putting pressure on lenders to take a soft line on repossessions and the lenders and cml who are mindful of the need to manage their arrears book and deliver for shareholders
6719527 the most surprising aspect of this research is the proportion of people aged between 35 and 54 who expect their parents to provide financial support when things get tough you might expect people in this age bracket to be financially self sufficient
6719528 the problem is that the parents of these people will either be in or approaching retirement and may well be facing the fact that their own incomes are much reduced

6719582 at first there was a sort of rivalry between the two of us and pat
6719583 it was always a friendly rivalry as we have been friends and playing soccer together since we were really young
6719584 we ended up not liking keene and pat put it in our heads that plymouth was a fun school the guys on the team were great and the coach was a good guy
6719585 george and i both talked to the plymouth coach and the next year we went to plymouth we never really planned in high school to go to the same college it just kind of happened
6719586 the three of us together is great because we know each others play styles very well so we mesh well
6719587 i think all three of us are aware its our last year so theres a lot of incentive to have a good season
6719588 in fact we have a very old team altogether so we all want this season to be a great one the ncaa tournament is the goal so we need to win the little east conference
6719589 it was more than what i expected i expected it to be fun but it was more than fun
6719590 everything about the country was great the lifestyle the people the soccer it was just amazing how much they love soccer over there
6719591 on our way to practice or games there would be people of all age groups playing soccer and if they werent playing they had a soccer ball in their hands
6719592 its not about nice cleats or a nice field in argentina
6719593 its all about the love of the game everyone was everywhere playing streets dirt driveways parks there were people playing
6719594 we were on our way back from a late match against river plate intramural and it was about 12 30 at night and every park was filled with teams and people training it was unbelievable
6719595 i would say that what was the most impressive is how much they love futbol
6719596 the level of play was very different from what im used to
6719597 they possessed the ball very well the playing was way more physical than here in the states
6719598 a rule that we learned really quick was the high kick or the dangerous play rule they dont have that in argentina its just a rule here in the states so high kicks close to your face are legal as well as playing the ball while youre on the ground that was hard to cope with
6719599 they were the best team we played we were nervous and getting used to the style of play we had our chances missing two breakaways and i had a shot outside the 18 that hit the crossbar but it was a good wake up of what we were up against
6719600 the next game we played against river plate intramural they were a great team as well we played under the lights turf field in river plate stadium grounds
6719601 our last match was against club atletico atlanta an argentine b division professional team
6719602 they had three players who played matches in the professional league and we tied them 2 2
6719603 they were a quick team i would say the fastest pace team we played
6719604 our tour guide got us tickets at the last minute and it was awesome
6719605 i came back to school to start soccer on august 8 and we have been going full steam ever since
6719606 moving up to division i is definitely going to be a challenge for us but were extremely excited and believe in ourselves and each other that we will be successful
6719607 unfortunately because we are not yet official members of the nec northeast conference we are not allowed to compete for a championship
6719608 but we are excited for the chance to get our name out there and show whats in store for the upcoming years
6719609 moving up to division i is a five year process to be officially titled division i
6719610 last year was our transitional phase so this year is declared the first year of the complete transition
6719611 there are numerous factors that go into the decision to move up with a major one being the desire for bryant to increase diversity and enrollment by expanding out of new england and catching interest in other areas
6719612 as far as athletics go the sports teams have done exceptionally well in the northeast 10 conference which is the hardest division ii conference with many teams getting a bid into the ncaa tournament
6719613 last year was our most successful year as we had an undefeated conference season only to lose in the conference final but making it to the second round of the ncaa and finishing with a 17 2 5 record
6719614 the difference between high school and college soccer is huge
6719615 in high school the competition is not always the best your team consists of players of all different levels and it really doesnt matter whether you had a bad game or not
6719616 in college it is the complete opposite you are playing with extremely talented players from all different states in a league where less talented teams do not exist
6719617 the intensity pace of the game talent of your teammates and opponents and commitment is incomparable to what you face in high school
6719618 i have really enjoyed myself at bryant the past two years and am really looking forward to my senior year
6719619 ive been through many changes since my transition from west point after my freshman year and am extremely happy i ended up where i am now
6719620 i have met some unbelievable people as well as been fortunate enough to be a part of a team whom i consider my family away from home
6719621 i truly love the game and wish to never have to give it up but i will instead be switching my focus to working on getting my professional career in order although i wont be playing competitively anymore i definitely plan to stay involved in the sport for many years to come through the various womens leagues and summer leagues in the area
6719622 as far as soccer goes we are very aware that this transition will be a challenge for us
6719623 we are moving into unfamiliar territory as far as not having played these teams before and not knowing what exactly to expect but we are confident in our ability as a team to be able to compete at this higher level
6719624 every year during preseason we establish team goals that we aim to achieve after each game and by the end of the season so if we continue to improve game by game then we will know that we have been successful in meeting our end of season goals
6719625 we lost in the semifinals of the conference my sophomore year and lost in the final my junior year so it was disappointing for us not to be able to get that last chance at winning the title so instead because it is our last year we are going to focus on doing the best we can to compete and do well in order to help pave the way for our underclassmen to be successful in the future

6719649 i didnt see the ghost until a couple of days later when i was looking at the pictures on the computer i thought it was really weird because it really looks like theres a ghost in the picture

6719654 and then it was the end and that was the first show done
6719655 so it all passed in a bit of a blur
6719656 i took a decision when i had my children to stop going on the road having been a reporter on the road for 10 years
6719657 so this is the first time ive really gone back and done it
6719658 when i had a current affairs show i used to travel quite a bit but not as regularly as this
6719659 but when im doing a show im only away for a night so i have two very long days

6719670 neither of us started well and we used to say we wanted to leave
6719671 we can laugh about it now because we have both reached 100 games
6719672 i am really pleased i have worked hard to achieve that and i would like to play many more games for united
6719673 it surprised me in fact i think it has come as a surprise to everyone
6719674 it is not often a player leaves one big club to go to another like arsenal or liverpool it does not tend to happen
6719675 but mikael did not play much last year and i think he just wanted to go somewhere where he would
6719676 he has been here a long time and he still deserves to play at the highest level
6719677 mikael has given so much to this club i am just surprised he is going to arsenal but he has made the choice and i am happy for him

6719682 theres no doubt that were going to see more and more hd 4850s with aftermarket cooling hit the market the palit is a nice little option that comes with a decent cooler which helps keeps temps down whilst offering a decent overclock on the core we dont doubt performance could have been better with other brands seeing as high as 2200mhz ddr on the memory palit have chosen to keep things more conservative this time around leaving the memory at an even 2000mhz ddr which results in a very small overclock the good thing about palit is the aggressive pricing which means you can actually get your hands on one of these cards for similar prices or sometimes cheaper than what some brands charge for the stock model which makes it quite an attractive purchase overall the card gives us a nice little boost in performance while also managing to keep those pesky temps at bay when compared to what the stock cooler does we would have liked to have seen a bit more done with the memory clock though to help it stand out a little bit more in the performance department
6719683 if president mugabe goes ahead to convene parliament appoint a new cabinet it means he is proceeding to violate the conditions of the mou which means he may have abandoned the basis for the talks but we dont know what his intentions are
6719684 a violation of the mou will have to be dealt with by the mediator
6719685 president mugabe will not proceed to do anything unilaterally any steps that we take have to be by consensus
6719686 this is where an executive president has executive power and an executive prime minister has executive power and they have to share this power and they have to make decisions between themselves
6719687 some of them by consensus so that no one feels that they have been booted out of holding executive authority

6719708 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
6719709 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
6719710 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6719711 the chinese government and the chinese athletes must be respected

6719714 for the time being there is nothing i can add
6719715 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6719716 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
6719717 so we have sent a letter to the ioc and to the international federation asking them to review the matter and see if they cant resolve it for the good of the competition the integrity of the competition and the good of all the athletes
6719718 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6719719 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here

6719745 if she was serious she would not have pressed the emergency button
6719746 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6719747 this agreement determines the principal provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of u s forces
6719748 i have to say if i could just make the point the reason we are where we are going talking about this kind of agreement is that the surge worked iraqi forces have demonstrated that they are strong and getting stronger
6719749 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this

6719758 in both theory and practice the portfolio with the widest diversification will have the lowest risk the optimum equity portfolio is the whole market its the one with the highest return per unit of risk anything less than the global portfolio is a bet against the efficient market and subjects an investor to uncompensated risk
6719759 diversification is protection against ignorance it makes very little sense for those who know what theyre doing
6719760 the average person can concentrate on a few good companies while the fund manager is forced to diversify by owning too many stocks you lose this advantage of concentration it only takes a handful of big winners to make a lifetime of investing worthwhile
6719761 its best to own as many stocks as there are situations in which a youve got an edge and b youve uncovered an exciting prospect that passes all the tests of research
6719762 theres no use diversifying into unknown companies just for the sake of diversity a foolish diversity is the hobgoblin of small investors

6719838 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6719839 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it

6719841 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6719842 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6719843 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6719844 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6719845 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely

6719857 we still are not big enough in five to 10 years to do it on our own i believe it will be sooner rather than later
6719858 i am not saying there is anybody out there at the moment
6719859 all i am saying is that many airlines are now merging in situations where they probably would not have considered it three or four or even five years ago

6719879 the trick with wireless power is not can you do it its can you do it safely and efficiently
6719880 it turns out the human body is not affected by magnetic fields it is affected by elective fields so what we are doing is transmitting energy using the magnetic field not the electric field
6719881 initially it eliminates chargers and eventually it eliminates batteries altogether
6719882 that is potentially a world changing event this is the closest weve had to something being commercially available in this class
6719883 its great that we have wireless email and wireless internet and stuff like that but at the end of the day it would be nice to have wireless recharge as well

6719900 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6719901 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6719902 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6719903 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6719904 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6719905 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6719906 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6719907 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6719908 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6719909 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6719910 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6719911 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6719912 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6719913 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6719914 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6719915 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6719916 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6719917 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6719918 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6719919 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6719920 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6719921 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6719922 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

6719942 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes

6719948 15 prozent am wahltag w re f r die sozis noch zu viel
6719949 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6719950 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6719951 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6719952 surprisingly robust in the first quarter but weakened sharply during the second quarter
6719953 continue to switch to the back of the aircraft or onto economy only services
6719954 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6719955 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6719956 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6719957 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6719958 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6719959 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6719960 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6719961 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6719962 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6719963 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6719964 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others

6719989 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6719990 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
