4120000 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4120001 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4120002 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4120003 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4120004 la posici n israel es clara igual que el establecimiento del estado jud o en 1948 solucion el problema de los refugiados jud os el establecimiento de un estado palestino que viva en paz al lado de israel proveer la soluci n para los refugiados palestinos
4120005 los refugiados palestinos deber n regresar a palestina y no a israel
4120006 olmert ha propuesto a ab s que israel absorba 2 000 refugiados palestinos por a o durante los pr ximos diez a os
4120007 israel de momento no ha puesto ninguna oferta concreta sobre la mesa
4120008 la olp nunca podr aceptar un pacto que no incluya el reconocimiento del principio de retorno de los refugiados palestinos de acuerdo con el derecho internacional y con lo conversado en todos los procesos negociadores anteriores
4120009 there are planning considerations to weigh up because 500 hectares isnt nothing
4120010 what do you have to say about people commenting on your sisters implants
4120011 it made me feel a bit sick to my stomach
4120012 but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given
4120013 nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
4120014 we have been under siege for the last two years
4120015 the only thing left is for them to invade and kill us
4120016 if the cease fire is just a front for extremists in gaza to rearm and regroup of course we have the right to act
4120017 any arms buildup is a direct violation of the calm that was achieved
4120018 they control the gaza strip with quite an iron fist if you dont mind me saying and none of this activity with the other groups would be happening unless hamas was complicit and allowing it to happen

4120021 i cant believe that time i am really happy with it its going to be a good race on saturday
4120022 it went really quick the gold has given me confidence anything is possible i am hoping for another medal
4120023 the first 400m felt really good but then i just kind of didnt have much left at the end
4120024 by the 500 i was struggling sometimes your body just doesnt work and my body chose a really bad time to not work
4120025 i was putting in great practices every day the best ones of my life every single day i really felt amazing and then suddenly towards the end of singapore something changed
4120026 i dont know what it was whether it was nerves building up but i just didnt have it
4120027 i dont think many people would have bet on katie not getting through
4120028 let me take this opportunity to reiterate my governments commitment to improve relations with india by resolving all outstanding disputes between the two countries in a just and peaceful manner
4120029 the world must open its eyes to the plight of us tibetans rather than focusing on the beijing olympics
4120030 i will continue to protest unless china guarantees human rights in tibet
4120031 1 068 tibetan protesters have been rounded up from around the protest site they will be released later this evening
4120032 they kept on coming so we continued detaining them because they were in a place where protests are prohibited
4120033 we have totally reclaimed the villages occupied by rebels but troops are still clearing the areas of land mines left behind by the milf forces
4120034 cest le gouvernement sud africain qui nous avait invit s et avait pay s les billets
4120035 my whole thing is that that i saw the dark knight i feel like im dumb because i feel like i dont get how many things that are so smart its like a ferrari engine of storytelling and script writing and im like thats not my idea of what i want to see in a movie i loved the prestige but didnt understand the dark knight didnt get it still cant tell you what happened in the movie what happened to the character and in the end they need him to be a bad guy im like i get it this is so high brow and so f king smart i clearly need a college education to understand this movie you know what f ck dc comics thats all i have to say and thats where im really coming from
4120036 a sudden and drastic reduction in the availability of credit
4120037 the distance travelled from the place where food is produced to the place where it is eaten considered in terms of the environmental damage that transporting it entails
4120038 a tax imposed with the intention of discouraging activities that may damage the environment
4120039 a small scale environmentally friendly settlement designed for sustainable living
4120040 the impact of human activity measured in terms of the amount of carbon dioxide it causes to be emitted into the atmosphere
4120041 the temporary failure of an item of clothing to do its job in covering a part of the body that it would be advisable to keep covered
4120042 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4120043 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4120044 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4120045 the public prosecution service and the police worked together with kaspersky lab on this case with full contentment
4120046 the nurburgring is a new circuit for me ive been there before as a spectator but never to drive so thats exciting as well in fact its going to be a weekend of firsts my first race with creation first in an lmp1 car and first at the nurburgring so obviously i cant wait
4120047 this 2008 democratic national convention will make history in so many ways and our commitment to making this the greenest convention ever is no exception
4120048 camco a world renowned pioneer in the sustainability field will help us make good on that goal by turning climate change liabilities into environmental assets
4120049 i am delighted that camco will be working with the democratic national convention committee to quantify and reduce the conventions impact on the climate and help to raise awareness of this urgent global issue
4120050 this project is a prime example of how camco is leading the way in helping north americas emissions intensive industry and public sector develop and implement practical strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
4120051 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4120052 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4120053 a military outfit across the country has a contract they want filled that requires knowledge of such systems
4120054 being one of the last people with experience in this area that doesnt already have a well paid job i get snapped up by one of the bidders on this contract in order to fill the role of on site consultant for the contract
4120055 the client specifically does not want an on site consultant the whole purpose of the contract being to avoid such a position
4120056 i sort of stay at the head office lost and unassigned but for some reason still employed i have no idea what happened to the people responsible for the whole fiasco
4120057 truly white hat as i am then continue on that way take time out to examine the posts from some of those who have been penalised most admittedly not all claim to be white hat but in fact have been using some incredibly stupid seo techniques
4120058 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4120059 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4120155 global warming is a reality but what our data shows is that climate science is complex and that it is wrong to take particular events and link them to co 2 emissions these records will give us a much clearer picture of what is really happening

4120157 the polarisation of wealth across the age groups and the significant increase in consumer debt levels spurred by a growing divide between house prices and household income levels has resulted in an increase in the number of australian households at risk of mortgage default

4120173 we welcome the people and the colleagues of the olympic games with us and we welcome suggestions that are constructive advice from these people all kinds of peoples but the foreign press you come here to pick critically dig into details but that doesnt mean we dont fulfil on our promises i did not say china would promise to do whatever i did say the games would open up the horizons of china

4120192 the bank took the view that it had to take measures to stop inflation going higher the aim was to slow down demand to make it harder for businesses to widen their margins and to force businesses to start cutting their margins again that has happened thats been successful
4120193 we set out to bring inflation back to the target range and we are confident that we are on that path and thats why we are in a position to respond on interest rates

4120238 it was a dark and stormy night the rain fell in torrents except at occasional intervals when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets for it is in london that our scene lies rattling along the housetops and fiercely agitating the scanty flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness

4120253 god doesnt respond to what we do we respond to what god does our lives get in step with god and all others by letting him set the pace not by proudly or anxiously trying to run the parade
4120254 if abraham by what he did for god got god to approve him he could certainly have taken credit for it but the story were given is a god story not an abraham story abraham entered into what god was doing for him and that was the turning point he trusted god to set him right instead of trying to be right on his own
4120255 but if you see that the job is too big for you and that its something only god can do and you trust him to do it you could never do it for yourself no matter how hard and how long you worked well that trusting him to do it is what gets you set right with god by god
4120256 we call abraham our faith father because god made something out of abraham when he was a nobody it was because he dared to trust god to do what only god could do raise the dead to life with a word make something out of nothing when everything was hopeless abraham believed anyway deciding to live not on the basis of what he saw he couldnt do but on what god said he would do abraham didnt focus on his own impotence and say its hopeless nor did he survey and give up he didnt tiptoe around gods promise asking cautiously skeptical questions he plunged into the promise and and came up strong ready for god sure that god would make good on what he had said
4120257 we throw open our doors to god and discover at the same moment that he had already thrown open his door to us we find ourselves standing where we always hoped we might stand out in the wide open spaces of gods grace and glory standing tall and shouting our praise we continue to shout our praise even when were hemmed in with troubles because we know how troubles can develop passionate patience in us and how that patience in turn forges the tempered steel of virtue keeping us alert for whatever god will do next in alert expectancy such as this were never left feeling shortchanged quite the contrary we cant round up enough containers to hold everything god generously pours into our lives through the holy spirit christ arrives right on time to make this happen he didnt and doesnt wait for us to get ready
4120258 god is strong and he wants you strong so take everything the master has set out for you well made weapons of the best materials and put them to use so you will be able to stand up to everything the devil throws your way this is no afternoon athletic contest that well walk away from and forget about in a couple of hours this is for keeps a life or death fight to the finish against the devil and all his angels be prepared youre up against far more than you can handle on your own take all the help you can get every weapon god has issued so what when its all over but the shouting youll still be on your feet gods word is an indispensable weapon in the same way prayer is essential in this outgoing warfare pray hard and long pray for your brothers and sisters keep your eyes open keep each others spirits up so that no one falls behind or drops out

4120282 the three parks being opened is based on the constitution of china that people are allowed to demonstrate if they have some issues
4120283 i think thats one step further for china to open up and i think its very good gesture
4120284 in china nobody will be persecuted or placed under house arrest because of their speech only those who break laws will be punished in accordance with the law
4120285 chinese citizens in accordance with the law enjoy the freedom of speech and other kinds of rights and freedoms
4120286 its clear to us that the protest zones are just a cynical public relations ploy on the part of the chinese authorities
4120287 we can see that the petitioners who made this attempt to speak have now suffered the consequences
4120288 sadly i think the protest zones are just a trap at some level
4120289 it is imperative that we gain rapid access to south ossetia so that we can bring urgent help to those in need

4120304 i understand they have put puryear in the controversial category
4120305 its very rare for a district court nominee to become controversial usually they just fly through
4120306 groups can attack a nominee but youll never see the nominee respond to anything except at hearings
4120307 as far as his qualifications go he was at the top of his class in law school he clerked on the u s court of appeals he has legislative experience in the u s senate he manages litigation for a big fortune 500 company and the aba american bar association rated him as qualified
4120308 gus realizes this is a lame duck year in politics
4120309 its true for all nominees whether youre in the deal or not is beyond your control

4120327 this tells us that sleeps role in emotional memory preservation is more than just mechanistic
4120328 in order to preserve what it deems most important the brain makes a tradeoff strengthening the memorys emotional core and obscuring its neutral background
4120329 emotional memories usually contain highly charged elements for example the car that sideswiped us on the ride home along with other elements that are only tangentially related to the emotion such as the name of the street we were traveling on or what store wed just passed
4120330 we were interested in examining whether sleep would affect memory for all of these elements equally or whether sleep might allow some of the event features to decay at a faster rate than others
4120331 our results revealed that the study subjects who stayed awake all day largely forgot the entire negative scene they had seen with their memories of both the central objects and the backgrounds decaying at similar rates
4120332 after an evening of sleep the subjects remembered the emotional items smashed car as accurately as the subjects whose memories had been tested only 30 minutes after looking at the scenes
4120333 by contrast sleep did little to preserve memory for the backgrounds i e street scenes and so memory for those elements reached a comparably low level after a night of sleep as it did after a day spent awake
4120334 this is consistent with the possibility that the individual components of emotional memory become unbound during sleep
4120335 you might say that sleep is actually working at night to decide what memories to hold on to and what to let go of
4120336 recently i visited alcatraz prison once it housed the most hardened of criminals today it is open to tourists under the direction of the united states parks department many men have tried to escape alcatraz no one is known to have succeeded as i listened to the tour guide explain the impossibility of escape i thought of other prisons equally confining but where the doors are never locked no guards walk the halls and escape is encouraged and possible that prison is habit

4120351 solvit makes sintef and ntnu able to consolidate the position as europes leading science cluster for co 2 management the programme includes building a large laboratory facility that will strengthen our standing in the international arena and improve our position in competition for financial support for scientific research from institutions such as the european union
4120352 results from the development research in the new laboratory in trondheim will be tried out in test centres and hopefully also in full scale facilities already in the first phase of the programme this makes solvit even more exciting
4120353 we have a clear goal to bring the cost of co 2 capture and cleansing down significantly in phase two and three of solvit the parties will try to introduce new chemical solutions and elements to the process in order to generate cost cuts the aim is to come up with a process facility for co 2 capture that can operate on half the energy consumption of todays processes

4120357 i see him all the time at least once a week we still have feelings for each other i still love him and i think he loves me
4120358 we were both really attracted to each other he totally instigated it and pursued me his friends would tell me that he liked me that he thought i was pretty

4120360 kelli and casey have been a couple on and off for a few years they were a really tight couple but i think it was hard for kelli having jamie lynn in the picture
4120361 it happened very casually he came by the house and i went off with him in his car and had sex
4120362 like a dagger going through my heart it hurt so bad he casey thought she was just saying she was pregnant to get him back because at that point they were broken up once again he told me it wasnt true and not to worry
4120363 at no point did he say kelli shes pregnant we cant do this anymore its not right we would hang out and hook up have sex i dont know where jamie lynn thought he was he probably said he was just going out with the guys but really he was coming to be with me
4120364 he had to deal with the baby coming and it had to stop but even after we stopped having sex we would still kiss occasionally
4120365 i think that he is trapped when i see jamie lynn doing interviews and talking about how happy she is with casey it seems so fake shes trying to paint a pretty picture but its messy art i want the best for him aldridge i would never trap him into a life with me i would want casey to be with me for the right reasons because he wanted to
4120366 based on our study of the enamel of these neanderthal teeth and other modern ones we cant support the claim that neanderthals grew up more quickly than do modern humans
4120367 we chose these three groups since they would provide a good cross section of various populations from different regions of the world
4120368 we feel that they give us some insights into the variation that exists within modern humans
4120369 the missing key bit of data to show that would be evidence for when the first molar tooth erupted in the neanderthals and we simple have no evidence of when that occurred
4120370 the question is when exactly did that pattern of development evolve in the growth of humans
4120371 grooves formed by the passage of a pointed object which confirms the use of a small stick for cleaning the mouth
4120372 there are two teeth perfectly preserved in which the wear and tear of a human of about 30 years old is perceptible

4120419 the days of mike bassett england manager are a thing of the past writing your team on the back of a fag packet
4120420 that is a stereotypical manager of the 60s or 70s although i dont know because i wasnt around
4120421 arsene wenger is the total opposite to that he is very studious very thoughtful and a very clever man
4120422 his football teams should be an inspiration to people who want their teams to entertain
4120423 teams like arsenal are always open to criticism if they dont win anything as happened last season
4120424 but from my perspective as a football fan they are still a joy to watch
4120425 and in my eyes he is up there in terms of changing the face of english football over the last 20 years by creating teams that are a joy to watch george graham won the championship but wenger has put arsenal year in year out at the top end of the premier league and the perception i have is that he hasnt spent anywhere near the money of a manchester united or a chelsea might have done
4120426 he seems to have everything boxed off like his scouting system and his greater vision of where the club are going
4120427 he has gone down that route of setting up scouting systems in west africa like ivory coast and cameroon and places like that and bringing young players into europe and putting them into his team
4120428 those players didnt cost 20m or 30m and yet they play in a team who finish in the top four every year and compete to win the premier league every year
4120429 i keep saying that i want us to be recognised for the achievements weve had and we deserve to be in the premier league
4120430 im not buying into the theory of us just going out and enjoying the day
4120431 as i said last year when we played portsmouth in the fa cup we have to try to be competitive and try to win the match
4120432 we will go there and try to be as competitive as we can
4120433 i can have respect for the manager and for the club but ultimately were going there to try to get a result and do what is best for albion
4120434 ultimately somewhere down the line we want can get to level where teams see us as a big game to play and a big fish to try to beat
4120435 youre essentially buying vista but getting xp for free and obtaining an upgrade disk for vista when and if you want it if you buy the vista business edition models and makers that support this option will impose no additional charge if you buy a cheaper vista version you may have to pay additional fees or an xp downgrade may not be available
4120436 if youre upgrading computers and your new machine uses more energy than your old one youre increasing your so called carbon footprint but a system that meets energy star guidelines at least increases your power use less than does a comparable system that hasnt been designed to meet the marks of this environmental protection agency program
4120437 energy star shouldnt be the deciding factor but its worth crunching numbers with your local electrical rates against other models youd be considering
4120438 every computer maker should offer the option to provide a computer with no comarketed preinstalled software packages that generally serve more to slow down your new systems performance than to enhance your computing experience yes antivirus and firewall software trials can make sure youre safe out of the box but this is also a lock in strategy with marketing dollars involved not something that has your interests directly at heart
4120439 we are pleased to add a veteran player with mos talents and experience to our squad
4120440 he is a quality defender who gives us a physical and athletic presence whether its serving as a starter or coming off the bench we are getting a solid player who is coming off his best statistical season and who also has the talents to spread things on offense with his three point shooting ability

4120450 dear logical person i will not leave rogers before my contract expires because i do not want to pay a 400 early contract cancellation fee i will not give those bastards an extra cent if i dont have to

4120457 it could turn into a fuel mileage race at any time so you really have to be on your toes and be aware of what could happen
4120458 we were pretty good there in the spring race but came up short on the fuel mileage at the end
4120459 it cost us a certain top five finish we should be able to take what we learned back there and have another strong run hopefully this time we wont get burned on the fuel mileage
4120460 for me coming to michigan i tend to run well here for whatever reason and the biggest deal is trying to finish and finish up front
4120461 we ran toward the front there in june but we ended up making a late pit stop and with all the fuel mileage strategy that was going on we ended up getting shuffled back
4120462 weve had some great runs with the car that we are bringing this weekend so im hoping we can improve on our june finish
4120463 michigan is one of those places that you need the entire package to compete for the win
4120464 being successful has a lot do with the horsepower that is under the hood
4120465 ever since i was a youth ive always been searching for the truth
4120466 this grass sure is wet how did it get wet
4120467 oh thats the water from the air its called dew remember the three phases of water
4120468 and theres one more can you remember it its water in the air
4120469 well not actually sweat doesnt come from the air it comes from inside our bodies in our skin we have these little things called sweat glands and when we get hot they put water from inside our bodies on our skin to cool us off our dog doesnt have any sweat glands thats why when she gets hot she sticks out her tongue and cools herself off that way
4120470 they sure look like they do dont they whats that called
4120471 actually water bottles only look like they sweat thats the water from the air the water as gas turns into the liquid water on the outside of the bottle
4120472 so you have water the liquid water the solid ice and you can see proof that the invisible water in the air is there because its like sweat on the outside of the water bottle
4120473 you are my beloved son with you i am well pleased

4120518 unintelligent men who do not know me perfectly think that i the supreme personality of godhead krishna was impersonal before and have now assumed this personality due to their small knowledge they do not know my higher nature which is imperishable and supreme

4120521 even if it were possible to count the atoms after smashing the earth into powder still it would not be possible to estimate the unfathomable transcendental qualities of the lord
4120522 the supreme lord has nothing to do and no one is found to be equal to or greater than him for everything is done naturally and systematically by his multifarious energies
4120523 that supreme abode of mine is not illumined by the sun or moon nor by fire or electricity those who reach it never return to this material world
4120524 completely rejecting all religious activities which are materially motivated this srimad bhagavatam propounds the highest truth which is understandable by those devotees who are fully pure in heart the highest truth is reality distinguished from illusion for the welfare of all this beautiful bhagavatam compiled by the great sage vyasadeva in his maturity is sufficient in itself for god realization
4120525 stiamo pensando ha detto il ministro in unintervista a italia oggi di sganciare le pensioni dal tasso di inflazione ad oggi applicato e di legarle ad una inflazione nuova ovvero alla crescita dei prezzi di un paniere di beni e servizi ad hoc quelli di cui effettivamente fanno consumo i pensionati di quella fascia ci sono gi simulazioni dellistat
4120526 e un bene che il ministro voglia allestire un paniere ad hoc per i pensionati quando ci sar il confronto valuteremo nel merito ma la proposta in s va nella direzione auspicata da diverso tempo dal sindacato e dalla commissione istituita per vagliare questa ipotesi in modo che i pensionati possano essere risarciti di ci che perdono con linflazione
4120527 sono gli unici che recuperano ben poco di ci che linflazione sottrae
4120528 e un fatto ha concluso bonanni di ingiustizia ed emergenza sociale allinterno della quale matura anche un meccanismo regressivo economico con i consumi ridotti al lumicino

4120532 los temas que est n en discusi n son dos primero los recursos del idh que desde nuestro criterio han sido arrebatados en exceso para la renta dignidad y segundo el tema de las autonom as que debe pasar por una reforma constitucional
4120533 ya no hablan de un pacto fiscal y la nueva constituci n sino de la devoluci n del idh y una reforma constitucional que inviabiliza la aplicaci n de las propias autonom as es por eso que veo una posici n contradictoria esperamos que hasta ma ana jueves cambien de opini n
4120534 ojal no se equivoquen algunas autoridades departamentales ratificadas que los dos tercios de respaldo al presidente morales no est significando otra cosa que no sea la profundizaci n y la continuaci n del proceso de cambio a trav s del nuevo proyecto de constituci n
4120535 i dont want her to think i like her or anything that could make stuff weird between us
4120536 umm you must like her if you miss her this much
4120537 oh wow i need to go find an electric guitar and learn to play this song on it
4120538 my mistake about john edwards was believing all his public boasts about his nearly perfect marriage i allowed myself to judge him through the prism of his union with elizabeth when i would have reached a far different conclusion if i had gazed through the lens of his dalliance with rielle hunter
4120539 happiness is the feeling of increasing power and the overcoming of obstacles
4120540 its hard to judge where prices may go we are in a period where prices are adjusting to new levels buyers and sellers are struggling to find out what that new level is the market will determine it not us or the government once we have reached that level then prices should normalise but that does not mean back to levels seen early last year that were clearly excessive
4120541 funding is not something the central bank can supply it would be a very dangerous move to move to a situation where the government saw its major role as guaranteeing lending
4120542 why should the taxpayer take on the risk of borrowing by individual borrowers some of whom are risky its the lenders who should take on the risk pretending theres a magic solution is not the answer
4120543 the bank cant provide funding to finance investment that has to come from mobilising savings in the economy at home or abroad to fund investment thats what the financial sector is there to do
4120544 i may yet recommend that the government should not intervene in the market on the grounds that such intervention would create more problems than it would solve
4120545 its the riskier borrowers who are finding it more expensive
4120546 thats where the credit crunch is hitting it hasnt had an enormous impact on those people who are much safer borrowers thats what you would expect
4120547 to deliver the best service we need to make sure that our customers and potential customers can speak face to face with a retail adviser at a town near them
4120548 vodafone is now growing slower than both o2 and orange in the uk but they are still growing which is more than can be said for most other markets
4120549 they did have a big push with cheaper tariffs but growth has since dropped back and they are rolling out new shops now to bring it back up and improve competition with the other operators
4120550 its bound to be the case that there is the possibility of a quarter or two of negative growth
4120551 the government will end up having to borrow significantly more than expected
4120552 employment growth has ebbed to a trickle indeed employment has fallen in several regions while the rise in unemployment is gaining worrying momentum
4120553 the figures are a tragedy and hide the misery for tens of thousands of households where people lose their jobs
4120554 the economy is losing momentum but with inflation set to rise to 5 per cent or more in the short term there is little room for interest rate cuts in the immediate future
4120555 las penas no son tan importantes como las acciones para evitar los actos delictivos tenemos que combatir la impunidad y si logramos combatir la impunidad cualquier pena va a ser buena

4120560 what do you do stay at home if you look at the weather it is a different experience
4120561 if you are working to a budget then it is attractive that costs for drinks children and water sports are included
4120562 we are encouraged that management has taken steps to ensure some resilience to changes in demand in the future capacity reduction and fuel hedging combined with the merger synergy benefits provide some reassurance that the group will be able to cope with a downturn
4120563 we are probably one of the best hedged companies out there
4120564 while we are encouraged by these early results we are increasing our flexibility to give us the levers to pull in tougher market conditions including fuel price hedging and capacity management in all our markets
4120565 how do you train over a conference call there are way too many distractions
4120566 wont vote for him because he has no chance of winning
4120567 benefit consumers by providing easy seamless and convenient travel to more global destinations with better connections improved flight schedules and enhanced frequent flyer benefits
4120568 it will improve customer choice by enabling the oneworld global alliance of which american ba and iberia are key members to compete more effectively around the world with other global alliances
4120569 bad for passengers bad for competition and bad for the uk and us aviation industry
4120570 by working together to provide links for connecting passengers the airlines can expand customer choice by supporting routes that would not be economically viable for the individual airlines
4120571 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns
4120572 in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
4120573 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies
4120574 we are applying for eu us anti trust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any us or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
4120575 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world
4120576 it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry
4120577 this deal is good news for consumers who will now have more choice i dont see it leading to higher prices and i think it will increase competition on transatlantic routes
4120578 make no mistake if this monster monopoly is approved it will be third time unlucky for consumers it will still be bad for passengers bad for competition and bad for the uk and us aviation industry
4120579 ba argues that the aviation landscape has changed since their last failed application i disagree nothing has changed open skies has not delivered the greater competition that was promised because heathrow is full
4120580 ba aa and iberia would still be unacceptably dominant with nearly half of all of the slots at heathrow leaving competitors powerless to take them on
4120581 the current economic slowdown is also no justification for agreeing to this alliance
4120582 failing to conduct their business with due skill care and diligence and failing to organise and control their business effectively
4120583 the penalty reflects our tougher stance on enforcement and our policy of imposing higher penalties to achieve credible deterrence
4120584 we are pleased to settle with the fsa so we can now move forward
4120585 the sudden and unexpected announcement of the writedown had the potential to undermine market confidence

4120587 the position of the russia side is not proceed beyond the peacekeeping zone but we have to respond to provocations
4120588 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4120589 we dont want them here what we need is friendship and good relations with the russian people

4120610 unsere gesinnungsgemeinschaft hat mit rupert gmoser eine gro e pers nlichkeit und sozialdemokraten verloren der jahrzehntelang unter anderem als mitglied des bundesrates und abgeordneter zum nationalrat wegweisendes geleistet hat
4120611 rupert gmoser war mit seinem hervorragenden politischen wirken ber die parteigrenzen hinaus gesch tzt und geachtet unsere anteilnahme gilt insbesondere den angeh rigen des verstorbenen
4120612 f r mich schlie t sich ein logischer kreis schon zu beginn meiner berufslaufbahn habe ich f r die kurier romy gearbeitet die mittlerweile zu einem international renommierten fernsehpreis wurde meine begeisterung f r print medien besonders f r den kurier hat mich immer begleitet und ich freue mich nun diese herausforderung gemeinsam mit dem marketingteam annehmen zu k nnen
4120613 ich m chte mich bei marcus mittermeier f r sein engagement und seinen langj hrigen einsatz f r den kurier herzlich bedanken gleichzei tig freue ich mich dass wir mit michaela heumann eine profunde kennerin der medien und werbelandschaft f r den kurier gewinnen konnten um gemeinsam mit ihr und der redaktion die weiterentwicklung des kurier zur multimedialen plattform voranzutreiben
4120614 zu den aussagen von o gkk obmann alois st ger bez glich der ausgabensteigerungen bei medikamenten in den jahren 2007 und 2008 k nnen wir leider keine fundierten aussagen treffen die ober sterreichische gebietskrankenkasse hat ihre gebarung f r das letzte und das laufende jahr noch nicht offengelegt
4120615 es ist f r eine sachliche diskussion nicht f rderlich mit inoffiziellen bzw nicht nachvollziehbaren daten zu argumentieren
4120616 es ist absolut richtig dass die demografische entwicklung in sterreich einer der hauptfaktoren f r die steigenden ausgaben in der gesundheitsversorgung ist ich bin erfreut dass die krankenkassen diese tatsache mittlerweile akzeptiert haben
4120617 es ist eine errungenschaft unserer medizin und unserer gesellschaft dass wir immer lter werden und bis ins hohe alter ges nder bleiben dies sollte als wert und nicht als last anerkannt werden es ist weder sozial noch fair menschen die ihr ganzes leben gearbeitet und beitr ge in dieses system eingezahlt haben das gef hl zu geben sie seien schuld an der finanzmisere der krankenkassen
4120618 die fortschritte in der forschung lassen uns heute krankheiten behandeln die vor wenigen jahren noch nicht therapierbar waren medikamente werden immer effizienter lassen sich besser dosieren und leichter einnehmen mit dem begriff scheininnovation kann ich in diesem zusammenhang nichts anfangen ich wage zu behaupten dass jeder patient eine tablette der injektionsnadel oder gar einer operation vorzieht die gesundheitsversorgung ist ein dynamisches system das nicht nach starren faktoren berechnet werden kann das beweisen innovation und demografie es geht hier um menschen nicht um gleichungen wenn man beginnt entwicklungspotentiale nach konomischen faktoren zu begrenzen bedeutet das nichts anderes als rationierung
4120619 es wird zeit dass sich die krankenversicherungen aktiv f r ihre beitragszahler einsetzen und zu echten gesundheitsorganisationen werden
4120620 und eine gesunde bev lkerung kostet auch weniger als eine kranke
4120621 ik verzeil vaak in meningsverschillen met mijn familie en vrienden
4120622 ik kan mezelf vrij goed oppeppen om dingen op tijd af te krijgen
4120623 ik houd er niet van mijn tijd te verdoen met dagdromen
4120624 its a dream move for me to sign for rangers this is a huge club who showed what they are capable of last season by winning two cups and reaching the final of the uefa cup
4120625 to be honest i thought i was signing for west bromwich albion last week
4120626 i had been to their training ground spoken to tony mowbray and i was happy to get a move which would allow me to stay in the premiership
4120627 in fact i had the pen in my hand ready to sign for west brom until they said the chairman wasnt here and could i come back tomorrow
4120628 it was only then when i was heading away from the ground that the gaffer walter smith phoned me to ask if i would sign for rangers
4120629 i said yes because the club is involved in the champions league or uefa cup every year every player wants to play in big european games and i can achieve this here i can also win cups and league titles with rangers
4120630 today was the first time ive seen the team play and the result wasnt too good but this was a pre season friendly and liverpool are a great team
4120631 i think ill get a better idea of what the boys are like on tuesday against kaunas and when i join up with them in training
4120632 hopefully i will make my debut against falkirk so i thought it would be better to train on my own for two days and get ready to join in with the lads when they return on wednesday
4120633 thomas has a contract and intends to see it out that was always his intention
4120634 there have been no requests from any other clubs and he is happy at celtic of course he would love to be playing but thats the managers decision
4120635 at this stage it seems like he wont get another chance the unfortunate thing is that thomas is a very good player it would be a real shame if he doesnt get a second opportunity
4120636 the celtic fans know that had rangers played the same amount of games as celtic then rangers would have won the league easily
4120637 you could see the celtic fans after winning their final game they may have just won the championship but this year they were not so happy because i am sure they know they only won the spl because rangers players played too many games
4120638 man for man i think that rangers was better last season but we played too many games when the team won the scottish cup no one had the strength to lift the trophy too many players were simply too tired
4120639 last season i am sure rangers were better than celtic this season i will have to wait and see because celtic will have some new players but after five or six games you can quickly see signs of who is emerging as the best
4120640 celtic and rangers also meet four times in the spl and after all of these games you should be able to tell who is better
4120641 carlos has picked up a calf strain although its not the same one as before he
4120642 in fact well need to wait and see if he is fit for the return
4120643 its disappointing because carlos played extremely well for us last season and after losing barry ferguson to injury we certainly didnt want to lose carlos
4120644 we just have to get on with it and we do have other players who can come in and play there
4120645 kevin thomson also missed todays game after picking up a knock to his knee in training but he should be alright for europe
4120646 lee mcculloch has a throat infection and was rested but he should be okay too
4120647 carlos was unbelievable last season and obviously it will be a big loss but whoever comes will be really up for it
4120648 at first we thought it was a joke but when it appeared to be serious we stepped in
4120649 we had a few performances in the last close season that werent great and this was a bit like that we gave the ball away and the manager wasnt happy with that
4120650 he was disappointed because he wants us to put on a good show in front of the travelling fans who were here in numbers it was also a chance for us to show ourselves against an english team
4120651 but these matches are mainly about fitness and gearing yourself for the season ahead
4120652 between this game and southampton on friday night ive played two 45 minutes but they were both high paced games with a lot of running involved
4120653 i think its easier to measure yourself against teams in the uk in past years we have gone to the usa and although they have some good players over there its sometimes hard to gauge how good they are
4120654 theres also a lot of travelling involved when you go out there and sometimes we were even flying on the same day as we were playing
4120655 i think its better for us to have a base which is a few hours away
4120656 he wont come with us because there is uncertainty regarding his future and we have plenty of cover for his position
4120657 rangers registered an initial offer which was refused by the club as far as cousin is concerned we have no interest in him
4120658 i have one big problem here i have come to a club where i have met a lot of nice people
4120659 id like to change this i want to see a lot of hungry people i want people who are hungry for success
4120660 a lot of people say bad things about mr romanov but ill tell you something about him he has made a big mistake and given these people a very nice life
4120661 a lot of these people not all are lazy i have said to mr romanov we must change this we must be more professional
4120662 if you have players who are successful then they deserve to earn very good money players at clubs like bayern munich celtic and rangers deserve money
4120663 but if you dont have success you cant cry out all of the time for money
4120664 a lot of people say bad things about mr romanov but maybe the biggest mistake he has made is putting a lot of money into the club when he hasnt got anything back
4120665 he must change his attitude and we must look at which characters deserve the money
4120666 we can give players a good salary but for the bonuses and success they must work hard
4120667 this is a professional way of working and we must take this direction for the club
4120668 its the same for me if we dont have success i must look for a new job
4120669 im 44 but i have experience i can talk about life i have had a lot of ups and downs a lot of possibilities to feel whats the good life i know whats the bad life whats communism whats capitalism and what it is to stay in a very poor country like uganda
4120670 ive trained national teams spoken to state presidents and guys you may only see on tv
4120671 i had the chance to start at the bottom and teach children and come up no one can tell me anything new
4120672 it is important for me to give this to the players to open their eyes to tell them what can happen
4120673 in romania we did not see anything about western europe on tv and had no way of finding out about it everyone had a dream about what it was like but no one really knew
4120674 it did not really hit me until i made it to west berlin i saw lights everywhere and it was like nothing i had seen before i was used to romania where everything was dark
4120675 from eight oclock to ten and from three until five we had power but then it was cut and we had candles
4120676 in 1979 and 1980 we had a terrible time with food the only way you could buy food from the shops was with coupons
4120677 everyone had a coupon for a half kilo of sugar half a litre of oil and once a month you had one kilo of meat
4120678 during this time we played football for food as a professional we had the chance once a fortnight to go to a big industrial factory that had fridges with all kinds of food
4120679 we were allowed two bags full of cheese meat and all the things normally reserved for those in western europe
4120680 that helps me stay balanced and helps me understand the difference between a good life and a bad one i learned that i now have to enjoy my life
4120681 i dont need a porsche to show i am rich i feel rich in my knowledge in my soul and in my heart and this is a very important lesson for me to tell young people
4120682 in football they can have a nice life with a lot of money for a two hour job and then 90 minutes of a game they must realise this
4120683 i have played in eight in a row and i want to make it nine im not ready to stop playing in the ryder cup
4120684 i was three over after seven holes and i made only one birdie out of the rough at 16 and that was very average
4120685 you could see it was playable so it was a very average score
4120686 its always great playing with monty as he adds a few more spectators which is better than playing with just my family watching
4120687 i hit the ball better today than i did on thursday and friday but i scored worse because the putter was cold
4120688 it is obviously disappointing after being right in contention but tomorrow is another day and six or seven under would definitely put me back into it
4120689 its been a tiring run but i feel strong mentally and believe in my ability winning last week was a huge confidence boost
4120690 the open is very much in my mind i believe it will be a great championship and i want to be part of it
4120691 i have grandparents who live in lytham st annes and my wife is from liverpool so i have a lot of connections with the area
4120692 the key for me in the final round will be to play without fear i need to just try to enjoy the occasion which i havent been doing that for the past year or so but i hit a lot of fairways and greens today and i am happy with my game overall
4120693 i am trying hard not to live in the future but the open and the ryder cup are looming large so it is difficult to stay in the present
4120694 but i have conquered my nerves and i now need to play my own game to give myself a chance of winning here
4120695 no tuvimos nuestro mejor d a y casi tenemos un traspi s

4120703 one proposal under consideration would let states decide whether to permit new energy exploration off their coasts while possibly maintaining the drilling ban off the pacific coast according to a house leadership aide who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of ongoing negotiations pelosi has long opposed lifting the drilling ban but has come under pressure from members of her own party including freshmen in tough reelection campaigns to allow a vote on offshore drilling adding to that democratic presidential candidate barack obama recently said that he would be open to limited offshore drilling if it was part of a broader energy compromise
4120704 denver hosts the democratic convention at the end of this month and a quartet of local millionaires mini george soroses have spent lavishly to boost democrats they have succeeded at shrinking the republican advantage among registered voters the gop now has just 68 507 more voters on the rolls in colorado than democrats down from a 176 572 edge four years ago
4120705 heres the math since the start of the general election season obama has dropped 6 51 million a full 18 percent of his overall ad spending and by the largest chunk of change allotted to any one state to broadcast 10 000 commercials on florida television
4120706 mccains total disbursement 0 zero ads meanwhile chicago has sent more than 200 full time staffers and signed up at least 150 000 online volunteers to man the states 35 field offices the most of any battleground mccains local staff is a quarter of the size and much of it is shared with the state party

4120710 plans to spend 40 million nationally this campaign season and has yet to determine how much will be spent in individual states
4120711 the group was responding to recent remarks by montana gov brian schweitzer a democrat who supports gun rights and told reporters this week that obama aint ever going to take your gun away schweitzer who has the nras support in his re election bid added that there is little difference between the democrat and republican john mccain
4120712 obama mccain and the republican national committee have spent 10 3 million blanketing pennsylvania with general election ads the most spent in any state according to a july 30 analysis by the university of wisconsin advertising project
4120713 we are going to make sure that anybody that tells montana gun owners that barack obama is not a threat to gun owners is exposed as someone who is not shooting straight
4120714 a lot of republicans have already given up on this seat
4120715 it means less time for the media and activists to second guess their choices
4120716 the dnc has unveiled a new web video featuring franklin roosevelts grandson that hits mccain for supporting past efforts to privatize social security and for calling the system
4120717 but lets face it social security has been a winning issue for democrats in past elections and bushs failed effort in 2005 to partially privatize it which mccain supported marked the beginning of the white houses and the gops current political woes
4120718 a pew poll yesterday found obama leading mccain by just three points 46 43 its a downward trend in the poll for the presumptive democratic nominee who led mccain by eight points in june and five in july

4120739 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
4120740 wanna organize yourself get things out of your mind to papers
4120741 be not weary in well doing you will reap if you faint not
4120742 god doesnt respond to what we do we respond to what god does our lives get in step with god and all others by letting him set the pace not by proudly or anxiously trying to run the parade
4120743 if abraham by what he did for god got god to approve him he could certainly have taken credit for it but the story were given is a god story not an abraham story abraham entered into what god was doing for him and that was the turning point he trusted god to set him right instead of trying to be right on his own
4120744 but if you see that the job is too big for you and that its something only god can do and you trust him to do it you could never do it for yourself no matter how hard and how long you worked well that trusting him to do it is what gets you set right with god by god
4120745 we call abraham our faith father because god made something out of abraham when he was a nobody it was because he dared to trust god to do what only god could do raise the dead to life with a word make something out of nothing when everything was hopeless abraham believed anyway deciding to live not on the basis of what he saw he couldnt do but on what god said he would do abraham didnt focus on his own impotence and say its hopeless nor did he survey and give up he didnt tiptoe around gods promise asking cautiously skeptical questions he plunged into the promise and and came up strong ready for god sure that god would make good on what he had said
4120746 we throw open our doors to god and discover at the same moment that he had already thrown open his door to us we find ourselves standing where we always hoped we might stand out in the wide open spaces of gods grace and glory standing tall and shouting our praise we continue to shout our praise even when were hemmed in with troubles because we know how troubles can develop passionate patience in us and how that patience in turn forges the tempered steel of virtue keeping us alert for whatever god will do next in alert expectancy such as this were never left feeling shortchanged quite the contrary we cant round up enough containers to hold everything god generously pours into our lives through the holy spirit christ arrives right on time to make this happen he didnt and doesnt wait for us to get ready
4120747 god is strong and he wants you strong so take everything the master has set out for you well made weapons of the best materials and put them to use so you will be able to stand up to everything the devil throws your way this is no afternoon athletic contest that well walk away from and forget about in a couple of hours this is for keeps a life or death fight to the finish against the devil and all his angels be prepared youre up against far more than you can handle on your own take all the help you can get every weapon god has issued so what when its all over but the shouting youll still be on your feet gods word is an indispensable weapon in the same way prayer is essential in this outgoing warfare pray hard and long pray for your brothers and sisters keep your eyes open keep each others spirits up so that no one falls behind or drops out
4120748 lessons learned from the past research in extreme environments training conditioning and countermeasures for psychological stress are some of the things nasa is in the process of addressing for the upcoming age of exploration
4120749 behavioral health problems can interfere with the success of the mission especially on long duration space flights like missions to the international space station the moon and mars these self guided software tools will provide private and immediate access to treatments even though the patient may be many miles from earth
4120750 for example they emphasized the importance of regular communication regarding work publicity and education all of which provide connection to earth and helped to reduce the perception of isolation
4120751 the closest analogue to mars exploration is the exploration of earth
4120752 both maritime and terrestrial explorers struck off into the unknown often for many years at a time
4120753 preparing for the psychological stress of long duration space missions
4120754 the purpose of the talk and the paper is to make clear just how dire the situation is and how rapidly things are getting worse
4120755 its a lot like the issue of climate change that we had ignored for so long if anything the situation in the oceans could be worse because we are so close to the precipice in many ways
4120756 all of the different kinds of data and methods of analysis point in the same direction of drastic and increasingly rapid degradation of marine ecosystems
4120757 just as we say that leatherback turtles are critically endangered i looked at entire ecosystems as if they were a species
4120758 the reality is that if we want to have coral reefs in the future were going to have to behave that way and recognize the magnitude of the response thats necessary to achieve it
4120759 the challenges of bringing these threats under control are enormously complex and will require fundamental changes in fisheries agricultural practices and the ways we obtain energy for everything we do
4120760 so its not a happy picture and the only way to deal with it is in segments the only way to keep ones sanity and try to achieve real success is to carve out sectors of the problem that can be addressed in effective terms and get on it as quickly as possible

4120762 developers are the driving force behind android applications so without them it would be very hard for android to have a stance in the market
4120763 the android platform has a very strong base and a lot of potential but it also has a lot of competition
4120764 the adc finalists are helping us update the latest version of the sdk before we release it to the world in the coming weeks
4120765 we wanted to limit the challenges developers face with an early release in a particularly critical time during the challenge to not disadvantage them weve separated the scheduled releases to not disadvantage these winners who are competing for money and the public will receive a release of the sdk soon with more documentation and tools
4120766 the idea with open source software is to allow early adopters access to the buggier pieces of code so they can help fix them or let people who want to wait for a solid release the ability to do that
4120767 the key is choice and google has taken away that choice and is developing android like every other piece of closed software
4120768 rather than trying to push yet another platform google ought to be bringing the market together and building applications which is where theyre going to make their money
4120769 the developer discontent is just part of what has turned out to be a flawed strategy
4120770 its the very same reason why apple didnt do third party developers first and thats to assure the process and the program and the quality thats initially being offered
4120771 the community must not forget that google is dealing with partners in the cell phone industry and they certainly have a reputation of a closed source tight lipped mentality
4120772 the community can cry foul if google releases the newest sdk to developers a week before handsets hit the stores but as far as i have heard that is far from the truth
4120773 within the next six months symbian and android will combine into a single open source os
4120774 on the other hand it would be much easier to do now than to tackle it in the future when developers are that much farther down the road
4120775 to tie symbian and android together would require an awful lot of heavy lifting between google and nokia and to do that kind of an agreement would be problematic
4120776 it would have been easier while symbian was small and independent but now that symbian is basically a subsidiary of nokia its going to be pretty difficult
4120777 if you develop for apple youve got a ready market
4120778 if you develop for android its a crapshoot because theres no assurance that the android platform is even going to sell
4120779 while google does simple well this is googles first device as opposed to apple which clearly has been doing devices for a while
4120780 apple is treating developers terribly and really undermining the community
4120781 the fact that applications have to go through the itunes store in order to be distributed really shows how much control apple has over the entire os
4120782 at the end of the day developers want to make money
4120783 so theyre going to develop on a platform and put resources on a platform that will make them money
4120784 undoubtedly some developers have written android off and will never return
4120785 lots arent paying a darn bit of attention to the whole mess because there arent any devices ready yet
4120786 android is going to be something unlike anything currently out there in the cell phone industry
4120787 while it might not be an overnight rock star it certainly will change the mobile world for the better
4120788 bank repossessions or reos continued to be the fastest growing segment of foreclosure activity in july posting a 184 percent year over year increase compared to a 53 percent year over year increase in default notices and an 11 percent year over year increase in auction notices
4120789 nevertheless the unexpected up tick in the core measure does suggest that the past increase in energy and food prices may have seeped through to the core prices the fed is likely to look through this as it is likely to unwind in the coming months
4120790 july cpi was elevated but we do not believe this to be a significant economic problem
4120791 were likely to see a retreat versus these july highs in august amid continued consumer weakness and falling energy prices the federal reserve can largely discount this july result as part of a shorter term phenomenon
4120792 do multiroom systems just do mp3s what about my cds
4120793 in recent years the trend in ya fiction has been toward a proliferation of darker edgier fare aimed at a more mature audience
4120794 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected
4120795 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf

4120819 in talks about making cars cleaner and more fuel efficient with engineers here ive asked whether a small turbine turning at a constant rate wouldnt be an ideal way to power the generator of an electric motor driven car alas the noise high rpm and heat are still expensive problems and turbines small enough to serve such a purpose are prohibitively expensive compared to existing alternatives such as small diesels
4120820 perhaps the biggest drawback is in fuel economy even though the engine itself is relatively efficient it operates at a high rpm even while at idle

4120842 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd
4120843 in june the canadian parliament had passed a motion that war resisters should be able to stay in canada it was a non binding motion but it expressed the will of parliament and the canadian people

4120882 the first part of the equation is simple oil up cpi up at the same time these headline numbers are unlikely to have the same impact they might have had a month ago as the higher oil prices are essentially old news the limited impact is visible in the fact that the treasury markets were lower by only a few ticks in the ten year area of the curve
4120883 the fed can largely discount this july result as part of a shorter term phenomenon
4120884 conditions within rural and regional australia remain generally better than 12 months ago and agricultural markets remain strong
4120885 our assumption that markets will move from pools to cash is likely to prove correct
4120886 farmers have simply too much capital tied up in the cost of fertiliser chemicals diesel and labour to sustain an investment in a grain pool

4120901 anyone in production farming will walk away with knowledge from the variety tests
4120902 corn is beginning to show signs of maturing particularly in drought stressed areas of fields early maturing varieties are beginning to fire up on lower leaves early planted soybeans are looking relatively good in spite of short rainfall conditions many early planted beans are at fungicide application stage or beyond insect pressure in beans remains relatively light wheat beans are suffering from lack of moisture resulting in poor stands and poor growth beans cover wheat straw where moisture has been good and are still struggling to rise above straw in drought stricken areas of fields all crops are beginning to show stronger signs of drought stress in all situations especially in weaker areas of fields crops under irrigation are looking good what we need the most at this point is a good soaking rain
4120903 the farmers in fayette county were blessed with some rain later in the week but before this conditions were hot and humid temperatures were in the upper 90s and lower 100s crops are in fair to good condition farmers were spraying beans and cutting hay

4120908 the peanut profitability award truly gives a whole farm picture of the peanut production on these growers farms
4120909 we look at both the variable and fixed costs and whenever we look at both components of cost it takes a while for these farmers and perhaps their wives to compile all of the information required
4120910 from this we decide the winners whoever has the lowest per unit cost of production
4120911 we dont look at high yields in single small plots but we take into account the overall profitability of the peanut enterprise
4120912 since its inception in 2000 this awards program has honored 27 deserving growers from throughout the southeast virginia carolina and southwest regions of the united states
4120913 each class of winners continues to impress with their innovative technologies and creativity in improving bottom line profits
4120914 the aim of peanut profitability has been to recognize those growers who have shown adaptability in the face of chance and who have continued to produce profitable crops this years class of winners exemplifies the peanut growers who have overcome the perils of farming while continuing to improve their profitability to be in the presence of a peanut profitability award winner is to truly be in the presence of greatness

4120923 it was slightly softer in the second half but i dont regard a 4 7 per cent profit difference one half on the other as a troubling or worrying trend
4120924 thats what you would expect as you see capital being taken out of the system and being allocated to very conservative assets as youre getting lower levels of proprietary trading activity by major banks
4120925 from our perspective up to december we know our volumes and our tonnes pretty well so were quite comfortable with that were not quite sure what will happen in the second half its a bit unknown

4120945 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement sic and i think ridge is a great example of that far moreso than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights pro you know a number of other issues

4120999 if you asked me why i left the democratic party its because of people like russell bates
4121000 in my 20 years this is the tightest election ive ever seen
4121001 we have a series of really unexpected and unusual circumstances nothing in winslow is typical
4121002 i guess theyre trying to blackball russell bates and beat him up so everybody else just stands back
4121003 i cant remember a year when i didnt do one
4121004 were living with mr bates mistakes when he served up here for 23 years allowing the water and sewer department to drive itself into the ground
4121005 he had a chance to do something about it and he did a bad job
4121006 hes going to blame me for water and sewer rates i havent been on the committee in five years as soon as he got on he was spending money
4121007 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4121008 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
4121009 means that georgias ports and airports will be taken under the control of the u s defense department
4121010 it is simply not required for us to fulfill our humanitarian mission
4121011 we have no designs on taking control of any georgian facility
4121012 a special project of the united states and we understand that the united states is worried about its project
4121013 russians are fighting a proxy war with the west through us
4121014 on the one hand this could be a way to set up a buffer zone between the separatist regions and on the other it also seems there is an aspect of disbanding the georgian military aspects
4121015 i say once again its better to compete on the field rather than outside the field
4121016 we have long stood for the normalization of relations between syria and lebanon on the basis of equality and respect for lebanese sovereignty
4121017 one of the steps that has long been required has been the establishment of a proper embassy for syria and lebanon and vice versa

4121061 my career path has been a little bit unique and i would not change it for the world working with high school and junior olympic aged athletes i saw firsthand the recruiting process from that end and helped a lot of my high school student athletes get recruited my background has allowed me to see things from a lot of different angles
4121062 there is a lot more empathy in my recruiting process when i bring a recruit to campus i can relate to them because i have been on that end i have counseled parents through the drama and i think it is helpful i really enjoy helping parents and players through the process even if they dont end up coming here because the recruiting process can be extremely daunting
4121063 when i was at concordia st paul it was barebones they were just starting up an ncaa division ii program and had never won a match i had to be involved with everything i was everything from the marketing department to the athletic trainer my assistants were basically volunteers who would show up after their real jobs to help run practice other than that i had to be self sufficient i had the chance to see every detail that went into building a program and looking back that was an invaluable time period for me in terms of my development as a coach
4121064 it seemed like everywhere i went volleyball kept finding me
4121065 it was neat to be involved with volleyball at the international level because it allowed me to meet a lot of coaches it was my passport to meeting a ton of great belizeans who have remained good friends when i arrived in belize volleyball was my way in it allowed me to learn the language and see things other peace corps volunteers didnt
4121066 you cant win in volleyball with one person you need a pass and a set before the outside hitter can do his or her work its an amazing team sport if you dont have a great team concept you are not going to have a great team dynamic we have been talking a lot about culture from how we get water how we move around the court and how we interact with each other on a daily basis there will always be issues that come up from time to time so we have talked about how as a team we will handle them
4121067 if you make a mistake dont respond wimpy be strong be resilient lose your drama and get back to focusing on the team because momentum changes so fast in volleyball if youre not doing that you are going to lose
4121068 and this group has been great they buy into it and enjoy it we do a lot of journaling and team events outside of volleyball we went on a team retreat where we did a little bit of training but mainly focused on what we want to be about as a team and how we are going to achieve that
4121069 this group really gets along it is an interesting dynamic because we are young our captains are juniors looking at the personalities and their motivation i think we have a neat group everyone on this team has shown they can add leadership to this team
4121070 now it is a matter of finding this teams identity we have a funny group there is a lot of personality on this team with this group there is an intensity and a little bit of a chip on their shoulder mentality
4121071 we are going to be pretty fast we like to run a fast offense to keep our opponents on their toes it is something we did at ohio university we want to stay aggressive with everything we do with a young team that is something we talk about staying aggressive making yourself available to hit a ball and doing all the little things right
4121072 our staff is pretty competitive and intense we like to play with passion and i think we have a good group here at ohio state for that because they love the sport and want to win
4121073 the big ten is a great conference it is the best conference in our country the big difference is the physicality because the big ten is so big with the big ten conference you know you are going to have great coaches and the highest level student athletes from around the country on the court every single day it is a battle penn state is clearly the team to beat right now and has been
4121074 one of the things i am excited about doing at ohio state is building up the fan base we want to make our matches events we want to intrigue and hook columbus as volleyball fans there is a lot of volleyball going on in this state so i think it is possible to make ohio state womens volleyball one of the best in attendance across the nation to do that we are working to connect with columbus youth and the surrounding community to get them excited about ohio state volleyball

4121088 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4121089 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4121090 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4121091 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4121092 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4121093 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4121094 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4121095 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4121096 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4121097 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4121098 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices
4121099 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4121100 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4121101 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4121102 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

4121122 donors who died from cardiocirculatory causes offer an opportunity to reduce waiting time and waiting list mortality among children whose survival depends on a heart transplant
4121123 i dont know how you can ever have a patient that meets the criteria for irreversible loss of function and then reverse that function in someone else
4121124 if death means irreversible loss of cardiac function and that heart beats in someone elses chest its not irreversible is it
4121125 with such consent there is no harm or wrong done in retrieving vital organs before death providing that anesthesia is administered with proper safeguards no patient will die from vital organ donation who would not otherwise die as a result of the withdrawal of life support

4121143 one of the fundamental questions that neuroscientists are facing today is how we link the activity of individual neurons to the complex behaviours that we see in whole organisms and whole animals

4121185 whatever the problem whatever the cause whatever the reason there is no place for violence in our society
4121186 the paths of peace and compromise can be complex and difficult
4121187 wherever differences exist all efforts should be directed towards reconciliation
4121188 there have been instances in our country of people taking the law into their own hands and causing destruction to life and public property
4121189 we must stand united against the threats emanating from terrorism terrorists with their disruptive agenda will never succeed in discouraging us from our resolve to build a strong india or from working with our neighbours to eliminate this menace from our region or from our commitment to forge co operative relations with other countries across the world
4121190 the ideologues of terrorism have little respect for human life they incite violence and mindless destruction
4121191 we should pause and reflect on how our conduct and our actions are promoting unity we must ask ourselves whether our actions are contributing to strengthening of the national fabric and bringing about tolerant thinking
4121192 we should demonstrate our ability to listen to each other to understand each other and if perceptions do not agree give to the others the freedom to hold their views
4121193 as a developing country our demands for energy are growing we cannot let lack of energy become a constraint on our ability to deliver high levels of growth
4121194 with the challenges of increased oil prices and climate change the question of energy security confronts us we need to look at energy mixes that are sustainable in the long run and are cleaner sources of energy gradually making deliberate shift to renewable energy
4121195 technologies increasing efficiency in energy intensive sectors need to be developed any contribution to save energy is a step towards environment protection and in saving the wide diversity of flora and fauna on the planet
4121196 but there are several tasks that await completion and new challenges that need to be addressed a nations work never ends
4121197 implementation done in a transparent and accountable manner will ensure that welfare schemes reach the genuine beneficiaries in a timely manner thus preventing corruption in our system and enhancing efficiency in governance
4121198 seventy per cent of our population lives in villages and is dependent on agriculture therefore the development of india will not be comprehensive or complete unless there is development in the rural areas and increased agriculture productivity
4121199 we must look at a nationwide addiction focused eradication programme eliminating addiction and fighting social evils can be a slow process as it involves changing attitudes
4121200 real development cannot take root if it bypasses women who represent the very pivot around which social change takes shape
4121201 la comunidad de madrid no puede estar presente como acusaci n popular porque al final pueden acabar siendo acusados
4121202 look its a ship and theres the guy and theres a hidden lifeboat so when the ship starts to sink he can run over here and get in the lifeboat to escape see
4121203 well your teacher asked for them and it never hurts to practice a little
4121204 but lets also get the multiplication and division cards so we can practice those too
4121205 hes going to land on a deserted island and then hell build a new ship with the wreckage
4121206 its okay hes going to fly up into the air it will be fun
4121207 there have been many challenges but the greatest one is probably trying to get to know the strengths and weaknesses of the organization both on and off the ice this takes time and being around the people on a daily basis i believe any strong organization starts with good people in the right places and now that i have spent a full year here i feel that i have a better handle on our strengths and weaknesses
4121208 dude thats in play get the heck off the wall
4121209 you look at kids they take their shoes off and run around all the time maybe his feet were hurting that day well educate him a little bit more and tell him about keeping his shoes on till he gets inside we dont like things to happen but they happen what can you do other than try to educate them
4121210 it would take a serious unexpected setback for him to be unavailable for the cowboys game
4121211 id go id probably go like milan or something like that where i grew up or something like that peace out do you know any reasonable person that would turn down 50 million dollars because i grew up in italy it has more significance to me because im more familiar with it ive been there and i still have friends there im thinking about buying a house out there it would be nothing to me to be able to do that
4121212 if someone wants to throw 50 million on the table for me we can talk
4121213 they throw 30 40 50 million a year at me i cant turn that down i think right now its very exciting theyre starting a new buzz you start to do a little research and they got money over there you stay in the states you make the max you make 18 million take out taxes and you have 9 10 you have an opportunity to go somewhere and make 25 30 tax free we might have to pack our bags
4121214 it would definitely be something id consider you can never say never to anything the olympics have shown how this game has grown its not just the united states game anymore its the worlds game
4121215 as a businessman i would have to consider it if my wife was down and the money was right
4121216 from a business standpoint you have to at least listen to every offer
4121217 youre right only cska dynamo and khimki are the teams with huge money in europe along with olympiakos and panathinaikos from greece so if we are talking about lebron or kobe or any other superstar it all comes down to these five teams bc triumph formerly dynamo moscow region surprised everybody by signing krstic to a three million euro per year deal but its their only big buy so far and nobody knows what will happen next i think it is possible that one of these teams will find the money for an nba superstar yet 50 million is still outlandish were not talking about going roughly from 25 million team payroll to 32 million as was the case with childress but going from 25 million to 75 million it would make a little more sense if we were talking about what would be a 50 million a year nba contract which would equal about 17 million euros per year im sure that teams are preparing for talks and nobody is actually ready to just throw out 50 million now anyway its hard to predict anything because this will be an unprecedented move that will change the way we think now about sports contracts cska used to be the team paying crazy salaries compared to other teams in europe but for the last several seasons they have been coached by ettore messina and instead of chasing big names they try to get players that will fit the system this season when everyone is signing superstars the biggest names cska got are zoran planinic and erazem lorbek they are not the team that puts all their eggs in one basket messina is only signed until next summer though so well see what happens also cska has the most success in terms of public relations is well known everywhere in the world and they may be ready to spend to make the next step in these terms if youre nike youd want your player to be in moscow which is one of the world capitals playing for a well known team khimki have been big spenders for several years and this summer they went over the top the reason for that is they are hoping to get a contract with euroleague next summer when it could become a closed league it was announced that euroleague will look at marketability of the teams so khimki signed not just quality players but well known players from nba teams and successful national teams in carlos delfino and jorge garbajosa they went for the biggest names they thought they could target each player received what would be a 9 million a year nba contract the euroleague contract talks will continue next summer and if khimki are desperate to sign the deal they will have to spend crazy money actually if i were the euroleague i would quietly put pressure on the team and say you get lebron and well sign you to a euroleague contract on the other hand this is a smaller city in moscow region dynamo has a reputation of an underarchieving team here in russia they spend cska like money on their roster yet the results are very different this year they finally got a great coach in david blatt and also signed bostjan nachbar to what would be again a 9 million nba contract they are rumored to be targeting ben gordon now that its known that players of this caliber are available for the right money once again its impossible to tell how far the team can go in terms of spending because whats happening now is unprecedented for years dynamo has been the richest team that is not in the euroleague and they are desperate to get in the league still it is not surprising that it was a greek team which was the first to hand out a huge contract their owners have the most freedom to act because they are just that owners one person for each team russian teams have to find sponsors for each deal either from businesses or local governments which takes time and pursuasion sic if a greek owner feels like spending it will take him a second to give a go ahead to team management eccentric billionaire fan owners is not what russia is about
4121218 even more enticing to james has to be the revelation that earl boykins recently signed contract with italys virtus bologna includes income from bolognas sponsorship and marketing arms due to the nbas collective bargaining agreement this sort of arrangement is off limits in the nba but its exactly what lebron james inc is looking for james is right he wont become a billionaire by playing basketball so he and his management team have begun to look for more than endorsement dollars theyre now interested in equity stakes in the companies lebron lends his name to what if the owners of cska moscow or olympiacos the two teams reported to have contacted james offered him equity stakes in the teams and or outside business ventures they accumulated their billions in in addition to his playing salary an equity stake in a billion dollar business would pay dividends long after james called it quits on the hardwood and it would inch james closer to his stated goal of becoming the richest man in the world if the nbas collective bargaining agreement allowed it you can bet that james would negotiate an ownership percentage in the cavs or the soon to be brooklyn nets or the new york knicks any discussions between james and olympiacos or cska moscow will begin with what the euroleague can offer that the nba cannot
4121219 i wonder if the nba will be forced to adopt an mls style
4121220 european teams have rules that limit the number of non european teams that can be on their roster
4121221 but seriously cleveland cant pay 50 million for lebron nor should any american team pay that
4121222 cleveland shouldnt pay nor should any american team yadda yadda
4121223 no one will talk on the record about any potential move of tribe prospects from buffalo to columbus

4121225 but i would have my head in the sand to think there arent some back channel things going on
4121226 were going to have a lot of the basics on the menu some really nice salads at lunchtime thai chicken salad and shrimp salads
4121227 and some of the pizzas we made popular at corleones flatbread pizzas are a big seller for us and some nice corned beef and french dip sandwiches
4121228 for dinnertime im hoping well get into a harry carays kind of place
4121229 expect to find 20 big screen tvs a draft beer system featuring at least 15 to 20 specialty drafts and local brews as well as a radio transmission area where golic can do live broadcasts
4121230 we were the favorite based on our individual performance but its really hard to deal with that type of expectations of everybody else i think that we needed to work on our focus a little bit more
4121231 im upset but its important not to get too upset right now at this moment because we still have a chance for a bronze medal and we need to concentrate on that
4121232 i was having difficulties we just couldnt hold on were going to go regroup and hopefully well be able to pull ourselves together
4121233 so i think they could have had better momentum but you have to be ready for everyone and we werent ready

4121255 the consistent message of the gospels calls us to recognize that all life is sacred because all human beings are created in the image of god and jesus commanded us to love our neighbors as ourselves the billions affected by poverty diseases illiteracy and oppressive or corrupt governments are our neighbors and they deserve our compassion support and comfort they are living without hope happiness or good health this is why we need the peace plan and the peace coalition together as individuals churches corporations and countries we must do all we can to cooperate in eradicating these giant problems the mobilization of local churches to aid educate and empower others through the peace plan has already made an impact on these problems and will only increase i am so grateful for the peace plan and i thank rick and kay warren for their leadership worldwide
4121256 through the peace plan thousands of partners are acting on the belief that the challenges we face today are not simply technical problems in search of a ten point plan they are moral problems rooted in both individual callousness and societal indifference due to the imperfections of man the peace plan marshals the hard work and good will of churches placing trust in the limitless power of a living and awesome god it proclaims with loving witness that the weary and heavy laden across the globe can find rest and strength in the arms of their brothers and sisters ordinary people empowered by god to change the world michelle and i will be praying fervently for the success of the peace coalition moreover as partners and as friends we will be working with rick and kay warren and all americans willing to see that the aims of this great plan are realized gods call to be our brothers keeper and our sisters keeper requires of us nothing less

4121313 the main factor associated with an unconsummated marriage was the intense social pressure to accomplish hasty coitus with an unfamiliar woman some men having had no social contact with their new bride and in the presence of relatives waiting nearby for evidence of the brides virginity and confirmation of coitus
4121314 taking on a new role as a married woman and a new identity as a sexual human being
4121315 sometimes even after the education has been provided the anxiety reduced and the sexual dysfunction has been treated we find that the couple still does not have intercourse

4121413 wir sind dar ber informiert und machen uns unsere gedanken
4121414 the most anticipated amp talked about post of the year
4121415 in my opinion absolutely any offense can work if its personnel driven texas didnt do too bad with the spread offense last year and penn state wasnt too sahabby in the spread either
4121416 trying to learn an offense on the go while playing the sec schedule is going to be tough
4121417 in all things my mom used to say in tough situations this too shall pass
4121418 thank god its passed now those guys are seasoned players theyve been through an sec year
4121419 everybody talks about the road games that we have to play
4121420 i can tell you they count one if youre going to be a champion youre going to have to win road games were going to worry about ourselves and look forward to that road schedule
4121421 our program is as solid as its been since ive been at auburn
4121422 our team is built on playing defense and running the football kenny has been a blessing for us to pick up running where ronnie brown and carnell williams left off
4121423 were trying to improve were not there yet hopefully i can someday come to sec media days and tell you we have a team that is ready to challenge for the sec which i probably did all 12 years at florida were not there yet but hopefully after one or two more recruiting classes these guys growing up becoming ball players well be in that position
4121424 that was the lowest ive ever had a team in the conference but thats just where we are
4121425 if we can get up in the top half this year that would be very good for us
4121426 but i look in their eyes i look at their work ethic i look at their attitude these guys are ready theyre hungry our fans our hungry
4121427 i think last year was an aberration but we still have a lot of work to do to get back to where we want to be
4121428 i dont think you just flip a switch and say oh were going to be back there the goal is always to be in the championship mix we have a group of talented young players that if we play up to our expectations and abilities then i think we have a chance to make a run again
4121429 what david brings is a really sound fundamental system to coach the quarterbacks and run the offense thats been proven over a period of time
4121430 we just cant play a guy based on potential right now
4121431 i dont want to look at our seniors and say hey were going to play joe cox or stafford because were going to get them ready for the future no were going to try to win this year
4121432 i think hes a leader for this football team and not just the offense but the entire team hes got good arm strength a good touch good accuracy and hes mobile hes not vince young by any means but he can make plays when he needs to
4121433 hes improving every day and seeing that makes me feel good about him coming back
4121434 i want to first of all express my condolences to the families of these murdered humanitarian workers
4121435 this is obviously an outrage a terribly brutal act which i think should remind everybody of the brutality of the taliban and the danger that everybody there faces not just military people but all those who are there trying to help rebuild this country
4121436 this was a despicable senseless and cowardly attack on people who were working to improve the lives of some of the most disadvantaged people in afghanistan women and girls and children with disabilities who live in conflict zones
4121437 i join the international community in condemning this brutal act
4121438 they were not working for the interests of afghanistan and they belonged to those countries whose forces took afghanistans freedom
4121439 i was not interested in making a record about the d word i got all that stuff out of my system on the last record 2005s pensive songs for silverman which was deliberately stoic this new album is really about me being free which is why it feels cathartic and expressive its about me coming back to being myself
4121440 i came out of the courthouse kissed the ground and walked straight into the studio i felt like a bottle of champagne that had been shaken for 18 months and popped open in the studio thats why this record has so much energy
4121441 ha ha you get to punch that bitch over and over
4121442 yes but why was daddy on top of you and then you were on top of daddy
4121443 well we were hugging just hugging and cuddling um how long were you standing there anyway
4121444 each year as many as 50 infants are placed on the waiting list for cardiac transplantation but die while waiting owing to the lack of a suitable donor heart
4121445 adding an additional two three or five minutes or even 75 seconds does add some additional injury it could be 10 per cent
4121446 the six month survival rate was 100 per cent for the 3 transplant recipients and 84 per cent for 17 control infants who received transplants procured through standard organ donation
4121447 as a result of their investigational protocol three babies are now alive had the procedures not been performed it is virtually certain that all six babies would be dead
4121448 removing organs from a patient whose heart not only can be restarted but also has been or will be restarted in another body is ending a life by organ removal
4121449 all i am trying to say is is that i was raised with a wonderful family surrounding me of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body

4121464 todays actions by the texas house of representatives combined with overwhelming bi partisan support for senate bill 247 establish the state of texas as a leader in the fight against the first genocide of the 21st century texans should be proud to help lead the world in making never again a reality

4121478 we call her fearless shes very athletic and willing to try new things
4121479 weve found that in all the tests they do tend to favour particular limbs which tends to give them a legs and arms sort of layout
4121480 their front two tentacles will be used for a lot of exploratory work and then the ones immediately behind them will then be used also if further investigation is needed
4121481 then the further back you go the more the limbs are used for propulsion and movement
4121482 from what weve seen all the limbs basically have the same capabilities but they seem to favour this system and it works well for them
4121483 with live prey it does help them when sneaking up with the front limbs ready to pounce and using the back ones for propulsion
4121484 they have that facility unlike humans where if we tried to grab our food with our feet we might fail miserably

4121544 there are no formal reasons to stop these accession talks

4121603 wow did you really just ask me that she is a 14 year old girl and you are a pedophile i was caught out of nowhere so i didnt really come up with the proper response at the time theres many other things that i felt like saying but why give it to a random guy with a camera so that he can make money
4121604 of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body

4121651 we the undersigned petition the prime minister to respect the result of the irish referendum and abandon the attempt to ratify the lisbon treaty
4121652 the irish referendum on the lisbon treaty has resulted in a decisive no vote however politicians across europe are calling for the ratification of the treaty to go ahead the british government are planning to put the lisbon treaty to its third and final reading in the lords next wednesday 18 june this would complete its ratification in the uk we believe that the prime minister should respect the result of the irish referendum and abandon the attempt to ratify the lisbon treaty
4121653 the rules of the treaty and the eu are clear all 27 member states must ratify the treaty for it to come into force there is no question of ignoring the irish vote or bulldozing irish opinion ireland clearly cannot be bound by changes which it has not ratified equally there is no appetite for a return to years of institutional negotiation the eu as a whole needs to find a way forward for all countries that allows the eu to focus on the big policy issues that confront us

4121667 hes probably had one of the best tournaments anyone has ever had in the domestic one day game but unless youre banging out 2 000 runs in the championship one day cricket always gets overlooked a little bit
4121668 hes very hungry about scoring runs hes at a stage where hes not going to play for his country hes just got county cricket and hes very very driven
4121669 hes getting towards the latter years of his career but i think hes got a few of them left and hes got an immense appetite for runs and for improving
4121670 every year hes come back to us hes come back a better player
4121671 there are too many players in county cricket when they cant play for england any more theyre just happy to cruise through wheras van jaarsveld every year makes a little change here and there and becomes a better player and its a credit to him

4121690 uv light radiation produces tholins that look more like titans haze
4121691 some if not most of the products we make also dont react with water
4121692 tholins formed at low pressure seem to look more like titans haze than those formed at higher pressures you can make tholins at low pressures using uv light you cannot make tholins at low pressure using plasma discharge and to make the amount of tholins we needed for the experiment we needed to use the discharge technique uv photolysis only produces small amounts
4121693 were not directly marketing and associating lego batman with the release of the dark knight theyre in different release windows and despite some overlap have different target audiences as well
4121694 however the fact that the dark knight has performed so brilliantly at the cinema obviously bodes well the amount of interest around both the film and heath ledgers amazing performance has really put batman back in the minds of the public as were saying at warner 2008 is fast becoming the year of the bat

4121709 kerry himself is already implementing the lessons of 2004 the massachusetts senator launched a website wednesday truth fights back challenging the assertions in corsis book
4121710 believe obamas senior aides must figure out how to effectively and directly respond to the book
4121711 initially wanted to respond directly to the charges but his top circle of advisers after heated debate counseled against it former senior advisers have said in the subsequent weeks that august as the national media picked up the story and began constantly looping the ads kerrys campaign reversed itself and went on the offensive today within kerrys circle and outside it the view is that the response was too late
4121712 recent reports on obamas florida spending which easily overwhelms john mccains suggest that the sunshine state remains at least at this point the democratic nominees top pickoff target for 2008 much as it was for john kerry in 2004 and al gore in 2000
4121713 heres the math since the start of the general election season obama has dropped 6 51 million a full 18 percent of his overall ad spending and by the largest chunk of change allotted to any one state to broadcast 10 000 commercials on florida television mccains total disbursement 0 zero ads meanwhile chicago has sent more than 200 full time staffers and signed up at least 150 000 online volunteers to man the states 35 field offices the most of any battleground mccains local staff is a quarter of the size and much of it is shared with the state party
4121714 if obama can win florida on nov 4 which george w bush carried by five points in almost guaranteed to win the white house
4121715 the simple fact is that at least two of the candidates mccain is thinking very seriously about picking as his second in command tom ridge and sen joe lieberman i conn who are publicly in favor of abortion rights a third potential candidate former massachusetts gov mitt romney was supportive of abortion rights until a few years ago although he has now adopted a solidly pro life position
4121716 but there isnt a whole lot of love lost between the two groups would mccain picking a pro choice vice president inflame these critical voters who have largely held their collective tongues to this point or will ardently pro life voters make a pragmatic decision and stay behind mccain under the belief that the arizona senator would be a far better president for the issues important to them than would obama

4121718 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
4121719 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view

4121739 i dont know who is paying the attorney fees because we havent talked money
4121740 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
4121741 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4121742 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4121743 overall the new iphone is performing just great on our 3g network
4121744 we urge our customers to synch iphone 3g to itunes frequently to ensure they have the latest software updates
4121745 im so sick of hearing people say turn off 3g uh why pay an extra 10 for at amp ts iphone plan and get a new phone that is advertised to just work then i returned my iphone 3g because the iphone 3g stinks in my opinion i went back to my original iphone
4121746 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4121747 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4121748 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4121749 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4121750 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4121751 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4121752 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4121753 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4121754 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4121755 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4121756 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4121757 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4121758 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4121759 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4121760 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4121761 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4121762 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4121763 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4121764 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4121765 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4121766 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4121767 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4121768 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4121769 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4121770 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4121771 our absent friends from michigan and florida to come join us
4121772 i dont like his iraq war policy i supported the war at the beginning but im increasingly disillusioned with it mccain just seems to want to keep it going
4121773 two years in the senate and one of them he spent running for president and im not happy with reverend jeremiah wright
4121774 she is not the best candidate we could have just the best available
4121775 it may be idealistic but i really like his emphasis on change
4121776 pel mar corren conills i per la muntanya anguiles aibo per la muntanya anguiiilees
4121777 changed lives changed minds changed laws changed social orders and changed hearts in a changed world
4121778 means we embrace our individual rich histories all of them we retain who we are as persons of different cultures while acknowledging that those of other cultures are not superior or inferior to us they are just different from us
4121779 no no the whole sermon thats yes or no no you havent heard the whole sermon that nullifies that question
4121780 we were very happy with her at gowran and it was a bit of a relief as the ground was very heavy and it was a bit of a decision to make to actually run her
4121781 she put in a good show and moved well so we will probably run her in the blandford stakes at the curragh next september 13
4121782 many of us are motivated by a deep disgust with and distrust of the dnc leadership
4121783 there will be no unity in the democratic party until the voices of the 18 million voters who support hillary clinton are heard and heeded until the voices of pumas are once again listened to by the leadership of the democratic party we will be guided by that defiance we will not be bullied brainwashed or bossed into falling in line
4121784 i woke up that morning and said holy smoke theyre not even gonna let her run and compete the obama campaign is gonna sit back and take the benefits of that crap from msnbcs mike barnicle and chris matthews and tucker carlson and maureen dowd and howard dean thats what did it for me
4121785 our goal is to get the dnc to follow the process and let the delegates vote for her nomination
4121786 theres a big difference between a hope and a goal
4121787 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4121788 wir wollen verhindern dass ein nicht endendes katz und maus spiel zwischen polizei und jugendlichen entsteht wie wir es aus spanien und frankreich kennen
4121789 wir k nnen nur eingreifen wenn ffentliche ordnung und sicherheit gef hrdet sind
4121790 das n chste mal m ssen wir uns in einem park treffen den sie nicht zusperren k nnen
4121791 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4121792 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4121793 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4121794 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4121795 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4121796 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4121797 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4121798 my name is mickael westen ans i was a spy until we had a burn notice on you youre blaclisted
4121799 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4121800 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4121801 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4121802 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4121803 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4121804 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4121805 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4121806 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4121807 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4121808 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4121809 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4121810 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4121811 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4121812 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4121813 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4121814 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4121815 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4121816 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4121817 who are open to doing something on the production side
4121818 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4121819 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4121820 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4121821 i wish i could vote for both of you well that might be possible someday
4121822 i dont know how somebody whos in second place in delegates and popular votes is offering the vice presidency to somebody whos in first place
4121823 got even a right wing nut like me all fired up
4121824 the one chance our party might have is with someone like mccain who can compete for the middle
4121825 im impressed with his candidate skills and i expect once he has finished running against moveon catechism why would america vote for a candidate echoing what senator kennedy has been saying for 25 years
4121826 he is the only candidate with both military experience and national security credentials
4121827 when it goes beyond the uplifting rhetoric and the public begins to drill down into obamas positions the numbers will move
4121828 up 10 or 11 points today and theres no way she will lose pennsylvania
4121829 if she wins ohio and texas her margin will be bigger if she loses she wont be running
4121830 i dont know if she has time to show the personal side i see the compassion for people shes running against a phenomenon
4121831 outpolled mccain 2 to 1 in one of the most heavily military states
4121832 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
4121833 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
4121834 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians
4121835 i figure theres no way i can unseat him that was not my goal
4121836 the demographics of seattle are such that i do not believe that if i could bring abraham lincoln back to life that he could be elected in the city of seattle
4121837 people here they know mcdermott pretty well and he has all the advantages of name recognition
4121838 hes about as safe a congressional incumbent as you could find
4121839 came to see that the republican party was far superior on foreign policy
4121840 im not sailing into very tough wind in that kind of district
4121841 hes ready to take his fight down into the mud
4121842 asks a valid question of whether the relatively inexperienced obama is ready to lead
4121843 we all have a right to our own opinion including todd
4121844 oh ya i almost forgot to explain to carolyn and the others out there about
4121845 carolyn al is correct but it goes one step further mr weaver never intended to try and use the vi money for flood releif he wants to put a halt to anything to do with vision iowa and use the 5 8 million dollars that would have been the citys responsability and use it for flood releif
4121846 jb i forgot to mention that the speed limit on all trucks should be reduced to 45m
4121847 carolyn where to you get the idea that max wanted to use vi funds to aid flood victims
4121848 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
4121849 we must lower gas prices and a chicken in every pot for every voting american
4121850 well what right do you have to speak about them then
4121851 i am absolutely certain that generations from now we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment when we began to provide care for the sick and good jobs to the jobless this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal this was the moment
4121852 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4121853 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4121854 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4121855 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4121856 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4121857 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4121858 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4121859 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4121860 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4121861 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4121862 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4121863 this is a truly great leader a truly great man a truly inspiring man
4121864 its going to be a whos who of the convention
4121865 the denver school of the arts in colorado pulls off the rare achievement of bringing 40 young people aged 14 17 on stage showing off some impressive performing skills and offering the audience a truly substantial and moving glimpse into the mind of the generation now trembling on the cusp of adulthood
4121866 you have to declare a party affiliation to vote in the primaries and that concerns me
4121867 are you afraid im going to register as a communist
4121868 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4121869 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4121870 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4121871 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4121872 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4121873 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4121874 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4121875 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4121876 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4121877 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4121878 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4121879 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4121880 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4121881 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4121882 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie
4121883 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
4121884 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
4121885 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4121886 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4121887 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4121888 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
4121889 in each series olaf presents an exploration of the moment
4121890 olafs photography is somewhat reminiscent of the paintings of norman rockwell but explore the darker moments of individuals lives and emotions
4121891 the exhibition is an examination of the creative strategies employed by some of the most innovative artists working in the quilting sector today but is not intended to be an exhaustive survey of contemporary quilting
4121892 i have created more than 300 quilts my quilts are all about how i see color and color relationships how i see shapes and how i see line and linear movement my quilts are also about complexity sadness and hope
4121893 the position of the russia side is not proceed beyond the peacekeeping zone but we have to respond to provocations
4121894 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4121895 we dont want them here what we need is friendship and good relations with the russian people
4121896 we let her stay here and now shes blaming everything on us
4121897 i see absolutely no reason for that and its silly
4121898 they can buy a locomotive anyplace in the world they can buy it anyplace in the world but they buy it here because its the most fuel efficient and its the most environmentally sound and it requires the least maintenance
4121899 i want you and every american to tell the congress that when we start anew in january of 2009 lets sit down together republican and democrat libertarian vegetarian whoever it is lets sit down together and start working on these problems together and put our country first
4121900 now if youd just raise your hand we have some people with a microphone or if youd like to go back to work whichever
4121901 where did the internet come from besides al gore and by the way i have great respect for vice president gore
4121902 eighty four percent of the american people think that the countrys on the wrong track congress has a 9 percent approval rating now you get down to 9 percent youre down to paid staffers and blood relatives you cant get much lower than that
4121903 um call tom ridge to washington from whatever vacation he is taking and get him to work
4121904 who will be the next president of the united states
4121905 the most productive and most competitive worker in the world resides in the united states of america
4121906 drilling offshore isnt the answer either but its a bridge its an important bridge to exploit our own oil and natural gas reserves while were making this transition that we must make to energy independence
4121907 i liked what he had to say today i want to hear more of what hes going to do to solve our issues
4121908 its a very important thing to do in life vote for someone thats going to run your future
4121909 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
4121910 our 14 offices are part of a highly structured volunteer heavy plan to win in new hampshire
4121911 we are creating neighborhood teams with volunteers who are trained equipped and empowered to build a campaign organization in their own neighborhood
4121912 i think weve built on that grass roots effort from 2004
4121913 the populations seem to be gradually going downhill and its not clear if or when thats going to stop
4121914 within a decade we may not have any in washington unless they do something
4121915 i have not lost hope for spotted owls but i think were at a pretty serious crossroads
4121916 theres no way at this point to predict how this will ultimately play out
4121917 someone described it as a bathtub its just filling up with barred owls
4121918 if you get a room of field biologists people who have been out in areas where barred owls are present in any number you dont get any disagreement about it
4121919 as a society we may choose not to control barred owls but we ought to do it with the knowledge of what would it take and is it feasible
4121920 you could shoot barred owls forever and as soon as you quit theyre going to be right back
4121921 theyre pulling the habitat rug out from underneath a declining species
4121922 there really isnt any evidence to suggest that creating more habitat reserves will alter adult owl survivorship
4121923 all youre doing is protecting more habitat for the barred owl
4121924 propensity to vote is in part based on enthusiasm but its more typically assessed using voting history and intention among other factors obviously for election outcomes all that matters is whether people vote not whether they do so enthusiastically a challenge for obama is to convert highly energized supporters there is currently an enthusiasm gap favoring obama into registered voters and then into actual voters
4121925 when youre talking about campaign funds they cant be used for personal use you cant use campaign funds to buy yachts or go out to barbados
4121926 friends can give gifts to people up to a certain limit beyond that its income to the recipient
4121927 whether its an in kind contribution if they were paying her for something that was not campaign work probably not
4121928 in countless public fora the bush administration has pledged its commitment to georgias territorial integrity that commitment has always been followed by the hope that all potential conflicts would be resolved peacefully administration officials insist that in private conversations at the highest levels they have told the georgians that their commitment did not include military intervention on georgias behalf and say they have repeatedly urged the georgians not to provoke the russian bear but this stance gives rise to a question at natos most recent summit the administration pushed very hard to grant georgia a place on the initial rung of the ladder toward nato membership european governments blocked that attempt but u s remains committed to getting georgia into the atlantic alliance the definition of nato membership of course is a mutual defense commitment an attack on one equals an attack on all are we ready to go into battle against russia to defend georgia in nato
4121929 this question has gotten pretty heavy coverage over the past week
4121930 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4121931 both these titles represent a different part of the casual gaming spectrum with colour cross a brain teasing game requiring thought and puzzle solving skills on the other hand cradle of rome is a highly addictive fast paced casual game ideal for those pick up and play moments these titles are also the first non japanese developed projects rising star games will publish and represent an opportunity to expand our catalogue to encompass all types of gamers
4121932 the message is that russia has perhaps not accepted that it is time to move on from the cold war and it is time to move to a new era in which relations between states are on the basis of equality and sovereignty and economic integration
4121933 we will use u s aircraft as well as naval forces
4121934 rally the free world in the defense of a free georgia
4121935 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4121936 i have to say that the reports are not encouraging about russias respect for this cease fire
4121937 therefore since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us let us fix our eyes on jesus the author and perfecter of our faith who for the joy set before him endured the cross scorning its shame and sat down at the right hand of the throne of god
4121938 een scherp profiel met scherpe kanten en een uitzonderlijk opvallende anatomie dat zou toch zeker moeten opvallen maar ik zie ze niet rondlopen wat een onzin aad
4121939 werent you just in there yesterday dont they ever give you a day off haha
4121940 an atheist stockbroker in surbiton looks exactly like a swedenborgian stockbroker in wimbledon you may walk round and round them and subject them to the most personal and offensive study without seeing anything swedenborgian in the hat or anything particularly godless in the umbrella it is exactly in their souls that they are divided
4121941 so many guys had been standing on the ceiling pipe looking into the room that the insulation was worn off the top of the pipe
4121942 boys will be boys this has been going on at disney for 20 years a large workforce will attract oddballs
4121943 diminished expectation of privacy in their particular job and knowingly assumed the risks
4121944 we had a guy who traveled the disney hotels and go to the pool areas he was taking close up photos of kids climbing in and out of pools three or four year olds and sometimes suits werent covering backsides properly if you know what i mean you just knew he was going to make a move on a kid we wanted to get him but disney didnt want any part of it
4121945 the cost of background checks on its employees would be prohibitive
4121946 whats the point other than you want to make headlines
4121947 the film follows a number of barely pubescent looking boys and girls around new york city as they smoke pot bait gays beat a black man and engage in graphic sex
4121948 under pressure miramax formed an independent company to market and distribute the pornographic movie
4121949 so much cocaine my nose exploded into a bloody mess and i had to have plastic surgery that was a pretty good one
4121950 the new disney will do just about anything to make a buck
4121951 as we embark on our new global alliance we anticipate ten great years of unbeatable family fun as customers enjoy the magic of disney only at mcdonalds
4121952 too cute disney label which on top of using kids for workers owed a lot of money in back wages
4121953 people who are making disney shirts are living in utter misery
4121954 in some cases kids have hands eaten away by solvents
4121955 knowing everything that happens in the park every location with every employee and every guest
4121956 if you had 8 people managing a ride and then you have 2 and something comes up then you have one then things happen
4121957 you need to have an independent investigation that would be uninfluenced by disney
4121958 maybe the worker was under the influence maybe the maintenance records indicate this cleat was due for maintenance two weeks earlier you treat it as a crime scene until you know otherwise
4121959 relentless they hid witnesses they forbid employees who were witnesses to talk to us finally one did the person who played minnie mouse
4121960 ziemi na kt rej jackson nakr ci w adc pier cieni
4121961 tbilisi georgia it was a claim that could have provoked a dangerous kremlin response the united states is readying to take over airports and ports in the former soviet republic of georgia the claim by u s backed georgia president mikhail saakashvili on wednesday was swiftly shot down by officials in washington who denied any such designs on georgian soil yet it was the latest in a string of overstated pronouncements by the american educated georgian leader that are further fueling tensions with moscow
4121962 georgian officials said the russians had looted and bombed gori before they left moscow denied the accusation but it appeared to be on a technicality a bbc reporter in gori said russian tanks were in the streets while their south ossetian allies seized cars looted homes and set houses on fire
4121963 heres a deal if by aug 17th georgia is not part of nato defacto or otherwise you will post a humble apology to me in your profile
4121964 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
4121965 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
4121966 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
4121967 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
4121968 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
4121969 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
4121970 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
4121971 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
4121972 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
4121973 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
4121974 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
4121975 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
4121976 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
4121977 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
4121978 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
4121979 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
4121980 republicans are moving to examine surges in voter registrations in some states a republican lawyers group held a national training session on election law over the weekend that included campaign attorneys for sen john mccain and other republican leaders one session discussed how party operatives can identify and respond to instances of voter fraud
4121981 republicans said they are particularly worried about prospects for fraud in virginia and pennsylvania and are beginning to comb thousands of new registrations in those states for ineligible applicants in some cases the huge numbers threaten to swamp their efforts and those of state and local governments to verify and process applications election officials in virginia and other states say there is no evidence of widespread fraud so far numerous studies have found fraud and other voting irregularities in past elections to be infrequent and generally not prevalent enough to influence the outcomes of most contests some republican lawyers say that despite the huge numbers of new registrations in some areas this years problems could be fewer compared to prior years because of improved procedures and tougher rules
4121982 regardless of how the voters got on the rolls johnson said the sheer number of democrats is a concern this year as is the fact that more hispanics are now registered democrats about 455 000 hispanics are now in the democratic party which only this year surpassed republicans who count 425 000 in their ranks compared to the last presidential election the numbers are even more dramatic for african americans more than 207 000 have joined the democratic party since 2004 accounting for 44 percent of the new voter growth
4121983 the boom that turned swamps and pastures into a suburban mecca has stopped dead now the talk is about plummeting home values rising food costs and gas prices that make the once painless half hour commute to tampa a financial strain its enough to give some here the sense that maybe this time around the republicans do not deserve their votes
4121984 even as younger voters are showing signs of breaking with years of lackluster turnout to support him obama is facing singular resistance from voters over 65 that age group turns out at the highest rate on election day and is disproportionately represented in the swing states of florida and pennsylvania bill clinton and al gore both relied on it in winning the democrats only popular vote majorities of the past two decades
4121985 with polls showing obama dominating among those under 40 and running even among middle aged voters republican john mccains lead among those 65 and older is the main reason he remains close overall his margin is largest among older white voters without a college education accounting for much of obamas problem with the white working class
4121986 by this time in 2004 president bushs re election campaign had spent 13 5 million on television in florida the president went on to win the state in november sen obamas ads have touched every media market in florida which is the most expensive for advertising among the closely fought states
4121987 how the gop is moving to examine these surges in the voting rolls
4121988 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4121989 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4121990 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4121991 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
4121992 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
4121993 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
4121994 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4121995 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4121996 higher superstition the academic left and its quarrels with science
4121997 because in math and organic chemistry you find truths someone cannot say 2 2 5 or that a carbon molecule no longer has a molecular weight of 12
4121998 i sort of remember looking at it and thinking someones got to do something about this
4121999 to my complete surprise and shock people were obeying my traffic signals
4122000 there were all kinds of impromptu block parties that happened all over the city restaurants did their best to accommodate their customers when something like a blackout occurs people generally are going to pitch together and help out everyone else it sounds kinda hokey but its the truth
4122001 the price of gasoline in the last year has had a bigger impact on peoples thoughts about conservation than the blackout
4122002 we never found in much of the research we had done that there was a direct connection between the big blackout and issues around using too much or too little energy
4122003 i think people are creatures of habit to some degree and i dont think theres any lingering effects in reduced consumption from the blackout
4122004 the individual customers out there i believe want to help
4122005 to me it was the blackout day that got me thinking more and more about the environment and everything ive been doing it was just amazing how much we could get done without electricity and we actually enjoyed having no power
4122006 there were a few things that wouldve been nice like having the hot water tank working but for everything else we became creative we started having fondue
4122007 it can be contagious if you know one person doing something then another is more likely to start doing it as well and so it creates a chain reaction
4122008 environmental problems have been ongoing for a very long time but now im seeing that people are taking it seriously and i think its only going to increase probably exponentially over the next little while
4122009 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4122010 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
4122011 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how bill richardson is the right man for running mate
4122012 remember that it was the democrats who created the kkk as their political action wing they were the same ones who kept segregation going with george wallace leading the fight democrats fought against the emancipation proclamation womens right to vote civil rights and the list goes on martin luther king was a registered republican they use the same plays that they did against lincoln same rhetoric it is amazing these are all facts that the dems dont want you to know they are purpetually reworking history it is proven that most of what they blame on republicans is actually what they are doing or have done
4122013 a source close to kaine said tuesday night before this mornings announcement about warner that the governor had seemed glum and believed that he would
4122014 the love of my life has passed me by my life is over
4122015 was consistently within the top 5 of his class as a whole
4122016 a source close to kaine said tuesday night before this mornings announcement about warner that the governor had seemed glum and believed that he would
4122017 the love of my life has passed me by my life is over
4122018 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
4122019 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
4122020 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
4122021 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
4122022 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
4122023 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
4122024 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
4122025 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
4122026 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
4122027 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4122028 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view

4122030 something has to happen and i really like this approach because it holds elected officials
4122031 george articulating a vision is easy i see cleveland as a midwest oasis of culture
4122032 george so what type of conversations actually inspire change in
4122033 meaningful acts how about defining the community we want to see i want to see a
4122034 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4122035 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4122036 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4122037 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4122038 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4122039 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4122040 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4122041 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him

4122043 it now appears that an effort may be under way to depose georgias duly elected government russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
4122044 there can be no talks with the organizers of genocide
4122045 saakashvili was crazy enough to go in the middle of the night and bomb a city
4122046 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed 10 ossetian villages at once who ran over elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilians alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
4122047 analyzing all the data on the web the content links and transactions between people and computers
4122048 flirting with the unthinkable of qualifying round elimination at the hands of champions league novices
4122049 at least this was actually in dutch rather than the bizarre and amusing heavily accented pidgin english mcclaren appears to adopt in interviews these days
4122050 i live and die by my decisions and i stand by my team selection
4122051 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4122052 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4122053 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4122054 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4122055 to pose with a wink to our participation in beijing
4122056 we thought it was something appropriate and that it would always be interpreted as somewhat loving
4122057 it was a gesture of affection and identification with the chinese people
4122058 my real age is 16 i dont pay any attention to what everyone says
4122059 never has any media outlet called me to check the athletes ages
4122060 we are a sports department how would we have the ability to do that
4122061 we already explained this very clearly theres no need to discuss this thing again
4122062 im going to take a look at the video i know theres a couple things i can work on throughout semis and finals everyone is going to keep going faster
4122063 you look at bernard and sullivan and theyve been performing at their best for six months now so theyre on the top
4122064 its up to us older folks to come in there and slip it away from them
4122065 its something ive never experienced swimming two different races in the same day especially coming off such a big final
4122066 but i think i coped well got through the heats well and got a lot more in store for tomorrow
4122067 but if you dont believe youre going to swim fast and you can do it just dont come out and swim because youre not going to give yourself a chance
4122068 of the four chinese people in the van two were injured and two died after being treated in hospital
4122069 our perception is that we may be passing the peak of construction costs cycle
4122070 we will be retendering contracts to see if we can get some costs out as contractors become more eager to price business keenly
4122071 the sharp rise in reos combined with slow sales has resulted in a bloated inventory of bank owned properties for sale
4122072 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4122073 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4122074 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4122075 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4122076 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4122077 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4122078 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4122079 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4122080 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4122081 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4122082 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4122083 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4122084 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4122085 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4122086 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4122087 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4122088 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4122089 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4122090 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4122091 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4122092 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4122093 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4122094 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4122095 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4122096 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4122097 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4122098 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4122099 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4122100 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4122101 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4122102 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4122103 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
4122104 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
4122105 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
4122106 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
4122107 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
4122108 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
4122109 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
4122110 just so you all know we did set a record
4122111 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
4122112 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4122113 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
4122114 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
4122115 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
4122116 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
4122117 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
4122118 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
4122119 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
4122120 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
4122121 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4122122 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
4122123 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4122124 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
4122125 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
4122126 its like i imagine being a man its like being kicked in the nuts repeatedly thats how bad it feels you feel like you want to curl up and die
4122127 im trying to put it all in perspective immediately its not so easy but its just really tough you train so long and i feel like i disappointed myself my coach my family my country everybody
4122128 clearly more americans chose to stay close to home in june than in previous years
4122129 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
4122130 i think people have started to take the increase in gas prices somewhat more in stride
4122131 more americans age 50 plus are trying to leave their cars behind but face obstacles as soon as they walk out the door climb on their bikes or head for the bus
4122132 so many people are being hurt by these high gas prices and it just caught america by surprise they just werent ready for these adjustments that need to be made
4122133 there is at least one silver lining in whats otherwise fairly painful news and that is that less driving means less air pollution and fewer global warming emissions
4122134 the move was created to allow more chances to deserving players and teams from the plate division and in effect make the ranji trophy a more open tournament
4122135 well very nice you know very cheering for us to hear that but ok its time to pass from this from words to deeds
4122136 camera an amazing video camera not much bigger than a pack of cigarettes
4122137 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4122138 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4122139 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4122140 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4122141 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4122142 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4122143 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4122144 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4122145 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4122146 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4122147 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4122148 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4122149 it pains us to take this measure however we need to avoid placing undue burden on our company and our service
4122150 one can always question decisions made in the course of refereeing but in sports it is appropriate to show sportsmanship and accept the results
4122151 i was not thinking about winning two gold medals at two consecutive olympics i was just focused on doing my best in beijing
4122152 many many of our subjects saw 100 per cent pass rates
4122153 classical civilisation maths chemistry french the list just goes on we are very pleased with our a level results it caps a pretty successful year
4122154 the examinations have changed from what they were in the past some of these students took their first a level exams after just three months of study
4122155 sitting modular tests shows what students need to do to improve whereas when i took mine you did two years studying and then found out where you were
4122156 i really wasnt sure if i would get in i was extremely nervous it was probably unfounded but you cant help worrying ive wanted to go to cambridge for the last few years i really like the city
4122157 nearly 99 per cent of our students passed these important exams our best ever our a to c figure was substantially increased over 2007 with about two thirds achieving these grades we congratulate the hard work of our students four of our students achieved grade a in every subject they sat
4122158 ill be going up there in the next couple of weeks to sort out my accommodation and find a job to pay my way its an exciting time
4122159 ill be celebrating with a meal out this lunchtime and then going out with a few mates to town tonight
4122160 jonathan couldnt continue with french at a2 here so we contacted wickersley comprehensive and found a way to accomodate his needs its a great example of schools working in tandem and its worked out very well
4122161 weve got 98 per cent a to e grades weve got a large number of students with three or more straight as
4122162 we are delighted with the work students and staff have put in and the support we get from parents and carers
4122163 i was really nervous because you can never be sure im really looking forward to it im very excited
4122164 firstly lets congratulate those students who have achieved another round of excellent results this year
4122165 we all recognise the hard work of students parents and carers teachers and staff in achieving these sucesses
4122166 a levels are an important step along the way for these young people and shape the future for many of them i hope these results mean more of our young people go on to higher education training or employment to fulfill their potential
4122167 when faced with the reality of your exam results please dont panic
4122168 whatever grades youve got whether better or worse than expected you still have a wide choice of things to do and there is no reason why you cant still go on to pursue your chosen career
4122169 we cant travel without passports theres no point the plane has left and tsvangirai has already gone back he has no patience for this
4122170 oh yes of course we got our independence after how many talks
4122171 why did you just do that this guy could have killed us
4122172 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
4122173 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
4122174 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
4122175 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
4122176 theres frustration there because theyre watching these childish ad campaigns and they know exactly how to answer it but theyre powerless to do so
4122177 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
4122178 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
4122179 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
4122180 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
4122181 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
4122182 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
4122183 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4122184 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
4122185 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
4122186 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
4122187 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
4122188 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
4122189 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
4122190 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4122191 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4122192 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4122193 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4122194 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4122195 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4122196 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4122197 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4122198 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4122199 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4122200 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
4122201 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
4122202 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
4122203 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
4122204 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4122205 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4122206 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4122207 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4122208 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4122209 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
4122210 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
4122211 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
4122212 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
4122213 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
4122214 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
4122215 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
4122216 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
4122217 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
4122218 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
4122219 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
4122220 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
4122221 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
4122222 ich mache themen die etwas schwieriger zu recherchieren sind in denen man es etwa mit einem klagefreudigen umfeld zu tun hat
4122223 wenn man sich einmal in ein thema eingearbeitet hat dann bleibt man dabei auch weil man die presserechtlichen details kennt
4122224 der stadt anzeiger hat das ph nomen seit den 1980er jahren konsequent untersch tzt
4122225 die neuen rechten gerieren sich ja gern als durch die systempresse unterdr ckte wenn man sie totschweigen wollte w rde das also gut in ihr verfolgungsmuster passen
4122226 wie d nn bei pro k ln die schicht der wohlanst ndigkeit ist
4122227 uns ist wichtig dass wir selbst den anlass f r berichterstattung setzen und uns von pro k ln nicht die themen vorgeben lassen
4122228 so behauptete pro k ln mit der npd nichts zu tun zu haben obschon die nordrhein westf lische npd selbst im internet ver ffentlicht hatte demonstrationen von pro k ln unterst tzt oder mit organisiert zu haben
4122229 unsere recherchen zeigen dass ihre behauptung in der mitte der gesellschaft angekommen zu sein falsch ist
4122230 hat einer gespuckt geschlagen gab es eine falsche eidesstattliche versicherung l gt jemand mit wem arbeitet einer zusammen
4122231 bei vertretern der etablierten parteien wie fdp oder cdu w rde ich das genauso machen
4122232 gerade bei pro nrw sind u erst fragw rdige leute beteiligt
4122233 dort gab es auch leute die komplett neben der spur waren
4122234 das wabert dann durchs netz das kann man nicht kontrollieren
4122235 die stehen ein f r demokratie die haben eine sensibilit t f r das thema
4122236 da braucht man geduld da muss man puzzeln und die schlagen einen nicht
4122237 man hat schon immer gedacht dass da irgend etwas nicht stimmt
4122238 wir haben mit den leuten gesprochen die haben uns einfach angelogen
4122239 die haben fr hmorgens in die verteilten ausgaben des vlothoer anzeigers ihre flugbl tter gesteckt
4122240 er warf uns vor einen gast des ch als rechtskr ftig verurteilten holocaust leugner bezeichnet zu haben der sei aber nur ein abgeurteilter volksverhetzer
4122241 es gibt auch im umgang mit der extremen rechten ein arbeitsumfeld f r pressevertreter
4122242 der muss auch mit trainern und spielern sprechen um informiert zu sein
4122243 es hat sich in den vergangenen jahren viel ge ndert
4122244 es bringt nichts mehr die rechten zu verschweigen wenn die ihre eigenen medien haben
4122245 ein moderner videoclip auf youtube hei t nicht dass sie in der szene nicht meinungen von 1933 haben
4122246 sie berichten umfangreich zu aktionen und gegenaktivit ten und kritisieren h ufig die unt tigkeit von polizei und justiz
4122247 gruppierungen wie pro k ln konnten sich so als anwalt des volkes auff hren
4122248 als die zur gro demo gegen den bau aufriefen kamen ganze 150 leute
4122249 man kann doch unabh ngig von pro k ln f r oder gegen etwas sein
4122250 das berregionale medieninteresse wird gewaltig sein und mit dem schub werden wir unmittelbar in den vorwahlkampf f r die kommunalwahlen 2009 einsteigen
4122251 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4122252 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4122253 a sudden and drastic reduction in the availability of credit
4122254 the distance travelled from the place where food is produced to the place where it is eaten considered in terms of the environmental damage that transporting it entails
4122255 a tax imposed with the intention of discouraging activities that may damage the environment
4122256 a small scale environmentally friendly settlement designed for sustainable living
4122257 the impact of human activity measured in terms of the amount of carbon dioxide it causes to be emitted into the atmosphere
4122258 the temporary failure of an item of clothing to do its job in covering a part of the body that it would be advisable to keep covered
4122259 its way too early to know which if any of these technologies is going to be practical
4122260 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
4122261 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
4122262 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
4122263 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
4122264 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
4122265 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
4122266 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
4122267 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand

4122270 at the height of the housebuilding market which was only nine months ago we had utilisation rates of 95 to 98 now in the depths of gloom were only down to 90

4122277 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
4122278 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world

4122284 come avete visto nemmeno agli stranieri permesso dire o fare nulla pubblicamente che leda minimamente limmagine positiva che la cina vuole dimostrare al mondo se manifestano su qualsiasi argomento sono immediatamente deportati e non loro concesso il visto di rientro per tutta la vita ovviamente xinjiang e tibet sono chiusi ai giornalisti ma i cinesi non ti dicono mai di no si inventano solo una scusa dopo laltra questo un atteggiamento che spesso gli occidentali non capiscono credono di potere ottenere qualcosa urlando pi forte non cos tutto studiato un vecchio amico di pechino mi ha detto prova pure ad andare a kashgar scommetto che quando ti starai per imbarcare si inventeranno una scusa e non ti faranno partire questa la cina di oggi
4122285 i cinesi amano le olimpiadi qui non si fa sport per divertimento ma per salvaguardare lonore nazionale vincere loro vuol dire dimostrare la grandezza della madrepatria se da te si aspettano loro e tu prendi largento sei un atleta finito per i cittadini poi le olimpiadi sono una specie di festa nazionale attesa da 100 anni come ha ripetuto loro incessantemente il governo sono la celebrazione della cina e tutti vogliono partecipare in qualche modo c gente che ha venduto tutti i suoi beni per pagarsi il viaggio fino a pechino solo per stare magari fuori dallo stadio a godersi la festa
4122286 per essere la nazione con il maggior numero di medaglie conquistate hanno obbligato molti ragazzini ad allenarsi in tutte le discipline qui gli atleti non sempre scelgono lo sport la disciplina viene assegnata sono fortissimi nei tuffi nella ginnastica nel tennis tavolo nel badminton da questanno hanno atleti forti anche nel nuoto e nella scherma
4122287 le olimpiadi sono levento del momento seguito minuziosamente si parla anche degli atleti stranieri ma i pi seguiti sono chiaramente gli atleti cinesi ad esempio si accenna soltanto al fenomeno michael phelps ma quando la cina ha perso nel basket contro gli usa in maniera catastrofica i giornali hanno riportato che stato un match equilibrato e che solo alla fine la cina ha perso a causa della caviglia dolorante di yao ming
4122288 ma scherziamo questa una dittatura tutti i cinesi sanno benissimo che internet censurato e convivono con la situazione di quello che succede in tibet o nello xinjiang non sanno nulla a parte che ci sono terroristi orribili che vogliono fare del male alla grande madrepatria con laiuto di cospiratori stranieri
4122289 i turisti che hanno raggiunto la citt per seguire i giochi sono meno rispetto al solito comunque sempre pi giovani italiani arrivano a pechino in cerca di fortuna economica fuggendo da un paese come litalia dove trovare lavoro diventato un miracolo

4122292 lindsay lohan is all pissy today because of rumors that her 14 year old sister ali got breast implants
4122293 this is not to be confused with the outrage the lohans felt when lindsay was rumored to be in a gay relationship with sam ronson or that lindsay had a coke habit or that lindsay was in rehab this is different

4122325 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
4122326 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
4122327 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
4122328 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm

4122542 i am taking xenical in combination with a low fat diet and exercise i have lost 11 lbs in three weeks so far so good i have found that increasing your fiber intake with a fiber supplement helps minimize gastrointestinal problems that may occur
4122543 i took xenical for about 2 months its basically a fat blocker to absorb the fat intake in your food i lost 7 pounds but you also have to watch your diet just because you take xenical doesnt mean you should drive through mcdonalds you will get major diarrhea if you eat too much fat
4122544 xenical wut it does its it reduces the fat that you eat it doesnt help u to look skinny right away or anything all it does is it eliminates your fat intakes
4122545 the only side effect i have had has been a bit of gastric but nothing else and that was only because my meals obviously contained too much fat i havent gone off them just have been more careful in what i eat now and eating foods that have less fat in them
4122546 xenical has some nasty side effects you might want to check into before taking it one of those is pooping in your pants with little or no notice dont that sound like fun
4122547 i took xenical about 6 or 7 years ago and it just made me gastrically sick i basically lost weight because i was too afraid to eat anything because it made me run to the toilet every time i did i was only on it for a week and lost about 3 kgs but i would strongly advise against it unless they have refined the product over the last few years to remove this side effect

4122606 as a realist someone who understands how this world works i understand why people revert to violence of every sort not just physical but psychological and economic and political and religious but it is never right for the believer who looks at the world and why they do what they do violence may be an understandable option but for them it is never the final resort this is only true for believers only they are free to not return violence for violence the actions of self giving of love of sacrifice of dying are the true violations of this world system
4122607 the liberal soul shall be made fat and he that watereth shall be watered also himself

4122609 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4122610 they introduced themselves and at that time he pulled out a handgun and shot chairman gwatney several times
4122611 if we move forward aggressively with the policy of producing more american energy and conserving more american energy and show the world that were serious about the supply side that will lead to further reduction in the price of oil
4122612 and that will take pressure off the economy which is really reeling from the huge increase in energy costs
4122613 we have not lost a single life to nuclear power in this country
4122614 we are running nuclear power plants all over this country and were running a navy thats nuclear generated so we know how to deal with nuclear energy we know how to make it safe and we know how to produce it
4122615 yes nuclear power plants have a life expectancy and at the end of their life expectancy they get shut down
4122616 if they can do it safely they should do it

4122619 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4122620 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4122621 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4122622 and also i feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together
4122623 you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily would rule tom ridge out
4122624 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice
4122625 and i think ridge is a great example of that
4122626 far more so than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights you know a number of other issues

4122660 thermal scalpel has been damaged as a result of defendants infringing conduct
4122661 defendants are this liable to thermal scalpel in an amount that adequately compensates it for their infringements which by law cannot be less than a reasonable royalty together with interest and costs as fixed by this court
4122662 this is not the first suit versata has been forced to bring against defendants
4122663 versata has recently discovered that contrary to the provisions of the settlement agreement defendants have been making presentations to potential business targets regarding the terms of the settlement agreement
4122664 in fact defendants have been disclosing and misrepresenting the terms of the settlement agreement in attempting to win business in direct competition with versata
4122665 such misrepresentations were made at a minimum to chrysler during a sales pitch by defendants that ultimately had the effect of winning the chrysler account from versata
4122666 defendants are well aware of the terms of the settlement agreement yet nonetheless are competing against versata by misrepresenting the scope of their license in order to assuage concerns client may have that their technical solutions infringe versatas intellectual property
4122667 as a result defendants were able to lure at least one client away from versata and could steal more if this wrongdoing is allowed to continue

4122670 t o put it as bluntly as possible christian theology at once insists on the necessity of a historical examination of its own founding narrative and simultaneously insists on the necessity that such an examination produce affirmative results
4122671 i am proposing in other words a trial separation preparatory to an amicable divorce those of us who study the earliest christians are clearly studying them in two radically different ways for radically different reasons perhaps it is time to divide our furniture and move it into separate dwellings with confessional institutions exclusively responsible for edifying interpretation including historically based interpretation of the new testament and with non confessional institutions particularly state funded universities exclusively responsible for using all of the available data including textual data to provide comprehensible non obfuscatory explanations for the development permutations and attractions of the christian movement

4122674 the large overall monthly gain was once again attributable to gasoline prices which jumped 4 1 per cent in the month
4122675 some relief may be in the offing on indications that gasoline prices moved lower in august though the annual rate of inflation is likely to remain above 5 5 per cent through the third quarter which will likely keep the fed wary

4122692 as often occurs during a major release of a new technology platform and as previously disclosed by the company power medical has encountered challenges that have slowed the rate of adoption of its new technology
4122693 this has resulted in post launch revenues that have been lower than expected and affected the companys gross margins during the first six months of 2008
4122694 i believe this is also good news for the industry
4122695 big potential to expand globally so that should be the focus

4122751 up until fairly recently diablo ii was blizzards best selling game
4122752 world of warcraft has finally surpassed it but it took it several years to do that and part of the reason is how approachable the game is
4122753 its one of the reasons why we made some of the choices we made like when we pulled out the potion system
4122754 when we wanted to add a hot bar we knew we had to pull the potion stuff out every time we add something we have to pull something out to keep the game very simple and straightforward to play
4122755 was the player was faster than most of the monsters and had pretty much infinite health because they would just pop as many potions as they wanted so when you have a player who has more mobility more health and endless power essentially the only thing you can really do to challenge them is to kill them by just spiking the difficulty
4122756 when the player has similar downsides it means we can make a lot more interesting monsters we dont have to kill you to challenge you we can make a monster that affects your mobility we can make a monster that has different kinds of attacks that are dangerous to you and that you actually have to avoid and so it makes the combat a lot more interesting
4122757 a lot of the choices we make are styled towards knowing the long term
4122758 i think that hardcore players long term will find a game that has lot more depth for them but we distinctly made the choice that in the first stage of difficulty the games really easy so its easy to get through its fun to play and you can kind of spam with one skill but as you get further and further into the game you start having to go okay now ive really got to use this ground stomp thing to stun some monsters and get some distance from them to recover thats something that we focus on more later in the game

4122767 i know sometimes in these days and times we see these senseless tragedies i hope we can learn the facts of this
4122768 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away

4122785 showing that in any given year unionization raised inflation adjusted per pupil spending by 12 3 percent compared with nonunion districts the only thing taxpayers have gotten for the extra billions weve poured into education is more unionized employees
4122786 the unions dues or agency fees by the way are taken directly out of teachers paychecks by most school districts
4122787 hundreds of other employees earn six figure incomes in addition to their extremely generous benefits

4122801 70 percent higher than the national average while their dropout rate is a whopping 42 percent and their average sat score is more than 220 points below the national average
4122802 the unions lobbying worked in the senate the d c voucher proposals would not go away
4122803 poll of d c residents show ed that 56 percent of district residents wanted school choice those who stood to benefit most from vouchers that is poor parents who could not afford to get their children out of the failing public schools supported school choice even more strongly 65 percent of african americans with incomes under 50 000 favored the plan
4122804 nearly a decade after the first d c voucher program was introduced but the teachers unions and their democratic partners did not give up even after this vote dont bank on vouchers coming to d c senator kennedy said
4122805 they also have a positive public image from representing teachers that much of labor lacks
4122806 capitalize on the image of their members the humble hardworking american teacher
4122807 not a union but rather an innocuous professional association controlled by and made up mostly of school administrators
4122808 by the 1970s the nea had kicked out its administrator members and adopted policies sanctioning strikes and the internal revenue service irs had officially designated it as a union
4122809 the aft and the nea have given teaching the feel of classic blue collar work where winning workers big checks for the shortest possible hours has been the aim and the quality of the product is considered to be managements worry
4122810 the only thing taxpayers have gotten for the extra billions weve poured into education is more unionized employees

4122831 the line of craters left by the alleged russian attacks runs through the middle of a hilly mostly uninhabited plain some 15 miles south of tbilisi near the town of rustavi the area lacks military or even human targets the only sign of civilization is a small farm surrounded by haystacks and grazing herds of cows and sheep the 45 craters each some 60 feet across scar the hillside like footprints left by a giant

4122862 i dont think it tells us very much more than wealthier people and higher social classes live in the south west and the south east though that doesnt detract from the achievements of students in these areas
4122863 there are also many more independent and selective schools in the southern part of the country and any additional improvement in selective schools is bound to be reflected in regional statistics
4122864 i heartily congratulate all students who have successfully completed their a levels and thank teachers for their hard work
4122865 more pupils are now passing maths a level than at any time in over a decade its crucial for society that we have talented mathematicians and maths is essential for science and innovation
4122866 todays results for science and maths a levels give us reason to be encouraged
4122867 maths and further maths have continued their robust recovery with the numbers of students taking these a levels increasing for the fifth year in a row this is a welcome pay off for the serious efforts made in recent years to boost this subject

4122869 i am delighted to support heinekens global quantum of solace marketing campaign heineken has done a great job in making james bond camille and the world of bond connect with their iconic international brand

4122874 yesterday i had my house repossessed at approximately 8 30am about seven men broke down my door and told me i hadnt kept up the repayments and therefore they would be taking all my belongings the house was now the property of the bank i ended up on the street with my girlfriend and child everything is just borrowed i guess
4122875 they get excited for different reasons here in china it seems like
4122876 theyre quite sad you didnt make the ball over the net
4122877 on a double fault youre like ok double faults happen
4122878 but theyre like oh no how bad for the guy so its actually quite a unique experience its a different cultural experience in a way honestly i enjoy it
4122879 the longer the point went you know the happier they were
4122880 sometimes they get quite excited during the point which is quite distracting for us
4122881 but its very difficult to explain to them in chinese during the point we are really fighting hard to play each ball and you hear such loud applause during it and you kind of get confused
4122882 now it actually makes me get excited theyre so into the point its actually kind of cool
4122883 however with a clear focus on the future we continue to work on new product introductions and marketing efforts to position mti instruments for increased sales when general economic conditions improve
4122884 while our low prices are undoubtedly more important than ever new customers attracted to asda for the first time have been impressed by the quality of our fresh food and the choice thats now available
4122885 abkhaz has its obligations to the people of south ossetia and it is fulfilling them
4122886 maybe in order to achieve our goals we will have to violate certain parts of the moscow agreement of may 14 1994 on a ceasefire but we were not the first to violate them
4122887 full demilitarisation in the security zone of detachments and units of the defence ministry interior forces police border police and other security structures of georgia
4122888 in the event that armed groups refuse to give up their weapons all necessary measures will be taken
4122889 by its actions in south ossetia georgia showed that in reality it wants to see the resolution of both the georgian ossetian and the georgian abkhaz conflicts only by force
4122890 so sukhums actions in the kodori gorge is not just about keeping our partnership agreements with tskhinval its an act of deterrence sooner or later the georgian military contingent stationed in the kodori gorge would have been used against abkhazia
4122891 after the west did not react for several days to the georgian artillery levelling tskhinval it became completely obvious to us that nobody needs either the abkhaz or the ossetians
4122892 no one except russia is planning to defend us thats why we are accepting the big increase in the russian military presence in abkhazia calmly they are guaranteeing our security
4122893 its quite a surreal treat to sunbathe on the beach with russian warships lined up in the port
4122894 i dont think any tourist firm would offer that and if they did it would be only for lots of money

4122908 he had problems figuring out how to explain it to his wife and children
4122909 these wives are accustomed to seeing their husbands as strong but now theyre weak and vulnerable
4122910 women typically if theyve lived one particular lifestyle assume that their husband should just solve the problem
4122911 many times women cant cope with the fact that a man can be emotional and fragile
4122912 firms really can not afford to lose their intellectual capital the labor force is growing more slowly most likely additional labor is not going to be plentiful in the next few years and firms know that if they lay workers off now they will be facing labor shortages two or three years down the road

4122914 the thai general cargo ship was hijacked in the gulf of aden on august 12 by somali pirates

4122934 if i so choose i can depart this world entirely it is not death which makes this possible but it is change of mind about the purpose of the world if i believe it has a value as i see it now so will it still remain for me but if i see no value in the world as i behold it nothing that i want to keep as mine or search for as a goal it will depart from me for i have not sought for illusions to replace the truth

4122936 father it is today that i am free because my will is yours i thought to make another will yet nothing that i thought apart from you exists and i am free because i was mistaken and did not affect my own reality at all by my illusions now i give them up and lay them down before the feet of truth to be removed forever from my mind this is my holy instant of release father i know my will is one with yours
4122937 all across the north i am hearing legitimate concerns being raised by property owners in unincorporated areas regarding the impact these changes will have on their property taxes and whether their taxes will be used to improve badly needed local services
4122938 with the implementation date for the new system approaching quickly i think it is time that the mcguinty government ends all this uncertainty and starts providing specifics
4122939 all provincial land taxes collected go directly to ontarios general revenue fund and in effect the money is shared by all the residents of ontario even with the present system it is very difficult to determine whether these funds are actually being used for services in unincorporated areas and with a potential huge increase in taxes it is quite understandable that residents are demanding clarification
4122940 its time to vote the effect of matching message orientation and temporal frame on political persuasion
4122941 imagine taking a vacation to cancun six months from now you are probably thinking about beaches sunsets and other abstract information on the other hand if you were going to cancun tomorrow you would be thinking about taxi cabs and boarding passes concrete concerns making you more likely to process information about speedy check in or the phone number of a taxi
4122942 similarly a voter facing a choice in the distant future is less interested in particular plans and policies and is more persuaded by broad abstract ideas it is only as the election gets closer that voters start paying attention to concrete details of the candidates positions in essence when the choice is far away a voter is more likely to think in abstract terms but as the choice approaches the voter puts more weight on the details
4122943 what this finding implies is that the people who typically decide elections voters in the middle are most susceptible to this type of persuasion political novices tend to be more persuaded by abstract messages when the choice is far off and by concrete messages when the choice is imminent
4122944 the fit of the right message with the right voter at the right time has never been more important to the outcome of a race
4122945 gtg is very excited to work with chesapeake on their gis plan
4122946 chesapeake has experienced years of gis success and wants to move to a fully integrated enterprise wide implementation to that end they have decided to create a plan that will lay out a step by step outline on how to make it happen gtg has had the opportunity of working with neighboring suffolk and virginia beach and understands the needs of local governments in the area the staff at chesapeake are very forward thinking and will undoubtedly ensure that their gis efforts are second to none
4122947 aerial photography gives us important intelligence for managing the response to incidents and investigating incident scenes
4122948 although it is early days of implementation within our command and control operations we feel it will be a great asset in ensuring we can optimise resources and provide a fast and effective response
4122949 it is not always possible to obtain aerial views of an ongoing incident scene

4122954 this new research is tremendously exciting as firstly the biological brain controls its own moving robot body and secondly it will enable us to investigate how the brain learns and
4122955 this research will move our understanding forward of how brains work and could have a profound effect on many areas of science and medicine
4122956 one of the fundamental questions that scientists are facing today is how we link the activity of individual neurons with the complex behaviors that we see in whole organisms
4122957 this project gives us a really unique opportunity to look at something which may exhibit complex behaviors but still remain closely tied to the activity of individual neurons

4122984 i was rolling with a certain hollywood figure who may or may not have been aforementioned as a guest singer on this record and this tattoo artist i was rolling with in order to keep her in my life as my friend it meant the end of the potential for another aspect of our relationship so it was more of a disappointment
4122985 thats the worst kind of heartbreak in a way because it was the heartbreak of being an adult
4122986 i get off the phone with this girl and i said out loud f now im a f ing fool
4122987 i dont care what anybody says when youre hanging out with celebrities you never expect to get involved with them emotionally no matter how much you like them
4122988 this album is kind of i hate to sound corny but its kind of a mature look at hollywood
4122989 i fell in love with hollywood the city itself in a randy newman sort of way so i guess the album is about a variety of things di swinging in hollywood and acting tougher than you really might be

4123031 i walked in last monday morning thinking it was bad enough we just lost our third in a row but at least my family are all safe
4123032 i just saw this young man with our football manager and i thought oh no i dont like this players dont have to be in until about nine oclock and i thought this is not good
4123033 the reason why im involved is that i believe in second chances quite frankly
4123034 when we look at our own life its generally when we have a hiccup when we are at our lowest ebb that we take stock and try to work out which way to go
4123035 yes young people have got to stand on their own two feet but sometimes they need that little bit of support in society we cant do it by ourselves
4123036 what we are trying to do is promote opportunity for all once the kid has served his time once he is rehabilitated the next stage of rehabilitation is normality
4123037 its an error of judgement they are terrific kids they all know what theyve done we have got to be careful we dont murder them for that mistake
4123038 youve got to understand the background of where these kids come from some of the problems these kids have got
4123039 believe me when they come in to us for all intents and purposes weve got ourselves a decent law abiding citizen but there are always idiosyncrasies that emerge and we are dealing with that all the time
4123040 weve elected to be pretty harsh on shaw and didak this is one of the harshest penalties ever we hope it will have a great effect on those kids
4123041 its had a profound effect i believe already on those kids and certainly on the rest of the group
4123042 by showing that sort of strength and fairness we think well get those players back in the fold
4123043 como principiante espero que las recomendaciones y criticas me ayuden a crecer como mago
4123044 hes jumping out of his skin but if you could get some of your mates to do a rain dance for me that would be great the more the better
4123045 on paper hes not up to weight for age but on the other hand he got 58 kilograms in the open handicap hes won his last three in the city so why not take the chance
4123046 when other kids had bikes i had ponies thats pretty much how it was
4123047 i came to melbourne with him in the spring of 1980 and he won the mercedes benz cup on caulfield cup day we took him to perth and back to sydney and he won races but we ended up settling back in melbourne that year
4123048 i had a few in work myself and spent a bit of time helping out other trainers i used to clock horses for tony vasil when he started out
4123049 we bought him at the magic millions sales from newhaven park stud for 20 000
4123050 hes what you call a naughty horse he loves to strut his stuff
4123051 he likes to have a go and attack things and thats how he races too attacking from the front
4123052 it looks like im going to stay im pretty sure ill stay with the belgians
4123053 if they cant do that well maybe then i wont stay but they are looking to do that and are pulling out all stops like never before
4123054 im disappointed i suppose being close to a medal the bronze
4123055 i thought id get third at least but i gave it all i had at the time all things considered it wasnt a bad ride
4123056 otherwise im a bit disappointed to be leaving actually i was kind of enjoying it the games
4123057 it was a particular course i have never done a time trial with a downhill so straight and long we never race on freeways

4123059 a serious public problem had been growing in the body of christ revolving around concerns about lakeland from respected leaders
4123060 bob jones prophesied that on june 22 the outpouring would increase so much that it would appear that the revival would really begin at that time of course no one knew that june 23 the day after june 22 would be the date of todds apostolic alignment which could well be the event to release increased spiritual power
4123061 i was receiving a quantity of email correspondence from other apostles who were interested i opened the door for those who desired to accompany us on the platform i did not allow prophets evangelists pastors or teachers to join the group apostles only
4123062 a few of us met with todd personally before the service and we found him to be a wonderful individual doris and i had never met him before i explained to him what the ceremony would be like and he agreed we were on the same page in fact we like each other
4123063 some have thought that todd is aligned with me which is not the case he is not a member of ica we are barely aquainted
4123064 my name is peter wagner and i have served the body of christ in apostolic ministry for many years and currently i preside over the international coalition of apostles which brings together over 500 recognized apostles i have the honor of being assigned to preside over this momentous occasion this is a ceremony celebrating the formal apostolic alignment of todd bentley this commissioning represents a powerful spiritual transaction taking place in the invisible world with this in mind i take the apostolic authority that god has given me and i decree to todd bentley your power will increase your authority will increase your favor will increase your influence will increase your revelation will increase
4123065 ch ahn was in charge of this i want to make it clear that i did not commission todd as some wrongly think i didnt lay on hands i didnt anoint with oil in fact i moved to the back and neither my wife doris nor i prayed or prophesied
4123066 we were the favorite based on our individual performance but its really hard to deal with that type of expectations of everybody else i think that we needed to work on our focus a little bit more
4123067 im upset but its important not to get too upset right now at this moment because we still have a chance for a bronze medal and we need to concentrate on that
4123068 i was having difficulties we just couldnt hold on were going to go regroup and hopefully well be able to pull ourselves together
4123069 so i think they could have had better momentum but you have to be ready for everyone and we werent ready

4123072 new medical data from 2006 and 2007 convinced the board that an even bigger increase is necessary the rating bureau says the rate must jump by 10 8 just to cover rising medical costs california work comp insurance rating board communications director jack hannan said the governing board in its last two filing recommendations adjusted pure premium rate recommendations based on an assumption of 1 medical inflation he said the board believes the inflation trend in medical costs is actually closer to an increase of 5 per year emphasis added hannan could not say specifically what area of medicine is spurring the rise in costs but he said the bureau hopes to have a breakdown by the time the insurance department holds hearings on the rate recommendation in september

4123074 i dont trust the national organizations because they seem to try and keep me out of the loop

4123078 the advantage of this technology over other solar power generation technologies is the ability to store thermal energy at the point of collection and hold it before converting it to electricity
4123079 ergon energy has interest in the completion of this project for both network augmentation and efficiency reasons
4123080 the development of the power station would negate the need for a network upgrade potentially achieving significant cost savings the power station will also help reduce ergon energys carbon footprint and bring significant benefits to the environment

4123084 if you try to drill at the edge of known technology under the bosporus and you run into problems your machine could be lost then there is only one solution start again
4123085 you allow the contractor more freedom to design the project so that it suits its construction methods

4123121 strengthening social securitys solvency while protecting middle class families from benefit cuts tax increases or increases in the retirement age
4123122 wrong and tears at the fabric of social security the very idea of mutual responsibility by subjecting a secure earned retirement to the whims of the market
4123123 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4123124 and also i feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together
4123125 you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily would rule tom ridge out
4123126 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice
4123127 and i think ridge is a great example of that
4123128 far more so than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights you know a number of other issues
4123129 i dont think that anything is going to change but i do think it is important to be heard and this is our way of doing it

4123138 there are still certain risks that we dont want to take

4123143 i think the one that is set to go as soon as the financing falls into place is the jamaica project the characters are black jamaicans in kingston in the early 60s
4123144 in the jamaican story i think the situation of the characters is much more endearing and likable than my past films and so i really hope that itll be a breakout film in terms of popularity weve gone back to the original title which is dancing mood we called it creation for a while itll have a lot of music but its not really about music and i think the characters are ingratiating and funny and i really hope financing will line up and well be able to do that soon
4123145 that contract has not been i think criterion is negotiating with one of the studios to bring it out but those negotiations are taking a very long time
4123146 i popped a benadryl but that didnt act fast enough my chest felt constricted and the people around me started to panic

4123149 it was more like a high school gymnasium with nearly 200 beds in it
4123150 people were screaming and crying the man lying to my right had a black leg the young girl to my left was having severe stomach pains and was screaming in agony there were no curtains to divide the beds and they were so close i could actually touch the person next to me if i wanted
4123151 tiny little nurse came over and said i give shot now i nodded and before i knew what was going on this little girl flipped me over pulled down my pants stuck the needle in my behind and flipped me back over again
4123152 given horse pill sized medicine which i had no clue what it was when the iv was finished i was given a small piece of paper and told i could go whenever i felt better

4123159 aggressively confronting the epidemic among latinos is one of cdcs highest hiv prevention priorities prevention efforts must be designed to reach a multi ethnic latino population
4123160 until they are very very sick and once diagnosed they dont take their medicine as prescribed even when they have access to life extending medicines
4123161 sense of all the variables that are affecting the trust or mistrust of medicine
4123162 from there we can develop means to build trust and better communicate the value of medical treatment to hispanics with hiv and preventive methods for those at risk of contracting hiv
4123163 b ased on mccains votes in the senate the answer to that is yes
4123164 question becomes will the pro life movement be able to persuade him otherwise between now and the election
4123165 indicated that stem cell research is in his words academic
4123166 need to use embryonic stem cells as the foundation of this particular line of research where we can move to the more recent advances and take away the tough decisions about life versus science
4123167 say the principle reason is that they are seldom sick
4123168 when it comes to latinos what may appear to be the well known effects of socioeconomic inequality on health care may also be conditioned by unique social cultural and economic circumstances
4123169 thats the real gap i think were facing the ability to provide a medical home for a spectrum of this population
4123170 as black as the devils heart and sweet as a stolen kiss
4123171 patient consumer involvement is critical to crafting informed balanced and effective health care decision making

4123178 we selected digital river as our e commerce partner because of its proven experience in the software industry and global e commerce markets

4123180 we know that women who smoke during pregnancy have smaller babies
4123181 this is an important finding and suggests that there appears to be a carry over effect of smoking from one pregnancy to another although the reasons for this are not clear it is important that we continue in our efforts to reduce cigarette smoking not only in women who are pregnant but also in our wider community
4123182 smoking is bad for your health whether you are pregnant or not it increases complications such as hypertension heart disease and lung cancer
4123183 as a doctor i would urge pregnant women to stop smoking as it harms the developing fetus every effort must be made to ensure that babies have the best start to their lives and this begins in the womb

4123222 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd
4123223 in june the canadian parliament had passed a motion that war resisters should be able to stay in canada it was a non binding motion but it expressed the will of parliament and the canadian people
4123224 ive had the opportunity to speak out against the war no offense to the soldiers over there i have respect for them as soldiers but it was a bogus war based on false pretenses and im happy to have not taken part in it

4123261 well you told me we were going to do this
4123262 if you needed my help you shouldve mentioned it when i told you about the 1st deadline last week or maybe when i told i got a week long extension
4123263 im not going to argue with you why does it matter how does your landlord know whats mine and whats yours

4123271 the purpose of the talk and the paper is to make clear just how dire the situation is and how rapidly things are getting worse
4123272 its a lot like the issue of climate change that we had ignored for so long if anything the situation in the oceans could be worse because we are so close to the precipice in many ways
4123273 all of the different kinds of data and methods of analysis point in the same direction of drastic and increasingly rapid degradation of marine ecosystems
4123274 just as we say that leatherback turtles are critically endangered i looked at entire ecosystems as if they were a species
4123275 the reality is that if we want to have coral reefs in the future were going to have to behave that way and recognize the magnitude of the response thats necessary to achieve it
4123276 the challenges of bringing these threats under control are enormously complex and will require fundamental changes in fisheries agricultural practices and the ways we obtain energy for everything we do
4123277 so its not a happy picture and the only way to deal with it is in segments the only way to keep ones sanity and try to achieve real success is to carve out sectors of the problem that can be addressed in effective terms and get on it as quickly as possible
4123278 im not ashamed of my behavior im not backing down

4123284 if i was doing this for the first time the stakes would be higher but my time with navman means we are in a strong position we see both our web service and the rp5 in a similar way one is a virtual product the other a physical product with the rp5 we want to free users from their computer screens and make good music equally enjoyable from a comfy chair
4123285 the home is a more social environment and we wanted to provide options of how where and which way you listen to music why limit your geography of content to uk we live in a cosmopolitan way and we can expand beyond our shores but simplicity is important we have adopted the radiopaq interface with the rp5 because it is learnt technology for many people it works well and we didnt want to reinvent the wheel and force users to work out a new interface we have added dab as we believe it is a complimentary technology too so we hope we have come up with an appealing product
4123286 im honored to have the endorsement of the american federation of school administrators and grateful for the commitment theyre making to help us win this november with afsas support im confident that with this election were going to begin bringing about a better future for all our children and for this country we love

4123300 i think its only natural that parents are going to act that way initially
4123301 youre talking about something that is probably the most important thing in their life indirectly theyre threatened because their kids have been threatened
4123302 let the kids know that what the teacher has written is important enough for you to read carefully
4123303 going directly to a classroom to question a teacher pulls time away from instruction goes against most school visitation policies and can cause a parent to be permanently banned from being on campus
4123304 you dont want to get in trouble so you dont exactly lie but you dont exactly tell the story as it was
4123305 the teacher said i just thought i knew nancy well enough to tease her she didnt realize that nancy was interpreting it that way
4123306 i always say i dont care what they say about me the first day of school but what they say about me at the last day of school
4123307 if the teacher thinks differently than your parental philosophy your child is learning more than you can teach her
4123308 if something doesnt feel right take it to the principal and ask that they conduct an investigation
4123309 give the school a chance to get to the bottom of the situation and find a solution
4123310 may you be seven times worse off this day 12 months from now you who cannot do without me for one day

4123321 if you look at the amount of money thats accumulated in transfer fees it speaks volumes of the career hes had
4123322 hes got fantastic mobility he is very clever and hes a goalscorer
4123323 we have to make sure we are up for the challenge
4123324 nottingham forest paid 2 65m and it shows he should be one of the main players in this division
4123325 i expect it to be a fantastic advert for championship football and a game that should be really open and full of good football
4123326 the two ideas of football were completely different last campaign but i think it is the same now
4123327 the pressure of forest winning promotion is off their shoulders now and they will come down here thinking they can win
4123328 we try to focus on every goal scored against us to see what we can do defensively in those situations
4123329 we trained a lot on monday especially those situations and will do more to make sure everything is 100 per cent

4123334 any and all loss liability claims demands causes of action or suits of any type related to smiths employment with sedc
4123335 if sedc is going to waive their rights against ms smith then the public needs to have had the ability to read the contract ahead of time and it needs to have been properly noticed
4123336 the argument can be made that there is a symbiosis between the city and sedc
4123337 it depends on a factual determination of who is covered by this release
4123338 the purpose of it is that she will get out of the relationship with the company thinking that she wont be sued by anybody
4123339 nothing in this release exonerates smith from responsibility or liability for smiths own wrongful act or omission

4123346 i bet the fire department had to sign ndas before entering
4123347 the idea that working with the kernel community is hard to me is a myth or at least a misconception
4123348 whenever you step into a large organized operation there are going to be some ground rules and if you ignore those rules you will find working with the community very hard
4123349 my goal was driven by talking with folks that wished they had something they could hand out to companies and developers to see how to participate and get their code into the kernel
4123350 there is a lot of disagreement between the kernel development community and certain vendors who dont see the reasons or the need to incorporate their code
4123351 one reason is that code in the mainline kernel tends to be higher quality code
4123352 there are persistent concerns about quality control with some people feeling that were spending too much time merging new stuff into the kernel and perhaps not enough time fixing stuff that is already there
4123353 thats not a universally held opinion and its really hard to come up with objective metrics on whether the kernel is becoming more buggy or less so
4123354 lets take route one yeah im feeling like route one
4123355 this was a top down deal between an employer and a hand picked union
4123356 there was a gag order on everyone and as a result this was a banana republic election
4123357 and the trouble is if you dont risk anything you risk even more
4123358 our aim is to target the most critical points related to the olympics
4123359 we will try to attack chinese central cities severely using tactics that have never been employed
4123360 the blast was indeed deliberate but had nothing to do with terrorist attacks
4123361 despite the turkistan islamic partys repeated warnings to china and the international community about stopping the 29th olympics in beijing the chinese have haughtily ignored our warnings
4123362 ive learned that people will forget what you said people will forget what you did but people will never forget how you made them feel
4123363 and im not saying we are reigniting the cold war but this is an act of aggression which we didnt think wed see in the 21st century
4123364 i also believe that we have to understand in the larger context of what this is all about and its all got to do with the centuries old ambitions of the russians to establish the russian empire
4123365 you got a guy who is ready to be president on day one who understands the world for what it is
4123366 the thing about senator obama hes playing catch up here his initial statements quite frankly didnt appreciate how bold a move this was from russia
4123367 senator mccain has talked for years about the dangers of russian policies in the way they conduct themselves and undermine the sovereignty of their neighbours
4123368 receives no compensation of any type from orion strategies and has not since may 15 2008
4123369 often focused on georgias aspirations to join nato and on legislative proposals including a measure co sponsored by mccain that supported georgias position on south ossetia
4123370 barack obama the administration and the nato allies took a measured reasoned approach
4123371 we were dealing with the facts as we knew them john mccain shot from the hip very aggressive belligerent statement he may or may not have complicated the situation
4123372 while this shouldnt matter and wouldnt if she was recording for the mccain campaign
4123373 i feel especially blessed to have been able to hear from and see all these wonderful people who have been my fans
4123374 through this entire ordeal their prayers and support have been so gratifying you have no idea what a strength the fans have been for me
4123375 he displayed the heart of the champion throughout all those signings
4123376 i dont know how he was able to get through them no matter how weak he felt he just kept signing i told him at one point we can cut this short bobby but he insisted on going the full nine innings there was so much love on those lines all those people who wanted to share their stories with him and i think that was what motivated him to keep on going he wanted them to know he loved them as much as they loved him
4123377 bobby murcer was a born yankee a great guy very well liked and a true friend of mine
4123378 i extend my deepest sympathies to his wife kay their children and grandchildren i will really miss the guy
4123379 i feel like i need to be traveling in the popemobile
4123380 it seemed like the stadium didnt want it to end
4123381 i was just praying at that point i think if i had popped it up to second he was still taking off for home
4123382 weve tried to do the best we could to keep this balanced
4123383 the white population is older and very much centered around the aging baby boomers who are well past their high fertility years
4123384 the future of america is epitomized by the young people today they are basically the melting pot we are going to see in the future
4123385 the position of the russia side is not proceed beyond the peacekeeping zone but we have to respond to provocations
4123386 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4123387 we dont want them here what we need is friendship and good relations with the russian people
4123388 we let her stay here and now shes blaming everything on us
4123389 thats the problem there was a lack of documentation a lack of oversight
4123390 you would think they would pay attention to every dollar
4123391 but jeez what an omen it was like walking under a ladder the cat wasnt scared it just walked around me and went through the dugout with leo durocher the chicago manager there
4123392 he looked right at leo and went underneath the stands the way that year went i thought it was planted
4123393 that was so cool when we saw it we thought who hired the cat did santo ask if it was radio controlled
4123394 i got bitten on the back when i was 5
4123395 we were going to take a victory lap and the next thing i know im down the left field line on a horse i havent gone back to see how i got there its pretty much a blank it happened so fast
4123396 beau was a trouper he allowed two people on his back and didnt try to buck me off i just saw the horse at a card show in yonkers two years ago it was a nice reunion
4123397 i dont know if thats a good thing or a bad thing
4123398 as long as ive got a jersey on my back thats fine with me
4123399 the fun thing about no 6 is i think it was the first number that was issued twice in team history and was actually issued three times in 1962
4123400 it did not appear on anybody of any note until al weis and he was a reserve infielder he did a nice job for the 69 team but was pretty undistinguished for the most part a replacement level backup shortstop
4123401 when you think of no 6 you can think of several dozen different players
4123402 its sort of the opposite of retiring a number its like theyre trying to circulate it as much as possible god forbid they should have someone wear it for several years in a row
4123403 consider this an idiot protection policy for those fans decent and mature enough to enjoy the event without getting trashed
4123404 for those that were used to overdoing it hopefully now they will get home safely
4123405 this program is plain and simple about respect respect for oneself and one another
4123406 as i crossed that foul line i kind of just laughed it off
4123407 one of those guys you dont ever want to see
4123408 we have to come out of training camp with energy
4123409 we need to hit some people in the mouth i dont think we hit enough people in the mouth last year
4123410 the approach is based on who we think is going to be able to lead the team and do the best job
4123411 omar wants to see you in his room when you get back to the hotel
4123412 we still feel a little bit of a sense of people saying that the patriots lost
4123413 but if we havent shut up a lot of doubters yet we can still shut them up next year
4123414 i think itll definitely be addressed when we get into training camp and get everybody together
4123415 last year is last year thats not going to help us win any games this year we cant talk about it youve got to get out there and do it that was our mantra last year talk is cheap play the game i think that carries over into next year as well you cant talk about it youve got to be about it
4123416 i think brett will be glad he played in new york i think it will be a positive as much as he wanted to be in green bay
4123417 in a way it tears at you were only human
4123418 im sure brett wants the best for green bay but green bay is looking after green bay brett has to look after brett
4123419 vegas explosion of superdeluxe hotels and casinos has lured high roller tourists and the international celebrity chefs who feed them
4123420 and as in any boomtown ambitious immigrants have brought exciting ethnic cuisines
4123421 and i think that there are a lot of women who have had multiple abortions
4123422 there was a lot of shame and guilt behind it im a writer and once i started to write more about my experiences i felt like i needed to come out to help other women
4123423 and i would hope that they would understand that it was really difficult it wasnt like oh wow i got pregnant and im going to go and have an abortion i just did not have a sense of who i was in the world too many people are quick to judge where that person is when they get pregnant
4123424 it varies on the scale between women saying i really understand
4123425 and then there are some who are just hideously turned off it runs the gamut on a scale from 1 to 10 i think i hit every number
4123426 i had a girlfriend who id known since we were 5 and she would not go with me
4123427 she just didnt feel comfortable doing it which really hurt my feelings shes very religious we grew up in the same catholic church
4123428 i dont know why i never thought i should take the pill or be careful i just never thought that anything would happen to me in both cases i was in a serious long term monogamous relationship
4123429 after that second one i got on the pill and ive been on it ever since
4123430 and i have no intention of going off of it until my husband and i decide to have kids
4123431 abortions performed in the first trimester pose virtually no long term risk of such problems as infertility ectopic pregnancy miscarriage or birth defect
4123432 was always on the lookout for cutting edge natural products
4123433 its got an icier texture than some of the other sorbet recipes because its made from fruit that has a naturally high water content its most appealing and quite refreshing on a hot summer day
4123434 we know from previous studies that most people retain about 50 percent of the weight they lose within six to twelve months
4123435 what we found in this study was that the women who kept off the weight did about 275 minutes of exercise a week
4123436 it doesnt really matter which form of exercise you do just pick one that burns calories
4123437 and it should be one that you enjoy so youll stick with it
4123438 i dont think it would change that much for men and in fact the excess body weight for men probably carries more health risks than it does for women
4123439 i think the forms of exercise men do are more rigorous and more sports related
4123440 i turn on my tv and do an hour of aerobics in the morning or i go on my recumbent bike
4123441 i get work done while i exercise i do a lot of reading in my job so i just read on my bike
4123442 my concern is that putting out a message like this can be overwhelming to the average person who has trouble exercising even two hours a week
4123443 plus the more you exercise the more you are prone to overuse injuries such as tendonitis and cartilage damage
4123444 strength training decreases the percentage of body fat improves metabolism and strengthens the muscles so you can improve your endurance to do aerobic exercise
4123445 for breakfast the omelets and the french toast are unbelievable the dinners you cant ask for anything better and its just a nice place to be
4123446 it has to be breakfast at the pelham bay diner
4123447 also people like that we never close we dont even have a key to lock the door
4123448 you waste so much time and so much effort just to figure out where things are
4123449 we want to achieve that balance as consistently as possible
4123450 that ive taken advantage of time and time and time again
4123451 if you dont see a moose the next tour is on us
4123452 and i often give meds in case they may come down with travelers diarrhea
4123453 you missed some makos and blues yesterday they were all over the cage
4123454 i grew up on the water and started diving when i was 12
4123455 as soon as we got older my friends started doing shark fishing but i wanted to be in the water
4123456 so a friend and i built a cage and i finally decided to add it to the wreck diving i was doing on the other boat
4123457 lots of things are being said regarding banning shark fishing and the effects of tournaments on the shark population i would say im neutral on the issue i just dont want to get involved in it i just want to show people that theyre more beautiful than scary
4123458 you are conditioning sharks to associate engine noise with a free meal
4123459 but the flip side of that coin is people immediately change their perception of sharks after a cage dive they work as ambassadors
4123460 i hadnt seen enough of it because i was only there to work
4123461 i would love to go back i studied pictures in books id like to see it again and other scandinavian nations at right icelands snaefellsjokull glacier asia
4123462 i thought that was very interesting there are those vacation spots that are hard to not say are lovely like tahiti thats why you go there its beautiful
4123463 i cant name a specific place but i look forward to the day when i can find somewhere thats nice and warm and clear and i can go scuba diving
4123464 thats when we really started to see that we were connecting
4123465 just about everything you need to orchestrate picture perfect nuptials can be found on line
4123466 where else can you compare 20 shops in 20 minutes
4123467 the key is to take any regular bridal checklist and tailor it to your needs
4123468 ive never seen a product that takes longer than six months to ship
4123469 aside from brown and black which typically arent too popular anyway the single most difficult flower color to find is blue
4123470 the best blue blooms are lush hydrangeas dramatic delphiniums and delicate tweedia but you will not find blue roses tulips peonies or orchids so if your color story involves blue consider using gorgeous green flowers and foliage like viburnum hypericum berries or ladys mantle or adding another more common color such as white for a soft look or bright orange for a more vibrant feeling
4123471 its difficult to get a real off white shade except with some callas some mums a few rose varieties and a couple strains of orchids
4123472 right away i knew i was in trouble because he was so cute i remember it was a full moon and we talked and hung out and he told me that night he was going to marry me and i just laughed
4123473 we went to the museum of natural history it was so funny because it was really hot in there and he had his coat on and the ring was inside so he wouldnt take it off
4123474 then we went for a walk through central park we sat by the little lake where they race the small boats and he gave me a card with a black and white photo of a boy and girl dressed up as a bride and groom and then he got down on his knee and proposed it was supersweet
4123475 mygallons is negotiating with multiple competing national payment networks and expects to have an announcement shortly
4123476 we went on a picnic and we sat there for ages just chatting away
4123477 then he just tapped me on the knee and i looked and there he was with a ring and he asked me to marry him
4123478 so i had a second wedding on june 21 in westchester so i could celebrate with my cousins and uncles who couldnt afford to come to england for the first wedding it was the practical thing to do
4123479 it was a less stressful option to have a second traditional wedding this way everybodys happy
4123480 there is definitely a rise in the number of couples having two weddings
4123481 its particularly popular with couples who elope the first wedding is usually an intimate affair with immediate family and a best friend and for the second wedding you can open it up to extended family co workers and additional friends
4123482 we wanted our big day to be special and intimate so were going to
4123483 later we thought it would be great to get our friends and family involved so now were planning a church ceremony and reception in the winter now i have the best of both worlds an exotic beach wedding and a traditional church wedding
4123484 or rent a private home with five or six bedrooms in an exotic location like caribbean these homes usually come with a cook and a staff and everyone can chip in
4123485 a small fortune can be saved by shopping sample sales for wedding gowns or by reusing flowers appoint someone to move the flowers from the ceremony to the reception
4123486 network with other brides and cut a deal with them on their gently used centerpieces or chair covers
4123487 if youre not getting enough sleep you dont feel as good and so much about feeling sexy and romantic has to do with how you feel about yourself
4123488 when he reached me he proposed and the other people in the parade turned and saluted and fire sirens went off he totally caught me off guard
4123489 many vendors pay to be on lists so they arent necessarily the best or most accurate referral sources
4123490 but its a good place to start your research and the best names will pop up again and again on the lists and when you call for referrals
4123491 dont think of destination vendors any differently than you would a vendor in your home town
4123492 most work is done via e mail phone and fax regardless of location so dont let that scare you you can ask them the exact same questions you would with any vendor
4123493 we would come across each other all the time and i just wouldnt give him the time of day
4123494 one night i had a dream about him and when i woke up i asked myself why dont i give this guy a chance
4123495 after all your grandmother dad and brother dont really care if you wear a white bubble dress or one with a 10 foot train
4123496 what they do care about is that youre honoring the meaning of the day and that includes the role they played in getting you to this point so while ample cleavage and legs for miles may be you calling card at cocktail parties your wedding is not the time to showcase them
4123497 there is no place that is going to ask you to look risqu
4123498 of course you want to be respectful of yourself and wear something in which you feel like yourself
4123499 but you also want to be respectful of everyone elses feelings especially your loved ones a hot pink gown might make your mom uncomfortable you have to decide if thats really worth it to you in the end
4123500 i tell my clients i am going to shoot it like a photo essay they see every photo i have taken
4123501 the stories of things going right and things going wrong
4123502 i had one wedding where the people took their little pug dog and put him in a tight dog tuxedo to carry the rings in a little basket down the aisle on a hot beach
4123503 and halfway down the aisle he collapsed but he was fine just overheated
4123504 i have one very funny groom in the car and he is rolling up the window as his mother was trying to squeeze in and give him a final kiss
4123505 shes standing next to the bride and she is just looking at the wedding dress in such a critical manner i have a little blast when i look at that one again
4123506 one time i saw a groom get drunk and make out with the maid of honor on the scaffolding across the street from the metropolitan museum leaving the bride at the table crying
4123507 believe it or not ive had a groom try to kiss me
4123508 i wanted a small wedding because at 30 years ive been to many weddings and rarely does one stand out in my head as being better than the next
4123509 weddings have become so routine and large and seemingly stressful for the couple getting hitched i wanted to avoid this something different and small with just the people i love the ones who really are enjoying being witness
4123510 two dozen people or so standing around you in a circle certainly creates a real feeling of intimacy
4123511 and a party with less than 50 people probably wont have a 10 piece band so people can truly talk instead of yelling at each other across the table all night long
4123512 something new wedding etiquette for rule breakers traditionalists and everyone in between
4123513 remember those wise old words an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure
4123514 if youve got great ideas that you want to keep reserved for your own wedding mums the word
4123515 the same influences are operating on the entire populace and can easily inspire similar ideas and interests
4123516 its almost a compliment at that point because youve already done your thing and now others are validating your sense of style by imitating it
4123517 it comes with the territory when you are truly a style leader
4123518 obviously theres a lot of belt tightening going on and many car buyers are holding off on a purchase they expected to make this summer
4123519 theyre pushing it off until winter or next year so manufacturers are cutting or slashing production but they still have a pretty hefty supply of vehicles on hand
4123520 the cars were not for sale but simply being hidden
4123521 its anything fuel and space efficient as well as hybrids
4123522 its pretty clear based on increasing cost of fuel that people are looking for more economical cars to drive and theyre getting out of suvs and crossovers
4123523 the whole midsize and large sedans market is going to get more competitive one thing thats happening is that residual value on sedans is holding steady and residual value isnt as good on suvs and crossovers
4123524 this is the first time brokers are joining together across company lines in a program
4123525 we compete with each other all day every day but planning raising money and building together for this effort has been extraordinary
4123526 ive sold condos in trump plaza while in hard hats but ive never done anything quite like this it gives you a real appreciation for a trade that requires a lot of experience and practice

4123532 thats whats lacking today everything is so cookie cutter i build things
4123533 its my job to affect the process for the betterment of the people who live here shop here and own businesses here
4123534 i picture myself part of the community here there is a vibrant commercial and residential history we want to keep ground floor retail and ensure nothing can be built that will take away from the symmetry of these historic buildings the magic here is in the density of people using these streets and living together
4123535 i came to be close to the artists who live and create here
4123536 youd open the front door and theyd say peter come on out back then things were different we always kept a white picket fence you always had the flag pole with the flag and you always in the backyard had the peach tree

4123541 it was just awful without him weve had him since he was a puppy and hes one of the family

4123546 im very sorry for the actions that bring me before you
4123547 i brought shame upon myself my family and the profession i tried to make amends by cooperating and accepting responsibility and seeking treatment for my addiction
4123548 i only ask your honor to restore my life and allow me to take care of my family
4123549 the nba the players and the fans relied upon him to perform his job in an honest nonconflicted manner and not one compromised by a financial interest in the games he was officiating
4123550 i cant think of any greater penalty than for a son to tell his father jerry an accomplished college basketball referee what hed done
4123551 mr lauro has repeatedly overstated and at times flatout exaggerated the value of mr donaghys cooperation
4123552 hopefully the healing process can begin in earnest for all
4123553 i think the fans in this country are interested that the true story will come out
4123554 realtytrac now has more than three quarters of a million properties in its active lender owned database a number that represents about 17 percent of the inventory of existing homes for sale reported in june by the national association of realtors
4123555 nominal home price declines have stabilized in the 10 to 11 percent range for several months

4123561 es una buena inyecci n en estos momentos todos aqu estamos concientes que los cachorros y los cerveceros tienen mejores equipos que nosotros pero estamos en la pelea y carpenter nos va a ayudar a darle alcance en esta recta final
4123562 claro que si estoy contento con la organizaci n contento con el trabajo de sojo y con el que realizamos todos como equipo creo que realmente la pr xima temporada nos sacaremos esa espinita
4123563 por mala suerte no pude estar en el primer cl sico pero estoy dispuesto a representar a mi pa s si me llaman ah estar para venezuela
4123564 son decisiones que se escapan del pelotero si fue el sr luis sojo el seleccionado debe haber una raz n en lo personal contento por el nombramiento y espero que en el pr ximo cl sico se haga un mejor papel que en el anterior
4123565 gambling is a way to medicate oneself from the stress and pressures of everyday life
4123566 the amounts of money mr donaghy wagered progressed as evidenced by his eventually playing golf for up to 500 per hole the amounts he bet on sports also increased
4123567 donaghys pattern of betting activity indicates he could curtail at will his illegal behavior
4123568 renaldo really had no role after we drafted gallinari and with the emergence of wilson chandler his minutes would be nonexistent
4123569 so it really wasnt fair to him to keep him in a spot that he wouldnt play and also gives us an opportunity to clear up a roster spot and move on
4123570 a carteira de opera es de cr dito registrou crescimento de 9 2 neste trimestre impulsionada principalmente pelo cr dito s pessoas f sicas
4123571 ping pong monopoly it didnt matter we always competed and always enjoyed the competition
4123572 you lose a quarter to her it was like blood
4123573 you didnt play monopoly just to keep score theyd be on the refrigerator for everyone to see
4123574 we knew who won the most risk games that year who had the highest score on the pinball machine in the basement we had records for everything that was the type of life we lived
4123575 if you cant take it any better than that just quit
4123576 if he wakes up today and feels great hell play
4123577 he makes the biggest contract and hes one of the oldest players on the team
4123578 that doesnt really fit into a rebuilding plan just to be honest
4123579 id try to trade him or buy him out at this point
4123580 i just think he needs a fresh start somewhere else marbury needs to be on a veteran team where he fits into what theyre trying to do a little bit more
4123581 i thought we needed someone whos a true point guard someone who can facilitate and defend
4123582 are the knicks one of the best teams in the league no not at all
4123583 but the opportunity to be part of a change is also great and something im looking forward to people dont realize when i went to the bulls we were kind of in the same situation and we were able to turn that around
4123584 i havent been a starter consistently in my whole career of course i think thats every players aspiration to be a starter to be a healthy contributor but whatever the role is i need to play ill execute it every night and if i cant execute it it wont be because of lack of effort
4123585 we were trying to redefine our team first starting with high character people and second highly competitive people third is what we call high energy people
4123586 i think keyon qualifies under all of those characteristics hes a live wire
4123587 whatever we do in free agency has no bearing on the rest of our roster
4123588 were still in the process of evaluating the entire team
4123589 i dont have anyone here in new york who is my confidant my wife isnt here im by myself
4123590 we had a numbers problem obviously and that led to this latest transaction
4123591 i think the track record of the two players is such that they can certainly help us in areas that we need to get better in
4123592 i feel better about this team going forward than i did a month ago
4123593 weve gotten bigger weve gotten younger and weve gotten stronger over the past six months weve lost a great player in jason and a heck of a player in richard so well have to see but long term i feel better about our team
4123594 when ratner says late in the year he means late in 2010
4123595 we still might make a trade or two there are some free agents were looking at so this is not going to be our final roster
4123596 i am not going to the convention i have made this clear
4123597 nu este normal sa existe un tratament diferit intre un fost si actual ministru
4123598 trebuie sa uniformizam statutul demnitarilor din statul roman fosti ministri actuali ministri presedintele romaniei parlamentarii cu totii trebuie sa fim pe aceeasi linie cu un cetatean obisnuit este clar ca in acest moment este vorba despre credibilitatea clasei politice romanesti
4123599 cu ce este mai breaz un actual ministru nu cumva faptul ca doar fostii ministri se afla in aceasta situatie este o invitatie pentru actuala putere sa prigoneasca fosta putere care se afla in opozitie vine psd peste doua luni de zile si incepe sa i fugareasca pe ceilalti unde ajungem vom avea aceasta circoteca la nesfirsit
4123600 the bottom line line when i started this interview process was to find a coach that fit into the plan that we have
4123601 i wanted a coach who demanded accountability was a strong communicator and someone who can inspire a team those are all ingredients that we feel scott has
4123602 obviously there were philosophical differences in how we perceived that this organization should go forward
4123603 my strong belief never subsided since the end of last season that the philosophical divide was too much to bear
4123604 it has been a difficult decision for me because of owner charles wangs decision to give ted the opportunity to coach again in the nhl
4123605 i understand there could be some criticism for waiting and if there is it falls on me
4123606 there have been philosophical differences and weve agreed its a good time for me to move on
4123607 i want to thank the islanders organization for giving me a chance to coach in the nhl again i have tremendous respect for what the team is trying to do and i wish them well
4123608 mark was someone we targeted from the beginning and were thrilled hes an islander
4123609 mark provides us with the stability on the blueline that we were looking for
4123610 obviously im disappointed about certain people but i cant dwell on that
4123611 as a coach youve got to consider both sides of the street and when you give your input you have to be fair certainly its an exciting time for the rangers
4123612 jaromir is just a great player and i was privileged to coach him
4123613 im disappointed that he wont be back and to suggest otherwise wouldnt be telling the truth im disappointed hes not still here
4123614 but theres a business component to this and im not privy to all the discussions between glen sather and his agent we tried to get a center here that we believed would have excited him and whom he would have had success playing with
4123615 i have a lot of time for the man hes a good soul
4123616 i always use this analogy if i could choose who my neighbors would be living in a cul de sac jaromir jagr would be one of them
4123617 we just think the way the game is going with the way the defensemen have to be able to think and move the puck with this guy it just gets on his stick and its gone
4123618 hes already got the guy figured out where hes passing it to and thats the kind of guy we were looking for
4123619 i can tell you that when coaches have these guys in junior they want to win games and they just tell them to go and keep them going
4123620 we get all caught up in the skating you need hockey sense to play this game and this guy has tremendous hockey sense you can have speed but if you cant move the puck out of your zone in todays game with guys bearing down on you when you cannot interfere with them this guy has it out under and over a stick so quickly its scary
4123621 i was pretty shocked for a bit when they started moving down and i thought i might have a shot to go there
4123622 we kept trading down because we believed we would be able to grab josh at no 9 while also stocking up on picks later in the draft
4123623 hes a center who makes other players around him better the type of center we need in our system
4123624 i think im the happiest 22 year old guy on the planet
4123625 i want to win everything so next year maybe the stanley cup
4123626 next year i think we will be much better and i cant wait to see it start
4123627 we love what were doing we never give up we believe in each other we believe in the coach we believe in everybody
4123628 only when you believe do you win the stanley cup
4123629 sixty five goals leading scorer in the league and their team made the playoffs
4123630 they turned it around pretty amazingly and everyone knows what a huge part of that he was
4123631 hes very deserving it was fun to watch him too
4123632 in between debating whether i want to go to grad school or get a job i figured id come out here and show them what i have
4123633 fred comes from wilmington which is not a real basketball hotbed but he actually displayed he had the ability to play with guys on a division i level
4123634 he knows the game well and hes not a selfish player
4123635 he strives to get others involved but its not easy to sign point guards overseas because of the restriction on american players its not a question of how good he is its a question of finding the right team
4123636 it gave guys who normally wouldnt have one an opportunity to showcase their talent
4123637 thats what european teams look for in american players they want them to take most of the shots by the fall hell be in europe
4123638 but after 58 years i think i got a right to be a little selfish
4123639 let me spell it i d o n t how many times can i say it im having fun im enjoying it thats the way its going to go we can lose 10 games by 15 points and i might say hey were that close were one play away ill know if i dont feel like im doing a good job ill know id like to retire when i feel as if i cannot make a contribution to penn state
4123640 i worked at the american radiated cemetery corporation of new york city in the summers in high school over on 45th st just two blocks from the new york public library
4123641 every lunchtime i was in there they have a tremendous reading room my wife turned down an english fellowship at brown to marry me
4123642 i met author doris kearns goodwin in washington recently shes from brooklyn and used to be a big dodgers fan shes a big yankees fan and she had just written a great book called a team of rivals about lincoln and the jealousy in his cabinet its a fascinating book for anyone who has to manage people
4123643 i cant express how important he has been not only to cbs sports and its coverage of college basketball but also to the growth of this great sport
4123644 their cbs executives timing to announce it now is their business
4123645 i had nothing to do with that i did say there would be no mention during the season
4123646 the integrity of the sport is more important than any promotion for television
4123647 i hope every team takes us a little bit for granted
4123648 im speechless about their effort im speechless about their concentration and their will to win this game
4123649 we had everybody finishing their checks moving their feet better i think that was the difference
4123650 we just came out flat we were a little sloppy there is no excuse for it we shouldve been ready for this game and we werent
4123651 its a lot nicer that we dont have to think about this game too long before our next big game comes up were going to learn from this mistake and hopefully well be ready for a big game tuesday
4123652 the way this cba will work is if you have affordable good young players its smarter to wrap them up longer term than it is to go into the market and then sign marquee free agents to take their place
4123653 every team has got insurance so its not like the owners are going to be paying it out if the guy gets injured
4123654 rick has stood up to his end of the deal hes playing really well for them every year
4123655 tonight i was the guy you play 400 some games and get three points for the first time
4123656 we know that to win in the playoffs everybody has to chip in
4123657 my timings still not there but as far as the ankle goes it feels ok
4123658 we killed a lot of penalties and things tonight so it was hard to get into a rhythm while we were out there
4123659 they get a guy like crosby back and hossa comes back theyre a pretty explosive team
4123660 i got lucky because i lost the puck so i just chipped it in
4123661 i didnt even mean to do that and it went in so i guess its a good thing i lost it because i would have made a move and he probably would have stopped it
4123662 the puck bounces over his blade and runs flat so he panics and just puts it on net but because he tried to pull it i made a move and he caught me in my move
4123663 its frustrating because our line made too many mistakes tonight
4123664 its frustrating because we are down 3 1 now and there are no more tomorrows for us we have to win now
4123665 i had time i had the puck on my stick
4123666 it was the second time it happened this series we had a bad mistake at a bad time our line we made too many mistakes tonight yes we scored goals but we didnt get it done defensively
4123667 it is really hard but you start by winning the first game you have to really pay attention to what you are doing at the moment
4123668 when you consider what happened two years ago i think the devils were kind of able to flex their playoff muscle and experience and though those two teams were probably evenly matched in the regular season the devils showed they were a bit more playoff ready
4123669 and what this organization has done since then speaks volumes for how we won this series
4123670 theyre doing a very good job there in brodeurs crease theyre making it hard for him
4123671 i think we need to take the positive of what theyre doing there and incorporate it in our game
4123672 i just stuck my stick between his legs and gave her a little push
4123673 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4123674 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4123675 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4123676 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4123677 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4123678 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4123679 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4123680 saya sering membuat kesalahan seperti ragu ragu dalam menempatkan bola sehingga bolanya nanggung dan mudah di smes

4123682 i havent talked to johnson for a long time maybe since january i think i was more upset that something like that was seen on mothers day as the oldest son you dont want to bring that on your mother on mothers day i was totally overwhelmed and didnt understand what was going on
4123683 i was actually a little nervous there must have been 6 000 people there just trying to get a look
4123684 write it down underdog does not mean anything we showed anything can happen
4123685 theyre a true champion and they did it the hard way
4123686 and i guess thats what you have to do to win a national championship
4123687 it goes to show you dont need that first round draft pick on your team to win that national championship
4123688 you need 25 guys we were all committed to the team no one was about himself
4123689 signature collector davison testified before the state board of elections that he got paid by the page
4123690 it appears to us that he was just trying to make more money
4123691 i had to be in springfield so i could not be in lake county coordinating things
4123692 we paid people who were generally unemployed and were trying to help people out
4123693 these are not the kenneth davison and jerry knight that i knew
4123694 we showed what we havent shown this season we showed some character
4123695 this place has a different aura than yankee or shea stadium
4123696 maybe thats because its a fairly new ballpark and a nice ballpark to hit in
4123697 they were down to earth guys and they treated me like an equal
4123698 i think hell be fine he knows that nothing will be given to him
4123699 but if youre a good athlete youll make the adjustment
4123700 i dont know what other jurisdictions are going to go like california
4123701 i dont know if were going to want to send a horse to california to run weve got to be in a situation where we can go anywhere we want to were ready to go send the plane
4123702 anybody in racing over the last years had to use a certain amount of it because you had to stay competitive
4123703 your owners want to receive enough purses to stay in the game if youre not competitive and dont win on a regular basis they take your clubhouse box away from you
4123704 the horsemen have accepted change without resistance there have been no marches on
4123705 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4123706 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4123707 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4123708 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4123709 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4123710 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4123711 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4123716 blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly nor stands in the path of sinners nor sits in the seat of the scornful 2 but his delight is in the law of the lord and in his law he meditates day and night
4123717 in the past god spoke to our ancestors at many different times and in many different ways through the prophets 2 in these last days he has spoken to us through his son god made his son responsible for everything his son is the one through whom god made the universe 3 his son is the reflection of gods glory and the exact likeness of gods being he holds everything together through his powerful words after he had cleansed people from their sins he received the highest position the one next to the father in heaven
4123718 that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked at and our hands have touched this we proclaim concerning the word of life 2 the life appeared we have seen it and testify to it and we proclaim to you the eternal life which was with the father and has appeared to us 3 we proclaim to you what we have seen and heard so that you also may have fellowship with us and our fellowship is with the father and with his son jesus christ 4 we write this to make our joy complete 5 this is the message we have heard from him and declare to you god is light in him there is no darkness at all

4123741 i can think of a dozen male athletes who have the potential of michael
4123742 but michael has been focusing and developing this for 10 years he has been guided through a tremendous physiological program he has tremendous endurance the ability to perform over a long period of time he has tremendously efficient strokes couple that with a great competitive psyche and the support group of the people around him its just a tremendous combination

4123748 i didnt know about him before the olympics but i definitely know about him now
4123749 the taliban uses innocent civilians homes taking them by force to attack afghan and coalition forces
4123750 were accustomed to housemates making a bid for freedom but most of time they manage to make it out of the door
4123751 big brother comforted rachel and instructed her to bring the other fish to the diary room too hopefully it wasnt off to join its sole mate just yet for the record no fish were harmed in the making of this story
4123752 all necessary instruction had been passed on to ensure the health and continued well being of the goldfish
4123753 i can almost guarantee you that voter turnout will be the largest in keenes history because of this issue
4123754 they presented us the required number of signatures by registered voters
4123755 we had one small area that was four feet by 10 feet of wet insulation
4123756 all great change in america begins at the dinner table
4123757 if hillary shoots her way onto the ticket new york gov paterson will be under pressure to replace her with caroline
4123758 all i know is shes being much more proactive than expected
4123759 shes taking it very seriously and trying to engage as much as she can she doesnt want to be window dressing and she doesnt want to be exploited
4123760 there is a high level of privacy that is extended to her
4123761 nobody discusses caroline kennedy it just isnt done it isnt allowed
4123762 a caller identified herself as having driven a woman who adopted gabby to the spca she promised to contact the woman about giving back the dog
4123763 but in this situation the only thing i can do is be held accountable and express sincere condolences
4123764 i cant explain it my wife was a wonderful person and didnt deserve this i fell for a coed it was stupid but i was a willing participant i really thought i would get off like a lot of people who are deluded
4123765 im glad we got caught so no one else would get hurt
4123766 hes able to at least make one decision on his own
4123767 no one could be a bigger more condescending prick who abuses the power of his office than bill thomas
4123768 we hope that the suspicion that fascism is being reborn in a different form proves to be untrue
4123769 the positions it takes are exclusively the responsibility of its editors
4123770 we have no prejudice against the berlusconi government we took the same line during the previous centre left government of romano prodi
4123771 it is the right of citizens to judge the government any government in a free debate
4123772 the cbcps opinion even in the past is to have a constitutional convention whose members are elected by the people secondly should there be a charter change then it should be done after 2010 the new administration should handle it
4123773 if there is no consultation no communal discernment before acting the problem will get worse there is also the possibility that the solution is the wrong solution
4123774 this covert accord has been uncovered more so the certain provisions that are not only untenable but also unbelievable if the philippine constitution would not be changed
4123775 but more than just accommodating the said secretive consensus there is something much more deviate and sinister in the cha cha charter change about which malaca ang has been long since salivating in other words any constitutional change done in any way and anyhow before may 2010 is primarily geared at extending the reign of the present national leadership
4123776 may be a way to keep president arroyo in power beyond 2010 because once you begin changing the constitution anything can happen
4123777 the need for consensus is as important as for the grp it is wisdom to consult ask questions and secure assistance regarding directions and goals from stakeholders for the government consult with the different branches of government and with the people directly affected by conflict
4123778 we have to clear first many things it seems that the moa ad has many complexities it fails to reach proper consultations the language used in the agreement is vague and it was done in haste
4123779 i advocate federalism as a way to gain lasting peace in mindanao
4123780 this concentration of such enormous powers in manila has created only one center of finance and development in the country resulting in a highly centralized system of government
4123781 is the absence or utter lack of consultation of stakeholders including christian leaders indigenous peoples in mindanao and peace advocates themselves
4123782 contravenes the very essence of any peace process which is participative of the stakeholders
4123783 there is nothing in the track record of this government that says it can be trusted with amending the constitution
4123784 nothing it can be proposed in the committee in the plenary
4123785 we must disassociate the principle of federalism from any rumors of term extension for the president

4123797 we want to see more balance where everyone has a good chance of winning rather than just being an also ran
4123798 trying to get any sport into where its not known at all where theres no interest isnt easy
4123799 its easy when you to go a country and say hey were an olympic sport right away you get instant credibility
4123800 the problem we face now is that were not an olympic sport but we want to be again
4123801 if we can get kids interested at a young age we have a better opportunity to see our sport develop
4123802 a lot of people dont understand now to play it
4123803 we need to get more kids involved in the sport our numbers have definitely dropped
4123804 kids are just not playing as many sports as they used to
4123805 outside of the united states its very difficult anywhere you go but thats kind of part of growing the sport

4123808 id lost to him eight nine 10 50 times i dont know how many but i had the feeling it could be my day today
4123809 he didnt play a good first game and that put me up straight away i played loose and free and i always fancy my chances on the 5 4 game
4123810 when he got that net cord i started wondering if it would turn around and he would come back playing like the best player in the world but i know i can beat the best in the world on my day and today i proved it
4123811 im going off as a freshman in a very competitive academic school and well see where that takes me im not going to say anything definite now
4123812 maybe ill gain 15 pounds and become a normal college student
4123813 dont settle for the one you can live with settle for the one you cant live without

4123852 it is important that drivers concentrate at all times and anything which is a distraction will be taken into account by the courts
4123853 you will still be able to eat your sweets but you will not be able to take your eyes off the road to unwrap them
4123854 careless drivers put themselves and others at risk every time they get behind the wheel of a car
4123855 the introduction of this legislation will hit home the message that driving is a hazardous activity that requires total concentration allowing distractions to affect your standard of driving is not acceptable
4123856 this will make it clear to drivers that they must concentrate at all times because if they kill someone a jail term is almost inevitable
4123857 while we welcome the fact that more drivers who commit offences and kill will hopefully now be imprisoned the law is still woefully lenient to tackle drivers who kill and maim through their own actions with catastrophic consequences for families
4123858 anything that rises in value is going to be an attraction to the light fingered

4123869 to have a piece of his gold medal with you and with every person on our team is just inspirational
4123870 when we heard him talk at our breakfast after the trials it was awe inspiring he just made you feel like you were part of it with him even though it was so long ago
4123871 it was the last connection to that moment it just connected the team loved it
4123872 to get that from him hes such an idol in canadians swimming
4123873 i think it really means a lot to the whole team and it brought us together
4123874 i couldnt believe he did that cutting up the towel
4123875 everyone was really surprised when he did that it was fantastic
4123876 its moved around the world with me out of all the stuff i had somehow this damn old towel just kept coming with me
4123877 it giving it to the swim team seemed like the right thing to do it was a symbolic thing i wished it had turned into a medal
4123878 if i want to remember the moment i have this beautiful gold thing

4123880 el cuerpo del deseo is most watched soap opera nationwide
4123881 hes probably had one of the best tournaments anyone has ever had in the domestic one day game but unless youre banging out 2 000 runs in the championship one day cricket always gets overlooked a little bit
4123882 hes very hungry about scoring runs hes at a stage where hes not going to play for his country hes just got county cricket and hes very very driven
4123883 hes getting towards the latter years of his career but i think hes got a few of them left and hes got an immense appetite for runs and for improving
4123884 every year hes come back to us hes come back a better player
4123885 there are too many players in county cricket when they cant play for england any more theyre just happy to cruise through wheras van jaarsveld every year makes a little change here and there and becomes a better player and its a credit to him
4123886 weve played a lot against essex this might be our sixth game against them in one day cricket this year so each side knows a lot about the other
4123887 theyve got some dangerous players who can ruin your day just as we have
4123888 ravi bopara and our joe denly are probably the best two young players in the country and graham napier is obviously on the crest of a wave at the moment
4123889 ill probably have a better idea after the match because kent are probably the best people to ask about whats the better day this final or twenty20 finals day
4123890 twenty20 is a fantastic day and evening out for the punters and the for the players its non stop
4123891 for atmosphere the rose bowl and edgbaston the year before is going to be hard to beat
4123892 as far as playing at lords in a final every time you play there its an event even in front of one man and his dog

4123898 core has successfully leveraged kodiak systems expertise with hosted exchange for the java based workflow mailers in the e business suite configurations
4123899 the successful partnership between core and kodiak has enabled clients to realize the benefits of the seamless integration of the ebs and exchange products to communicate alerts and notifications for its clients users and suppliers

4123911 you muslims prepare for war and raise the banner of jihad let us shed our blood let our limbs be dismembered until we regain the wise caliphate rule
4123912 i think this is an argument the coup leaders are making to justify themselves and what they did but it doesnt conform to reality
4123913 we came to an idea to do something special that will be only ours

4124024 the implications of the refugee crisis that is the result of our ill conceived iraq misadventure should not be understated
4124025 the displacement of millions both internally and to neighboring nations only increases the potential for regional volatility and radicalization
4124026 if the refugees do not receive sufficient support from the host governments and the international community
4124027 there is a very real danger that political actors will seek to fill the gap as they reportedly now do inside iraq it is important to remember that both hezbollah and hamas derive much of their popular legitimacy from the fact that they created effective social support systems to help needy people when governments were unable to do so

4124036 barry was previously quite religious in islam his birth father barack hussein obama was a muslim economist from kenya before marrying ann dunham hussein obama was married to a woman from kenya who had seven children all the relatives of barrys father were very devout muslims
4124037 we previously often asked him to the prayer room close to the house
4124038 all indonesian students are required to study religion at school and a young barry soetoro being a muslim would have been required to study islam daily in school he would have been taught to read and write arabic to recite his prayers properly to read and recite from the quran and to study the laws of islam
4124039 in the muslim school the teacher wrote to tell mother i made faces during quranic studies
4124040 at that time i was not barrys teacher but he is still in my memory

4124055 i think its very clear that russian ambitions are to restore the old russian empire
4124056 you have to be clearheaded about that kind of regime
4124057 mccains been much more clear sighted than the bush administration or many of our allies in europe
4124058 this is a guy who grew up in the cold war was a military person and an honorable man but has not changed his ways of thinking about russia
4124059 explaining with precision what we dont like about their behavior rather than saying he looked into putins eyes and saw kgb that has an adolescent quality that gets us exactly nowhere
4124060 speaking directly to the russians as opposed to in some pugnacious cold war fashion is what this modern challenge needs
4124061 what russia needs to know is that it will be globally ostracized and barack obamas global approach is different from the state to state balance of power approach that is visible in the mccain talking points
4124062 he was a reaganite in the cold war that was a pro democracy anti communist approach
4124063 he was certainly supportive of yeltsin from the early 90s through the mid 90s
4124064 we should make clear to russia that we appreciate the importance of russian stability to our own security
4124065 but we should make equally clear to russia that we are free to pursue all opportunities for enhancing our security and that of our allies
4124066 w e must make abundantly clear to moscow that we consider this action to be evidence that russia cannot yet be trusted as good faith partners in preserving european stability
4124067 i suspect that john mccain was made privy to sensitive or classified info that we may have on putin his kgb past things hes done
4124068 when putin emerged as this highly capable strongman with kgb networks i suspect that turned mccain off
4124069 a country that increasingly appears to have more in common with its soviet and czarist predecessors than with the modern state vladimir putin claims to aspire to build
4124070 moscow must understand that it cannot enjoy a genuine partnership with the west so long as its actions at home and abroad conflict so fundamentally with the core values of the euro atlantic democracies

4124073 he would never tell us to do something contrary to his character
4124074 only the devil could tell someone those things god would never say that
4124075 would you ever let god talk to you that way would you even give him a moment of your time to listen perhaps consider his wisdom
4124076 as my servant isaiah has walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and a wonder concerning egypt and concerning kush so the king of ashur will lead away the captives of egypt and the exiles of kush young and old naked and barefoot and with buttocks uncovered to the shame of egypt
4124077 and lie on your left side and you shall put the crookedness of the house of yisra l on it as many days as you lie on it you shall bear their crookedness
4124078 for i myself have laid on you the years of their crookedness according to the number of the days three hundred and ninety days and you shall bear the crookedness of the house of yisra l
4124079 and when you have completed them you shall lie again on your right side and shall bear the crookedness of the house of yehud
4124080 and eat it as a barley cake and bake it before their eyes on human dung
4124081 how well do i know his character would i even consider letting him speak to me about anything even near what he asked these two

4124087 i am so spiritual i will go through the sun door and not participate in this darkness of the lunar cycle at all and you wont see me coming back
4124088 if god had only asked me i could have given him some pointers
4124089 sadly because i see so many christians who are not only powerless but they live in rampant fear i have concluded that this passage is not true it must be like one of the products offered on infomercials that dont really work
4124090 i dont believe that jesus dealt with sin at all simply because i see so much sin in the world
4124091 if god has dealt completely with sickness then no one would get sick
4124092 if god has dealt completely with sin then no one would sin

4124127 these challenges only further strengthen the need to look for alternative resolutions in handling disputes

4124131 one of the things we could look to do is to put sound in and get sound out which essentially means communicating theres no reason why we cant do that and i see that as something what it will mean to the neuron culture by putting audio in and getting different audio out is that it would allow us to whistle to it and teach it in some way to respond back
4124132 simply from the habit of doing things repetitively the neuron connections strengthen and allow the robot to be able to do it more accurately in terms of teaching the cells to do more that is part of the research can we get it to improve by applying different voltage and chemicals and things
4124133 we are doing that now applying chemicals to part of the brain structure so that it stops growing and the neurons will die off and then see if the actions the robot has been doing are taken over so its like looking at what happens in a stroke
4124134 can the brain learn to do things it used to do how can it learn to do the things it used to do the key thing is as we understand things a bit more is to put it into different positions or a particular situation and teach it so that we can see how the memory of what to do in that situation is constructed in the brain by the connection
4124135 thats the problem with conservatives they cant approach things without an intensely partisan mindset

4124137 this evidence greatly unsettles moral objections to the death penalty because it suggests that a refusal to impose that penalty condemns numerous innocent people to death
4124138 a serious commitment to the sanctity of human life may well compel rather than forbid capital punishment
4124139 recent evidence suggests that capital punishment may have a significant deterrent effect preventing as many as eighteen or more murders for each execution
4124140 to be sure 30 or 40 categorically innocent people have been released from death row

4124145 we will definitely be taking part it is disappointing its not happening in september october but pleasing it is taking place this year
4124146 im the only guy in town that does the speed limit
4124147 ive had my rav4 ev toyotas all electric 4x4 for the last four years
4124148 it was supposed to be a prototype for the next generation of cars but the problem is that the car needs charging every night and the most you can do in a day is 80 miles it is like being tethered
4124149 it is unfortunate that this type of imagery would rear its head during something that is supposed to be a time of world unity
4124150 ive seen them in cases from new york city to small towns whoever can afford to get the equipment and plant it on a car
4124151 and of course its easy to do you can sneak up on a car and plant it at any time
4124152 but i dont think thats something detectives would be too happy to put out there like that
4124153 they do have different techniques they like to use on suspects but they dont really want people to know
4124154 a police officer could do the same thing with his or her own eyes
4124155 it helps to cut down on the number of police officers who would have to be out tracking particular cars
4124156 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
4124157 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
4124158 lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in terms of voice yang peiyi is perfect each member of our team agreed
4124159 he told us there was a problem that we needed to fix it so we did
4124160 i dont know but i sure dont like those who ask that question
4124161 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
4124162 chen said was in fact seven year old yang peiyi who has a chubby face and uneven teeth
4124163 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
4124164 chen said was in fact seven year old yang peiyi who has a chubby face and uneven teeth
4124165 this was a last minute question a choice we had to make
4124166 our rehearsals had already been vetted several times they were all very strict when we had the dress rehearsals there were spectators from various divisions including above all a member of the politburo who gave us his verdict we had to make the swap
4124167 but in the end the director thought her image was not the most appropriate because she was a little too old regrettably we had to let her go
4124168 the child on the screen should be flawless in image in her internal feelings and in her expression in the matter of her voice yang peiyi was flawless in the unanimous opinion of all the members of the team
4124169 we have a responsibility to face the audience of the whole country and to be open with this explanation
4124170 we should all understand it like this it is a question of the national interest it is a question of the image of our national music our national culture
4124171 especially at the entrance of our national flag this is an extremely important an extremely serious matter
4124172 so we made the choice i think it is fair to both lin miaoke and yang peiyi after all we have a perfect voice a perfect image and a perfect show in our teams view all together
4124173 there were a number of candidates to sing that song and at the end of the day the artistic directors picked the best voice and the best performer
4124174 i dont see there is anything wrong with it if everybody concerned agrees
4124175 the counterfeit games designed to look good from every angle
4124176 bring some sanity and proportion back to both the opening ceremony and the games themselves
4124177 our president may have gone there just to watch the games the chinese leadership does not take that view
4124178 shows once again how political the sponsorship of the olympics is for the chinese
4124179 this is pretty unfair for the girl who was not picked to perform live
4124180 this girl has a great voice and they should recognize that she deserves to be seen she should definitely perform at the closing ceremonies
4124181 if your son is playing on a football team suddenly the coach may decide that hes not playing hes going to stay on the bench
4124182 the right information has to be given to the people
4124183 yang peiyi missed out on selection to appear at the ceremony because of her external appearance it was for the national interest
4124184 i think there were a number of candidates to sing that song and at the end of the day the artistic director picked the best voice and the best performer
4124185 i think maybe on this one some people would believe that maybe it was not appropriate but the others would have said its fantastic because the performance was great
4124186 you can have different opinions but sport is exactly the same
4124187 if your son is playing on a football team suddenly the coach may decide that hes not playing hes going to stay on the bench
4124188 i dont agree with the decision because they are kids and it may scar them for life
4124189 i think the girl with the voice should have a chance to perform at the closing ceremonies it would be a great chance for her to redeem herself to the world
4124190 chens original interview was posted on beijing radios web site sunday night by tuesday the link was shut down the chinese government routinely blocks sites that are politically sensitive or that could cause embarrassment to the countrys communist rulers lin declined to answer when asked if peiyi should be included in the closing ceremony except to say that he was not the director he said his daughter was not doing any rehearsals and that he presumed she would not be involved in the closing ceremony
4124191 according to reports lin miaoke the cute seven year old who sang the national anthem was actually miming
4124192 according to reports lin miaoke the cute seven year old who sang the national anthem was actually miming
4124193 the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression

4124197 utopian fantasy that gun control laws will somehow make neighborhoods safer
4124198 while promising to preserve our second amendment rights the party platform demonizes semiautomatic sport utility rifles and wants them banned calls for anti gun show legislation and proposes so called common sense gun laws
4124199 boiled down all it really means is that the democrats are still the party of gun control no matter how they try to re package the rhetoric
4124200 shamelessly telling american gun owners that they embrace the rights of millions of shooters hunters and gun collectors
4124201 as democrats descend on denver to nominate a candidate who is on record in opposition to sensible concealed carry laws we encourage gun owners across the country and especially in colorado to remind the party that the supreme court in june held that gun bans are unconstitutional
4124202 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
4124203 i was half asleep listening to my walkman at the front of the bus when all of a sudden the van pulled in front of the bus and there was a major collision
4124204 the bus collided with the van and in turn moved off the road and hit a guard rail
4124205 there was another australian on the bus he acted very quickly to try and do what he could to manage the situation
4124206 we were able to get one of the passengers from the back of the van out onto the road but the others were certainly very seriously injured
4124207 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
4124208 the global models are good for investigating whats likely to happen on a planetary scale but the resolution is quite coarse when looking at a more localised regional scale
4124209 its a bit like enlarging a digital photograph until it becomes pixellated and all sorts of detail is blurred out
4124210 simulating the climate of the region is a challenge for climate models due in part to the high natural inter annual variability the topography of the region which includes multiple mountain ranges and inland seas and the presence of a slight cooling trend in recent decades despite the global trend being a warming

4124216 nobody knew how this mechanism worked before we described this protein
4124217 this protein directly affects photosynthesis and how plants create biomass stems leaves and stalks and oils
4124218 weve found that if the tgd4 protein is malfunctioning the plant then accumulates oil in its leaves
4124219 if the plant is storing oil in its leaves there could be more oil per plant which could make production of biofuels such as biodiesel more efficient more research is needed so we can completely understand the mechanism of operation

4124292 zu den aussagen von o gkk obmann alois st ger bez glich der ausgabensteigerungen bei medikamenten in den jahren 2007 und 2008 k nnen wir leider keine fundierten aussagen treffen die ober sterreichische gebietskrankenkasse hat ihre gebarung f r das letzte und das laufende jahr noch nicht offengelegt
4124293 es ist f r eine sachliche diskussion nicht f rderlich mit inoffiziellen bzw nicht nachvollziehbaren daten zu argumentieren
4124294 es ist absolut richtig dass die demografische entwicklung in sterreich einer der hauptfaktoren f r die steigenden ausgaben in der gesundheitsversorgung ist ich bin erfreut dass die krankenkassen diese tatsache mittlerweile akzeptiert haben
4124295 es ist eine errungenschaft unserer medizin und unserer gesellschaft dass wir immer lter werden und bis ins hohe alter ges nder bleiben dies sollte als wert und nicht als last anerkannt werden es ist weder sozial noch fair menschen die ihr ganzes leben gearbeitet und beitr ge in dieses system eingezahlt haben das gef hl zu geben sie seien schuld an der finanzmisere der krankenkassen
4124296 die fortschritte in der forschung lassen uns heute krankheiten behandeln die vor wenigen jahren noch nicht therapierbar waren medikamente werden immer effizienter lassen sich besser dosieren und leichter einnehmen mit dem begriff scheininnovation kann ich in diesem zusammenhang nichts anfangen ich wage zu behaupten dass jeder patient eine tablette der injektionsnadel oder gar einer operation vorzieht die gesundheitsversorgung ist ein dynamisches system das nicht nach starren faktoren berechnet werden kann das beweisen innovation und demografie es geht hier um menschen nicht um gleichungen wenn man beginnt entwicklungspotentiale nach konomischen faktoren zu begrenzen bedeutet das nichts anderes als rationierung

4124309 while the hypothetical example of participating countries barring black athletes from the olympic games would have rightly caused international outrage the committee continues to allow the participation of countries that do not allow women on their olympic teams

4124312 i just had to share something that came up today and it made me feel a bit sick to my stomach so heres the visual two paparazzi come up out of nowhere like usual and start throwing questions at me one of them being hey lindsay what do you have to say about people commenting on your sisters implants wow did you really just ask me that she is a 14 year old girl and you are a pedophile i am not judging people that do but i am just saying that its not something that my family finds necessary to do especially when youre not even fully developed yet it is hard enough being 14 years old and you have enough insecurities to begin with then add being in the public eye i just find it really disconcerting that people have to focus on the negative and that some people are sooooo bored with their own lives that they need to manifest lies to hurt another person

4124333 i think it is now immensely important to deploy these new observers so that we have a clear picture on the humanitarian situation and in order to prevent further deterioration of situation between the ethnic groups
4124334 the loss in value due to foreign exchange for the cyclone nargis international humanitarian aid during the last three months has been about usd 1 56 million
4124335 we are not getting the full value of dollars donated for emergency relief and donors are extremely worried and keen to see that this issue is resolved
4124336 we do have alternative ways for the international humanitarian community including international ngos to bring in dollars and to get the full dollar value of their assistance
4124337 it will then be up to the vendors to manage their dollar accounts
4124338 we treat the fec as equivalent to the us dollar and give customers the same amount but we deduct 10 per cent from the amount as tax
4124339 this mechanism would hopefully help us to address the bulk of the problem very quickly and we appreciate that the government has been willing to work with us on a solution
4124340 why would i spend 500 on a netbook when i could get a full notebook

4124344 remember when i told you a couple of months ago that your father had moved to spain
4124345 well the police told me that they well they found your father dead
4124346 the police found some things in his apartment that they felt i we should know about
4124347 remember when you were fourteen and your father and i told you that you were adopted but we still loved you
4124348 you said that because of the chemo you couldnt have a baby so you and dad decided to adopt
4124349 however it seems that neither of us were told the truth all these years
4124350 the police found a pink baby blanket a bunch of new articles and a forged birth certificate in a false bottom in one of your fathers drawers
4124351 the officer i spoke with told me the articles were of a kidnapping case over in north carolina about the same time we adopted you
4124352 it appears from what the officer told me that your father lied about where he got you from

4124373 this was proof of principle in patients who had failed the standard therapies and had few if any remaining options
4124374 these patients had been through experimental treatments so it is not like we got anybody who had standard of care left weichselbaum said

4124376 not all metastatic cancer is the same in some people more aggressive therapy can potentially be beneficial
4124377 most likely this will be used with the targeted therapies
4124378 its ridiculous that we are playing maybe 11 matches in seven days to be honest
4124379 mugabes party latest antics show that the regime is not sincere on the dialogue process
4124380 politically whites will be much more interested in issues like health care and pensions
4124381 at the same time the growing minority population hispanics especially will be concerned about more youthful issues like schools
4124382 what this population rise means to me is anywhere from 40 to 80 million more cars on the road 35 to 40 million more houses built
4124383 i will be very sad twitter is about to become far less useful to me hope negotiations are swift and we can get sms back soon

4124400 human culture as we have known it for the past 200 years is drawing to a close a revolution of civilization is upon us prepare
4124401 the most significant characteristic of modern civilization is the sacrifice of the future for the present and all the power of science has been prostituted to this purpose
4124402 nobody made a greater mistake than he who did nothing because he could only do a little
4124403 sooner or later everyone sits down to a banquet of consequences
4124404 means that georgias ports and airports will be taken under the control of the u s defense department
4124405 we have no need nor do we intend to take over any georgian air or seaport to deliver humanitarian aid we have no designs on taking control of any georgian facility

4124408 scheunemanns work as a lobbyist poses valid questions about mccains judgment in choosing someone who and whose firm are paid to promote the interests of other nations

4124421 ive achieved everything i can in boxing im 36 years old and i dont want to keep on fighting i love boxing and i love what the sport has given me but i want to retire undefeated
4124422 roy jones went through a bit of a tough time in his career but hes come back and had three great wins
4124423 i cant underestimate him i have to make sure im 100
4124424 ill never forgive myself if i lose my last fight having been undefeated for the last 17 years
4124425 before i injured my hand i was training for two or three weeks so ive only had a little bit of time off
4124426 although ive not been punching ive been jogging to keep my fitness levels up
4124427 theres not much of a difference between winning and loosing the fact that you put in your best what gives you satisfaction and the fact that i did give that so i am happy
4124428 the indian olympics association and sports authority have their role to play they have played their part i am sure they can give a lot more for the indian sports and i hope that this gold medal will inspire them to work harder as well so that not just one but we come back with maybe 15 medals
4124429 theres a huge difference the difference is that every other country has a serious olympic programme unfortunately we dont until and unless we have as serious olympics programme supporting athletes right form the beginning from the grass root level we will not make progress so we have to have a serious olympics programme

4124436 i am constantly blown away by a society that says that sex is bad but violence is just fine we have war on tv all day long but if someone slips a nipple it becomes a national crisis its so backwards i am the luckiest guy in the world i am married to the most beautiful loving caring and understanding woman i could ever hope for imagine never having to apologize for who you are i like to sample lots of new women and film it but i truly love my wife she allows me the freedom to be who i am and not have to lie to myself we have no jealousy in our relationship just kindness understanding and the truth thanks for supporting me baby i love you forever viva la revolution viva rockstarpimp com

4124445 although reprogramming is worth pursuing it is extremely high risk and may take years to perfect and may never work as well as nuclear transfer cloning which we know we can practice today
4124446 already proven routes to obtaining embryonic stem cells from excess ivf embryos or through the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer
4124447 should not be put on hold pending the outcomes of the more speculative methods
4124448 the largest source of funding for human embryonic stem cell research in the world
4124449 human embryonic stem cells clearly remain the gold standard for research into pluripotent cells
4124450 it will not for the foreseeable future be suitable for clinical studies in human because of safety concerns
4124451 the largest source of funding for pluripotent stem cell research in the world as well as other stem cell approaches
4124452 during the last 10 years georgia southern university has undergone the greatest growth in physical facilities in its history and in the quality of academic programs
4124453 as we turn our focus to the universitys second century you can feel the excitement on campus the state and the region with increased interest from across the country and around the world we are entering a true era of achievement at georgia southern university
4124454 senator obamas proposed tax cuts for the middle class are actually marginal rate hikes in disguise
4124455 could it be that the illinois state legislature wants to prevent businesses from using the best available tools to determine whether new employees are illegal aliens
4124456 people often wonder why its so difficult for the government to get a grip on illegal immigration
4124457 but interest groups often work to slow or stop our efforts through lawsuits or political pressure we need to decide as a nation if were going to be serious about solving this problem it is up to congress to enact legislation that will fix the problem comprehensively until then we shouldnt tie the hands of the men and women trying to enforce the law as it is
4124458 shrm believes in secured borders for our country and we believe in maintaining a legal workforce
4124459 we believe e verify is at least a step in the right direction there are some very good qualities to it but we also believe that it just simply does not go far enough
4124460 currently there is no way for an employer to verify that a person showing certain forms of identification are there person that they are claiming to be
4124461 the database has not yet proven to be 100 percent accurate i think the last percentage i saw was a 4 percent error rate which represents roughly 6 million people within the countrys working population so there are components wed like to see added to it especially before it becomes and permanent and mandatory tool
4124462 with neva we do away with the paper aspect of verifying employment
4124463 so we get further away from the possibility of being fooled by fake documents the other piece that is of interest is the biometrics piece of verification so that we can hopefully do away with the cases of stolen identity cases with that piece we can be much more sure that the person presenting himself is who he says he is
4124464 and as with any tool its only as good as how it is used and monitored my understanding however is that the swift plants were using e verify and it did not help in their situation again this is because the documents can be falsified and e verify relies on documents i cant say that it would have prevented what agriprocessors went through and their workforce being illegal but my experience based on swift is that it did not help them
4124465 at first sight it may seem absurd to take productive workers and keep them in jail at taxpayers expense
4124466 but the economics and politics of the matter are quite different from such rational assumptions
4124467 a law enforcement agency for the post 9 11 era to integrate enforcement authorities against criminal and terrorist activities including the fights against human trafficking and smuggling violent transnational gangs and sexual predators who prey on children
4124468 are in immigration in fy07 ice removed 276 912 illegal aliens
4124469 since fy06 ice has introduced an aggressive and effective campaign to enforce immigration law within the nations interior with a top level focus on criminal aliens fugitive aliens and those who pose a threat to the safety of the american public and the stability of american communities
4124470 yet as of oct 1 2007 the case backlog consisted of 594 756 ice fugitive aliens so again why focus on illegal workers who pose no threat elementary they are easy pickings true criminal and fugitive aliens have to picked up one at a time whereas raiding a slaughterhouse is like hitting a small jackpot it beefs up the numbers
4124471 in fy07 ice dramatically increased penalties against employers whose hiring processes violated the law securing fines and judgments of more than 30 million
4124472 these incarcerated aliens have been involved in dangerous criminal activity such as murder predatory sexual offenses narcotics trafficking alien smuggling and a host of other crimes
4124473 for those who say that we are only focusing on the illegal workers themselves i point out that last year we had over 90 employers or those in a supervisory chain who were convicted of crimes we have had one ceo or president of a company sent to jail for 10 years
4124474 we will continue to pursue employers i know these cases take a little bit longer there is a it is always more difficult to work up the chain i can tell you as an old organized crime prosecutor and as an old drug prosecutor you always start with the bottom ring first then you work your way up to the top ring
4124475 to develop an electronic information sharing and verification hub capability
4124476 add 1 000 additional detention beds staffing and associated costs required to meet the current demand generated by increase enforcement activities
4124477 a women who is abused by her husband is truly placed in a situation of double jeopardy regarding hiv infection in that his sexual behavior outside of the marriage makes it more likely he is infected with the virus and his abusive behavior inside the marriage leaves her with little control over sex or sexual protection
4124478 those clinicians working to prevent hiv infection among their female patients should consider violence from male partners as an important risk factor and ask about and attempt to intervene in such abuse to reduce this risk
4124479 more critically major national and global hiv prevention programs must include reducing mens ipv perpetration as a key target in the fight to stem the epidemic
4124480 this study should serve as a wake up call to us all if we as policymakers and practitioners are going to be truly successful in addressing the spread of hiv in india we must think of ways to address the all too widespread mistreatment of wives
4124481 intimate partner violence and hiv infection among married indian women

4124483 he said he had intended to pay the money back if he could but he never did he accepted what he did was wrong mr maxted has many convictions for dishonesty

4124524 our goal is to make discoveries that will ultimately allow us to intervene with the most effective early therapy before a mild traumatic brain injury results in a chronic problem
4124525 there is a high prevalence of mild traumatic brain injury in soldiers and the consortiums work is driven by that we believe the conclusions of our research also will benefit civilians including athletes who have suffered concussions
4124526 the award of this grant confirms the collaborative platform of mission connect is a powerful and pivotal force in research
4124527 uniting these premier scientists in this shared research effort will accelerate the pace of discovery and provide the courageous men and women in our military with the best possible medical care for the brain injuries they have sustained
4124528 this grant is a huge boost to research in traumatic brain injury and will allow investigators to work together through mission connect
4124529 for baylor college of medicine it will help fund 10 investigators in neurology neuroscience neurosurgery and pain management and physical rehabilitation
4124530 only through collaboration can we make great strides in restoring function for our young brave men and women in the armed forces

4124535 our ability to apply novel intervention strategies to nervous system trauma based on the cellular and molecular biology observations made over the years would suggest that we will be able to make an impact on the treatment modalities to be developed over the next five years
4124536 at utmb the neuroscience research community has a long tradition of excellence dedicated to the understanding of trauma to the nervous system we are very happy to be able to make a contribution to this joint texas effort in what is an exemplary example of translational efforts at utmb
4124537 the institutions that make up mission connect have a long history of working together successfully this significant grant is testament to the fact that our collaboration makes us more competitive for funding than any one of our schools would have been alone and more importantly it strengthens our ability to improve the lives of those affected by traumatic brain injury
4124538 the award is very forward thinking since in addition to clinicians it includes neuroscientists working to elucidate the very basic and fundamental causes of nervous system injury all the way down at the molecular and cellular level
4124539 at present we know very little about how brain injury disrupts the connections and communication among neurons the neuroscientists participating will fill this huge gap in our knowledge armed with this information and working together in a collaborative environment clinicians and neuroscientists stand a much better chance of designing new and innovative treatments for traumatic brain injury
4124540 congratulations to dr valadka and the team for receiving this very prestigious and competitive funding which will improve our knowledge of the complex mechanisms involved in traumatic brain injury the awarding of this grant validates our national stature in the neurosciences and will improve patient care and clinical outcomes for many patients
4124541 a model of innovative thinking and close collaboration between multiple institutions to understand and to advance the care of patients with mild traumatic brain injury
4124542 mild traumatic brain injury is a tremendous problem and there is an outstanding team in place ready to tackle it

4124563 a man caused trouble inside the temple then it spilled out onto the street
4124564 women were blocking his car and trying to push it over while he was still inside clinging to the steering wheel
4124565 women were shouting abuse at men and they were retaliating but i couldnt understand it because it was in their own language
4124566 i saw a crowd of mainly women and children stood on one side of the road and men on the other
4124567 they were fronting each other up and shouting abuse across the road the women were screaming were not going anywhere
4124568 it was really quite heated and there was a big scuffle of people that looked like it was going to turn nasty
4124569 there have been rows before that have spilled out onto the streets form the temple but never as big as this one
4124570 we are going to be equal to men and to make decisions equal to the men
4124571 this is the first year we have ever had women voting at the temple but now a lot of extra women have come down at the last moment after the end of the agreed time period for registration
4124572 a lot of time and effort has gone into this and its been done very fairly
4124573 the elections were delayed for a variety of reasons and we have been involved in trying to help both parties through the negotiations
4124574 there are allegations of malpractice on both sides and our issue is to ensure that it doesnt come to violence
4124575 there are 650 registered members at the temple and while this isnt an issue of the community against the police there are two factions of the community here who cant reconcile their differences

4124592 in the next ten years when advances in digital and online technology open up new avenues for contributions in the world china and hong kong will represent a very substantial percentage of the innovation that will take place
4124593 this is why were here in working closely with the best universities microsoft research asia brings together the very brightest people from across china and asia giving them the expertise ideas and resources only microsoft can offer so they can focus on the new generation of breakthroughs and discoveries
4124594 for a better future in asia microsoft research asia has worked closely with the top minds of academia to foster stronger knowledge based economies throughout the region
4124595 hand in hand with universities and institutions weve made significant strides in helping countries cultivate their next generations of business leaders innovators and entrepreneurs over the past 10 years we look forward to continuing that winning partnership in china
4124596 the lab has helped china embrace information technology through collaborative links and partnerships with academic institutions
4124597 and now after a decade of achievement and discovery together we are committed to china and its academic community more than ever not only in helping them adapt to the global trends of it and the digital age but to adopting it as their own
4124598 hong kong originally didnt really have much of an industry that handled computer science before so were very fortunate to have microsofts help especially with the joint labs
4124599 because of the joint labs hong kongs top schools are taking on the worlds most challenging research projects for a better tomorrow but more importantly these labs are bringing the best of minds together in an academic environment
4124600 since 1999 weve had 95 students from universities in hong kong who have had internships in our research group worldwide
4124601 in the us its a challenge to attract the smartest people to go to science instead they all want to go to wall street the world needs more scientists and researchers
4124602 microsoft research asia and chinese university of hong kong share a long history of collaboration innovation and unforgettable academic exchanges that have helped foster chinas brilliant minds of tomorrow
4124603 i hope we can continue working closely with microsoft in the next decade we look forward to this very valuable partnership not only for universities but for hong kong asia and the world as a whole
4124604 great people like to work with great people thats the magic of microsoft research
4124605 in china the excitement of youth in sciences is very high and its inspiring to see that researchers in academia play an essential role in expanding the boundaries of scientific knowledge and driving progress

4124620 a middle aged white man in a white shirt entered our building at 525 west capitol avenue with a gun

4124640 over the past three years we have consistently found the sequential trigger twice as safe as the more commonly used contact trip trigger
4124641 the contact trip trigger allows workers to rapidly fire the tool and more frequently results in injuries from accidental discharges double fires and ricocheting nails
4124642 there are more than 35 000 visits each year in the u s to emergency departments for injuries from nail guns
4124643 we found that carpenters with more training were better equipped to handle the tool and less prone to an injury
4124644 carpenters were best protected when they received both classroom training and hands on instruction unfortunately most residential carpenters including immigrant workers are less likely to get training compared to the union workers we studied
4124645 there are currently no regulations that require the sequential trigger be used or that define minimal training requirements even though data suggests there should be
4124646 the voluntary standard change only called for shipment of the sequential triggers rather than their use
4124647 sequential triggers are now shipped with nail guns but the contact trip trigger is still being shipped in the same box
4124648 this was in an area with heavy media coverage and communication of the safety hazards
4124649 additionally the differences in speed were affected more by the skill of the carpenter than the trigger being used
4124650 working towards the required use of the sequential trigger will be important in the prevention of injuries among carpenters
4124651 consumers can go to their local home improvement store and purchase the same tool carpenters are using but they may not have any training
4124652 consumers who are less likely to receive training in tool use need to be sure they ask for a tool with a sequential trigger and they should ask for instructions in safe use as well

4124661 it doesnt make sense to deconstruct a building just to do these things
4124662 were finding in our buildings theres just a certain level of efficiency improvement that can be made
4124663 a property owner cant flip a switch and make their building sustainable
4124664 although rate increases lend more credibility to the need to change or become more sustainable
4124665 the systems need to be upgraded its just a matter of time
4124666 weve educated those that are interested otherwise theres not so much to do unfortunately were just used to utility rates going up
4124667 at that point buildings that have elected not to upgrade will find themselves on a path to functional obsolescence
4124668 an owner of an existing property today has to take a serious look at how theyre budgeting capital dollars and how much should be allocated to energy and overall sustainability of their property

4124679 we feed them every couple of days a pink liquid with nutrients not too dissimilar to what the olympians might drink for energy it keeps the neurons alive and allows them to grow within twenty four hours they make connections within a week there is a brain like activity if you stimulate one electrode you get spontaneous firing we then use that basic operation by linking it up to the robot body
4124680 one of the things we could look to do is to put sound in and get sound out which essentially means communicating theres no reason why we cant do that and i see that as something what it will mean to the neuron culture by putting audio in and getting different audio out is that it would allow us to whistle to it and teach it in some way to respond back
4124681 simply from the habit of doing things repetitively the neuron connections strengthen and allow the robot to be able to do it more accurately in terms of teaching the cells to do more that is part of the research can we get it to improve by applying different voltage and chemicals and things
4124682 we are doing that now applying chemicals to part of the brain structure so that it stops growing and the neurons will die off and then see if the actions the robot has been doing are taken over so its like looking at what happens in a stroke
4124683 can the brain learn to do things it used to do how can it learn to do the things it used to do the key thing is as we understand things a bit more is to put it into different positions or a particular situation and teach it so that we can see how the memory of what to do in that situation is constructed in the brain by the connection

4124692 he acknowledges that some mistakes were made acknowledges that some lessons have been learned
4124693 he is very aware of my expectations of him in this role that ive placed him in
4124694 my focus since ive been here has been to build a team that i feel will best assist me in making that happen i didnt look at it as a political hire
4124695 to investigate as a potential criminal matter rather than internal affairs they are going to do their investigation they are going to provide their results of that investigation to the district attorney we will find out what if anything the district attorney feels is appropriate to do
4124696 once the da has made that determination internally theyll decide whats an appropriate action
4124697 the way he described it to me and i said i agree is were not going to let anybody off easy
4124698 were going to turn square corners here but were also not going to let anybody get railroaded by a newspaper story
4124699 this is one of these things where i didnt ask him a lot of questions about what exactly is going on because im always hesitant to have information like that lest i say something accidentally and mess them up
4124700 i just got his assurance he told me there was an issue that they were investigating it they were investigating it as a criminal matter and assured me they would turn the information over to the da for processing and then they would deal internally with the matter

4124702 i could not identify them as hostile until they bent down and picked up the weapons
4124703 this was decisive because from that moment on the enemy was on the defensive and no longer on the offensive
4124704 i saw their muzzle flashes and i began to suppress with well placed shots

4124711 goodlatte faces two challengers in his bid for re election to his 6th district house seat in november democrat sam rasoul of blue ridge and janice lee allen of bridgewater rasoul and allen both support massive national efforts to find alternative energy sources to free the country of its dependence on foreign oil
4124712 rasoul opposes drilling in federally protected areas for now he said tuesday he stressed that other steps should be taken first including developing the areas where oil companies already have leases but have yet to act
4124713 rasoul said he would consider drilling in the environmentally sensitive areas years from now if needed
4124714 in recent weeks goodlatte introduced the virginia outer continental shelf act under the proposal virginias governor could petition the federal government for a waiver of the federal moratorium on offshore oil and natural gas exploration the state and federal governments would equally share the revenue from drilling according to the proposal
4124715 goodlatte proposed that 75 percent of the commonwealths share be used to help with such needs as transportation and education the remaining 25 percent would be split evenly between the land and water conservation fund and a reserve fund to address other environmental issues

4124735 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
4124736 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
4124737 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
4124738 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
4124739 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables

4124745 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
4124746 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4124747 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
4124748 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4124749 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4124750 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4124751 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades

4124753 president roosevelt signed the social security act into law on august 14 1935
4124754 c onventional thinking in washington says that social security is the third rail of american politics it says you should hedge and dodge and spin but at all costs dont answer
4124755 clinton sidesteps social security talk obama says in d m
4124756 obama started his campaign saying his plans would not increase taxes for people earning less than 250 000 but he found himself in an apparent contradiction by saying he would tax all income to fund social security not just income up to 102 000 as is now the case
4124757 so now obamas plan calls for no social security tax on income between 102 000 and 250 000 but all income above 250 000 would be taxed for social security
4124758 prior to june 13 2008 obama had kept open the possibility that he would impose the 12 4 percent social security tax on income as low as 97 500 the annually adjusted ceiling in place in 2007
4124759 while obama has suggested imposing the 12 4 percent tax on all income above 97 000 per year edwards would only impose it on those making more than 200 000 per year
4124760 if we kept the payroll tax rate exactly the same but applied it to all earnings and not just the first 97 500 we could virtually eliminate the entire social security shortfall
4124761 under current law income up to 102 000 a year is taxed for social security obama would create a doughnut hole by not imposing new social security taxes on income between 102 000 and 250 000 his aides said income exceeding 250 000 would be taxed at a rate of 2 percent to 4 percent rather than the 6 percent tax that people pay toward social security on income below the 102 000 cutoff which is matched by their employers paying a 6 percent tax employers would probably pay an additional tax but the total tax paid by both employee and employer would not exceed 4 percent of the amount of income earned over 250 000
4124762 projections provided by obamas campaign staff say that uncapping the payroll tax would solve projected shortfalls for at least 75 years
4124763 clinton sidesteps social security talk obama says in d m
4124764 options to adjust social security earnings cap static impact on individual income and payroll tax liability and revenue billions 2009 18
4124765 if all earnings were subject to the payroll tax but the base was retained for benefit calculations the social security trust funds would remain solvent for the next 75 years however the link between contributions and benefits would be broken
4124766 experts predict that obamas proposal would make up less than half of the 4 3 trillion shortfall social security is expected to face over the next 75 years
4124767 and for seniors in particular what i want to do is eliminate the income tax on social security that is something that we werent taxing up until 1993 and if we could eliminate that income tax that would save the average social security recipient up to 1 400 a year which would help to pay for a lot of these rising costs
4124768 the 1993 measure increased to 85 percent from 50 percent the portion of social security benefits subject to income tax when a retirees income including half of his or her annual social security benefit exceeds certain levels those levels are 34 000 for a single person and 44 000 for a married couple
4124769 g o p seeks to repeal tax on social security benefits
4124770 lower and middle income seniors are struggling as their expenses on health and energy skyrocket while their incomes do not keep pace this strain has been greater since 1993 when taxes on social security benefits were raised millions of seniors saw their net benefits go down
4124771 one of the challenges of the week for chicago is finding a way to control the news cycle without the candidate
4124772 the record shows obama to be a fairly doctrinaire liberal democrat
4124773 sen barack obama d ill was the most liberal senator in 2007 according to national journals 27th annual vote ratings
4124774 the insurgent presidential candidate shifted further to the left last year in the run up to the primaries after ranking as the 16th and 10th most liberal during his first two years in the senate
4124775 on the difficult compromises that required the political courage to challenge ones own political constituency obama flinched the gang of 14 compromise on judicial appointments the immigration compromise to which obama tried to append union backed killer amendments and just last month the compromise on warrantless eavesdropping that garnered 68 votes in the senate but not obamas
4124776 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4124777 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4124778 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4124779 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4124780 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4124781 urgente necesidad de respetar y promover los derechos intr nsecos de los pueblos ind genas que derivan de sus estructuras pol ticas econ micas y sociales y de sus culturas de sus tradiciones espirituales de su historia y de su concepci n de la vida especialmente los derechos a sus tierras territorios y recursos

4124783 these madrasas and religious units have received funds from abroad mainly gulf countries we suspect that this money may have been used for the serial blasts and to finance the terror operatives other activities

4124795 we have no interest in acquiring airports we will not be acquiring stansted airport but clearly we will be happy to work with anybody who buys it
4124796 its the same offer we made to the baa five years ago
4124797 weve offered to build a second terminal in stansted in the past and double the traffic but the baa told us to go away
4124798 the only way airports make money is to build passengers numbers

4124809 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4124810 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4124811 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4124812 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
4124813 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
4124814 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
4124815 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4124816 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4124817 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4124818 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4124819 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4124820 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4124821 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos

4124824 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
4124825 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces

4124841 todos preguntan si le pidi la presidenta que dijera eso y la respuesta es no lo dijo porque as lo cree
4124842 es cierto que hay que darle mayor confianza y credibilidad al ndice de inflaci n y es uno de los temas en los que tenemos que trabajar fuerte
4124843 hay cosas que vamos a ir corrigiendo y hay distintos matices a veces las medidas dan resultado y a veces no

4124930 instead of keeping their promise to drain the swamp of corruption in washington house democrats are sinking in it chairman rangels own public admissions about his conduct make clear that his sweetheart deals violate house rules as well as state and federal laws boehner said
4124931 the censure measure was defeated by a vote of 254 138 with two dozen republicans voting with rangel and the democrats
4124932 theres no one in this house thats more thick skinned than i am in terms of playing politics or apparently breaking the law but playing with someones reputation especially someone that has felt so honored to serve in this house i really think goes a step beyond that rangel said to his colleagues on the floor
4124933 rangel has said he would move his campaign office out of the apartment which boehner took as an admission of guilt
4124934 according to boehner and watchdogs rangels acceptance of the reduced rent violated house rules which bar gifts

4124937 ya nggak tau persisnya kita mesti tunggu laporan resmi malaikat seksi indonesia tapi mungkin kalau nggak salah asas tunggal itu sejenis lagu pop
4124938 o ya asyik dong kayak di radio ada racun itu atau kami makan singkong babe makan keju
4124939 saya ini sekedar menirukan mahasiswa mahasiswa itu lho mahasiswa itu biasanya nakal nakal nakal politis nakal intelektual nakal kultural bahkan ada yang nakal seksual kalau mahasiswa nggak nakal koq kurang normal kalau yang lurus lurus saja pakai kacamata kuda dan hanya mengurus sks itu namanya bergaya ternak tapi lha wong sapi aja ada yang nakal masak mahasiswa nggak ada kan rektor dan dekan sebagai mobilisator musti dikasih tantangan
4124940 apakah ilmuwan itu percaya tuhan apa tidak itu tidak penting bahkan seseorang itu ilmuwan apa bukan juga tidak penting
4124941 ah kamu ini memang salah kedaden mustinya kamu ini tidak dilahirkan sebagai malaikat tapi sebagai mahasiswa
4124942 tapi jangan ditanggapi secara dramatis lho itu cuma retorika politik yang diartukulir mlalui bahasa visual atau seni rupa namanya juga politik politik itu khan substansinya memang benar benar tapi cara berpolitik itu mesti opurtunistik itu normal kalau tidak opurtunistik berarti gendheng seperti iklan iklan produksi yang dijual itu harus ngapusi dinamika politik juga bohong artinya dalam mekanisme politik tidak ada ungkapan yang tidak pakai topeng harus dalam politik tidak ada kata kata yang bermakna telanjang kalau itu yah saru ah kamu kayak nggak tau saja
4124943 terus terus omong terus seenaknya mentang mentang polisi nggak bisa nagkap malaikat ya
4124944 lho ini bukan soal ditangkap atau tidak kalau ada yang berani
4124945 kita memang tidak bisa ditangkap tapi yang baca ini lho
4124946 ah jangan berlebih lebihan sebuah kekuasaan yang kuat gagah perkasa dan mapan tidak ada perlunya berurusan
4124947 kalau toh begitu maka cacing cacing itu tidak akan ditangkap
4124948 sure bagaimana kalau kita ambil manusia jilbab itu untuk menjadi sampel penelitian kita
4124949 itu soal gampang kalau aku mau mendirikan biro pembikinan skripsi khusus untuk mahasiswa yang pura pura nggak bisa bikin skripsi kalau perlu disertai doktor pidato gubernur rektor ketua ulama mau pesan fatwa juga bisa
4124950 begini dasar pemikiranku ialah aku memang percaya kepada informasimu mengenai periode sejarah asas tunggal karena kita semua butuh penelitianku terutama karena kita butuh penulisan pspb yang agak relefan dan jujur sekalian hasil penelitian kita ini bisa kita sumbangkan koperasi informasi antar malaikat di abad teknologi yang lagi yahud yahudnya ini
4124951 baiklah baiklah cuma aku usul kita jangan terlalu repot benar dengan kerja penelitian kita tak usah capek bikin quistioner memfoto kopi dan membagi bagikan kalau pakai graunded bisa ngabisin energi kita wawancara global saja suruh mereka bikin esai atau video langsung
4124952 sebab manusia tak bisa berbicara kata kata manusia kini tinggal
4124953 barusan aku mendengar gema itu muncul dari wilayah kalian para malaikat sehingga seolah olah kalianlah yang berbicara
4124954 kata kata manusia kini tinggal gema maka kamilah yang akan

4124960 tidak ada perlindungan bagi aqidah kami yang dimanupulir yang dirajam oleh rumusan rumusan politik yang memabukkan
4124961 kami belajar menyerukan pilihan keberanian iman dan taqwa dan istiqamah di hati nurani kami di akal sehat kami diseluruh jiwa dan kepribadian kami

4124966 the prime minister to respect the result of the irish referendum and abandon the attempt to ratify the lisbon treaty
4124967 the rules of the treaty and the eu are clear all 27 member states must ratify the treaty for it to come into force there is no question of ignoring the irish vote or bulldozing irish opinion ireland clearly cannot be bound by changes which it has not ratified equally there is no appetite for a return to years of institutional negotiation the eu as a whole needs to find a way forward for all countries that allows the eu to focus on the big policy issues that confront us
4124968 never before have there been so many dangerous minds in one place
4124969 we are excited to welcome this recruiting class into the spartan family
4124970 we will look for them to make an immediate contribution to the program and continue to build upon the foundation of michigan state volleyball
4124971 the combination of power athleticism and experience will be evident at the outside hitter position in 2008
4124972 the quality hitters that we have on the outside should be the anchor of a dominant spartan attack that can team with what should be a solid defense
4124973 mischelle and vineece are both extremely capable of filling the middle blocking position
4124974 each of them brings something different to the position and they compliment each other nicely if they play off of each others strengths there is the potential for each of them to make a very big impact
4124975 both carli and allyson are dynamic quick and mentally tough
4124976 their athletic ability and tenacious style will be fun to watch as each of them will vie for the starting position
4124977 defensively this core group could have the makings of something very special
4124978 our passing ball control and defense will be one of our strengths as the year progresses

4124985 agiliance is a company with the right team in place solving the right problems at the right time
4124986 add to that the fact that agiliance has developed an outstanding product and that gives a strategic advisor a lot to work with its not very often that you find a company with all those elements aligned which is why i anticipate my relationship with agiliance will be deeply rewarding and a lot of fun
4124987 having worked closely with members of agiliances executive team in the past i am not surprised at the companys success or that its solution is so well regarded
4124988 if history repeats itself the best is yet to come and i am looking forward to witnessing and supporting the companys future success
4124989 weve had a phenomenal trajectory over the past 18 months and our new advisory board members are indicative of our maturity
4124990 collectively our advisors provide us with expertise that spans a vast spectrum of skills relationships and experience we will rely on their guidance and support as we build out the it grc eco system extend our thought and market leadership fulfill complex enterprise deployments and of course manage our rapid growth
4124991 most of my special measures are rarely popular with the athletes i havent seen any flowers or chocolate in front of my door yet and im shutting down my text messaging
4124992 we had some cases in the past where a wife came girlfriend came and they hang around its not a positive environment
4124993 nhl guys dont take their wives to the stanley cup final and hang around in between the games and why we should we be any different its a professional sport also
4124994 theyre very focused on what they need to accomplish its a business a lot of them earn their living out of this
4124995 positive energy is important but you can also isolate yourself from it thats one of the reasons why we stayed away from the village as long as possible and im happy that we did that
4124996 there are basketball players in the village and millionaires walking around and they cant take their butt out of the cafeteria because somebody comes by all the time
4124997 the no family rule isnt serious and its not meant to be that way i just felt that there were many requests for too many things and all they do is walk around for no good reason thats not needed
4124998 i told him id chop his head off if he came near her
4124999 we have a young group of athletes that could surpass their performances but to climb the podium its going to be awfully difficult
4125000 its going to have to take some magical things and track rarely offers magic
4125001 its safe to say the tendency on the part of science is to scare us and prepare us for the worst and i appreciate it and follow their instructions
4125002 most of you remember atlanta we were supposed to die of dehydration we all survived athens was supposed to be killer from the point of any kind of pollution and we all came home ok
4125003 this represents an important step in iraqs recovery process it brings the whole un organization together in partnership with iraq and its people to reduce poverty foster growth and consolidate democracy in our country
4125004 the strategy signals a real moment of opportunity in iraq with greater stability a clear will to recover a growing un presence and better access to many areas we will now be able to consolidate achievements and shift focus helping iraq to mobilize its substantial capacity and resources while we work to meet outstanding humanitarian needs
4125005 five years later we are now in a position to strengthen our international presence across iraq
4125006 we plan to see faster implementation on the ground and stronger policy guidance in baghdad
4125007 the number of vehicle fires is clearly moving in the right direction reaching its lowest point in more than 20 years
4125008 this report helps us learn why these fires happen which types of fires are more likely to kill or injure people and what people can do to reduce these types of fires even further
4125009 many vehicle fires are preventable and its vital to take steps to reduce your risk of experiencing one
4125010 half of highway vehicle fires are caused by a mechanical failure which highlights the importance of proper vehicle maintenance motorists can help avoid vehicle fires by following manufacturers maintenance schedules and having a comprehensive inspection of their vehicle at least once a year by a trained professional technician such as those at aaa approved auto repair facilities
4125011 more americans age 50 are trying to leave their cars behind but face obstacles as soon as they walk out the door climb on their bikes or head for the bus
4125012 complete streets enable pedestrians bicyclists and public transit riders to share the road safely with automobiles
4125013 more cities and states are adopting policies requiring their transportation agencies to ensure that roads are routinely designed or redesigned for all modes of travel and instituting these new standards makes it safer for residents of all ages
4125014 some cities like sacramento california and kirkland washington are ahead of the curve
4125015 they have extra wide sidewalks flowered medians and flashing lights embedded in crosswalks at busy intersections bike lanes and bus stops line even some of the towns busiest streets these amenities allow residents to be safer pedestrians and commuters and even help the flow of vehicle traffic
4125016 comments attributed to an unnamed lobbyist working for chevron do not reflect our companys view regarding the ecuador case they were not approved by the company and will not be tolerated
4125017 we believe that the arrogance reflected in the anonymous comment accurately reflects a pervasive attitude within chevrons culture that led to the destruction of our precious rainforest
4125018 confirms how chevron cares little for the rule of law in any country where it might be held accountable be it ecuador or the u s
4125019 no court that actually hears the evidence appears to be good enough for chevron
4125020 not a single court in the world ever has agreed with chevrons interpretation of this release but that has not stopped chevrons lobbying team from playing judge and jury to the u s congress
4125021 heat stress costs dairy producers nationwide about 900 million annually in decreased milk production
4125022 the purpose of the talk and the paper is to make clear just how dire the situation is and how rapidly things are getting worse
4125023 its a lot like the issue of climate change that we had ignored for so long if anything the situation in the oceans could be worse because we are so close to the precipice in many ways
4125024 all of the different kinds of data and methods of analysis point in the same direction of drastic and increasingly rapid degradation of marine ecosystems
4125025 just as we say that leatherback turtles are critically endangered i looked at entire ecosystems as if they were a species
4125026 the reality is that if we want to have coral reefs in the future were going to have to behave that way and recognize the magnitude of the response thats necessary to achieve it
4125027 the challenges of bringing these threats under control are enormously complex and will require fundamental changes in fisheries agricultural practices and the ways we obtain energy for everything we do
4125028 so its not a happy picture and the only way to deal with it is in segments the only way to keep ones sanity and try to achieve real success is to carve out sectors of the problem that can be addressed in effective terms and get on it as quickly as possible
4125029 as someone who has interviewed al qaeda members i know that coercive interrogation techniques are ineffective and unreliable
4125030 during my 27 year fbi career i witnessed operatives who had sworn loyalty to bin laden cooperate with the fbi because they were treated humanely a presidential ban on torture and cruelty will ensure that we use effective reliable tools for intelligence gathering and help restore u s standing in eyes of the world
4125031 the catholic church recognizes torture is a moral issue something intrinsically evil and counterproductive in the fight against terrorism
4125032 tortures use can never be justified because it is a direct attack on the dignity of the human person who is created in the image and likeness of god joining with people of many faiths i urge the president to ban torture and cruelty
4125033 delaying medical treatment and regular physicals puts consumers at risk for potential health issues and increases overall health insurance costs
4125034 its critical that consumers continue to take responsibility for their health so that we can all benefit from healthier lives and more affordable healthcare
4125035 insurance is an important and oftentimes mandated purchase for most americans
4125036 that is why the naic and state insurance regulators are committed to helping every american be a smarter insurance consumer
4125037 insurance is one of the easiest ways that consumers can protect themselves against significant financial loss especially during difficult economic times
4125038 its also important that consumers understand their insurance needs and options we urge them to visit insure u to learn more
4125039 in relation to the previous coach we all have certain principles with regards to football that are the same but if we can bring something different of course we are going to do so
4125040 amorebieta had a great season last year is left footed is quick with a good physical presence while iraola has a good deal of experience and i would like to see him close up
4125041 bojan and capel come through from the under 21s and along with their talent give us an injection of young blood that is important
4125042 he is in the same position as many players in spain we didnt think it right to call him up this time but the door is not closed
4125043 the government is afraid of possible bad influences on people who are here for the olympics
4125044 with the strong success of our n ergy tents and our other recreational tents last year we are continuing our focus of encouraging more families to experience the outdoors
4125045 consumers both recreational and frequent participants are reacting well to our designs and accessories our product designers have taken great care to incorporate features for each of these audiences we are committed to making the outdoors more accessible to families especially during a tough economy enjoying the outdoors is a lot easier and more fun if you have the right gear the 2009 eureka products bring the experience closer to home at reasonable price points
4125046 this next series of tech4o products deliver accurate measurements are easy to use and are very affordable
4125047 we have seen rising consumer demand from those interested in gauging their own performance and have incorporated new features based on customer feedback the heart monitor and pc capabilities are on target for a fitness trend that shows no sign of stopping
4125048 an average hitter is around 0 340 or so a great hitter is 0 400 or higher and a poor hitter would be under 0 300

4125127 o sporting venceu o ano passado a ta a de portugal e a superta a mas perdeu o campeonato para o fc porto com 20 pontos de atraso

4125130 a personal mission to rid the world of rubbish food and pathetic service
4125131 we feed them every couple of days a pink liquid with nutrients not too dissimilar to what the olympians might drink for energy it keeps the neurons alive and allows them to grow within twenty four hours they make connections within a week there is a brain like activity if you stimulate one electrode you get spontaneous firing we then use that basic operation by linking it up to the robot body
4125132 one of the things we could look to do is to put sound in and get sound out which essentially means communicating theres no reason why we cant do that and i see that as something what it will mean to the neuron culture by putting audio in and getting different audio out is that it would allow us to whistle to it and teach it in some way to respond back
4125133 simply from the habit of doing things repetitively the neuron connections strengthen and allow the robot to be able to do it more accurately in terms of teaching the cells to do more that is part of the research can we get it to improve by applying different voltage and chemicals and things
4125134 we are doing that now applying chemicals to part of the brain structure so that it stops growing and the neurons will die off and then see if the actions the robot has been doing are taken over so its like looking at what happens in a stroke
4125135 can the brain learn to do things it used to do how can it learn to do the things it used to do the key thing is as we understand things a bit more is to put it into different positions or a particular situation and teach it so that we can see how the memory of what to do in that situation is constructed in the brain by the connection

4125182 that catholics shine a bright line of separation between themselves and all those politicians who defend the abortion regime of roe v wade

4125239 the second music video i directed for dublin band sickboy there are a few idea behind this video two of the band members colm and brian are identical twin brothers like carbon copies of each other which got me interested in the idea of copying and reproduction of images i was also interested in the aesthetic of the home made fliers and self promotional material being produced by local bands often cracked and torn black and white photocopies showing a picture of the band and a date etc also the idea of animating silent photocopies of a face smushed up against the glass of a photocopier to make it appear as though they are singing was part of the idea so i photocopied colms face in a photocopier and got him to move it around as the light from the copier passed his face to create distortions we made hundreds of photocopies with all the main mouth facial shapes needed for lip sync then i shot them playing on whitescreen photocopied the frames etc put the mouth shapes in order and photographed them etc i think it worked out pretty well in the end

4125249 on one side people think higher inflation should mean higher interest rates which would mean a higher domestic currency

4125267 but our designers are finding their personal ways to express themselves and we can already see this
4125268 iranian design is attractive to westerners but it is very difficult to be internationally acceptable when you do not have a national character
4125269 unfortunately only a few of them became professional designers in larger offices and the rest began small studios with only one person working out their home with a personal computer and printer
4125270 being contemporary and at the same time loyal to originality is a very difficult task
4125271 the result is sometimes too popular and ordinary and sometimes repetitive and just a fashion this is where the designer has an important role to play in increasing societys understanding
4125272 i would like to have a style that is comprehensible worldwide i try to be simple indelible and iranian considering contemporary international norms
4125273 im of the view that china will not be the same country after these games certainly its not going to make the liberalization transition and democratic transition that south korea made in 1987 and 88 but there is still something about exposing this concept of olympism and the olympics to 1 3 billion people that is bound to have some sort of effect on the regime
4125274 something remarkable is happening people are seeing this as an unprecedented opportunity to really get themselves their organizations and their communities prepared
4125275 every day we hear from schools businesses and many others about what they are planning and how they are excited to be a part of the shakeout and to encourage others to participate
4125276 all this is coming together in a way that has never happened before
4125277 whats really rewarding as a scientist is to see how the scientific foundation provided by the shakeout scenario seems to be inspiring real preparedness actions throughout the region this is important because its what we do now before a big earthquake that will determine what our lives will be like after

4125286 we were already confident that our tooling and registration systems could cope with anything that people could throw at us but this software is giving us even more of an edge more and more of our work is high layer count product such as ate boards and gemini x is just what we need to enable us to offer our customers even higher tech mass lam we like the way the software learns from each job manufactured to give ever more accurate scale factors
4125287 we are working with 392 000 square feet so one use is not going to be feasible for the project
4125288 i think toledo is actually approaching its downtown the right way because not only do you have the new arena being built downtown you also have the new fifth third field
4125289 what good is a silent memory when the forgotten deserve justice
4125290 the greatest and most powerful single indictment of a political regime ever to be leveled in modern times
4125291 reminded every one of us what we owe to the truth
4125292 320 tons of uranium hexafluoride gas to feed its centrifuges enough for almost 100 bombs if iran begins enriching uranium to weapons grade on an assembly line basis it could transfer this material to groups such as hezbollah and hamas which might fabricate low technology nuclear explosives these would probably have yields nearly as high as the bomb that destroyed hiroshima

4125310 etiquetar un homicidio como ejecuci n es un salvoconducto para la impunidad

4125319 there are estimates that yield loss will be as great as 60 to 80 percent if the fungus attacks when plants are just starting to reproduce
4125320 last year the weather was such that rust invaded the area early in mid september which was unusual in the past it has only developed in middle to late october
4125321 our worry is that the same will happen this year and because of late planting rust developing in mid september could really damage yields
4125322 when rust gets close to missouri and is threatening we will provide daily updates so farmers know what could happen and can prepare to take action if rust does develop
4125323 our effort with the early warning system is to find rust when it first begins to develop in an area because that is the time when farmers would need to apply fungicides to protect their crop
4125324 you could still apply fungicides but yield loss would still occur at that point
4125325 the spores drift with wind currents and can travel for many many miles before they fall out of the sky
4125326 if the spores land on a leaf and dont have some moisture they wont germinate
4125327 current science indicates that these spores need eight to 10 hours of leaf moisture to germinate so the fungus can enter the leaf otherwise the spores will die
4125328 if weather patterns change and rain becomes more frequent in those areas then the disease could start to develop rapidly and spread to this area
4125329 we may see a delay of two to four weeks for harvesting irrigated cotton
4125330 dryland cotton harvest probably will occur within the normal timeframe
4125331 the no 1 insect problem in cotton in the central and south delta is spider mites
4125332 hot dry weather is ideal for spider mite outbreaks and farmers worked hard to control them
4125333 glyphosate resistance is a hot issue in weed control because there are not many alternative chemistries available with the systems we have
4125334 the 2008 crop appears to be as good as or even a little bit above the average but it probably wont surpass the statewide average of 960 pounds per acre reached last year
4125335 the increase had a lot to do with the price of rice when it got to be around 8 we had a great amount of interest in mississippi in growing rice however that increase in acreage was somewhat limited by how much soybean acreage was booked and what a farmer could do to rearrange i even had some folks that were opting out of a soybean contract paying out of that to get in and plant rice
4125336 this year we were right at 25 percent planted by april 15 looking at last year we were about 75 percent planted by the same time april 15
4125337 thats why were staying low in our yield this year because we do have a lot of late acreage weve got rice thats started to head right now and were got rice thats started to flood right now theres not too many times you can say that in one breath
4125338 weather has been the biggest player this year we went from dry to wet now were dry again
4125339 right now youve got to make a crop to make a living there is no room for failure anymore even at 8 rice if you screwed up and lost 20 bushels thats 160 per acre that you just lost
4125340 a lot more producers are putting classic or firstrate in the tank with the roundup and it can somewhat confuse your syptomology on what youre actually looking at it can look almost like a newpath but it ultimately ends up being a glyphosate with an als type herbicide such as classic or firstrate
4125341 it would be hard for any american to say no to that

4125350 el compromiso de las marcas con los medios digitales en latinoam rica en los ltimos dos a os es muy bajo comparado con otros mercados en t rminos de comprensi n una cosa es decir vamos a invertir dinero para publicitarnos en medios digitales y otra es entenderlo
4125351 y no funciona as porque internet y los celulares son medios masivos pero son medios individualmente masivos son masivos porque llegan a toda la poblaci n pero no son masivos en t rminos de que no hay un programa espec fico que todo el mundo est mirando a las misma hora un ejemplo claro es youtube
4125352 zenith bank plc has declared gross earnings of n158 29 billion for the financial year ending june 30 2008 indicating a 67 per cent increase over the n94 88 billion declared last year
4125353 the unaudited result for the 2007 2008 financial year released on the floor of the nigerian stock exchange also showed improved profitability with profit before tax jumping by an impressive 96 per cent from the n25 67 billion recorded last year to n50 28 billion for the year under review
4125354 equally impressive the result showed is profit after tax which jumped by 119 per cent from the n18 77 billion recorded last year to n41 04 billion
4125355 the message from investors to corporates is that if we are headed for a recession they should clean up their balance sheets and prepare a financial buffer

4125357 the market appears to have overreacted to a fall in the oil price and investors have turned a blind eye to second round effects of inflation such as rising wages
4125358 it will take several months of slowing global growth to be sure that the inflationary dragon has been slain
4125359 when they take down the names of the 54 buddies of mine from the vietnam war memorial then ill reconsider
4125360 maybe those friends of yours who are questioning my patriotism should ask these questions themselves
4125361 i chose my family rather than a command in the aleutian islands
4125362 besides have you ever heard of anyone in helicopters making general you need to be a fighter pilot
4125363 why give them this when they have all these leases they are sitting on and not drilling
4125364 when i started this the dnc did nothing to help me i decided to run because i was tired of unopposed congressional races
4125365 because im not running this as a partisan race the folks back in washington are nervous
4125366 thats why im out here talking to any group who will let me in their doors
4125367 many of you are republicans and if youre honest with yourselves youre not very happy with your party
4125368 waste water is probably the single biggest need for federal funding the in the district i fully support the regional plant
4125369 we need electronic surveillance and real border patrol agents to president bushs credit he wanted to hire 2 000 new agents each year but congress wouldnt authorize the funding theyve done nothing we need to secure our borders
4125370 we need to get back to doing responsible logging in our forests and getting salvage logging going in burn areas
4125371 i just need to put myself out there more in the first 50 and ill be ok
4125372 finally im in the meet and tomorrow i can relax and do my race a little bit better
4125373 it just didnt happen some days your body just doesnt work my body picked a bad time not to work
4125374 i do really well just kind of being in a stable environment
4125375 not traveling much not switching things up much maybe if it hadnt been quite as long it would have been better
4125376 even though i had disappointing swims i went to the olympics
4125377 i feel like im just beginning on my way hopefully ill go on to bigger and better things in the future
4125378 two or three of us will go under the record for sure
4125379 im going to take a look at the video i know theres a couple things i can work on
4125380 you look at bernard and sullivan and theyve been performing at their best for six months now so theyre on the top
4125381 its up to us older folks to come in there and slip it away from them
4125382 its something ive never experienced swimming two different races in the same day especially coming off such a big final
4125383 but if you dont believe youre going to swim fast and you can do it just dont come out and swim because youre not going to give yourself a chance
4125384 you cant hold back in the semis especially the 50
4125385 its probably going to be 0 1 between the top eight its going to be ridiculously fast
4125386 senate president pro tem don perata began wednesday saying he had made enough concessions to secure a budget deal with the governor and called for republicans to sign on
4125387 but the day ended with little progress as perata concluded that negotiations remained at impasse
4125388 were huddling now and trying to see what our next step will be
4125389 by the end of the day peratas optimism clearly had been quashed
4125390 in the five hours between peratas two comments it became clear that republican leaders were not joining peratas call for a vote neither were assembly democrats nor schwarzenegger

4125392 dude ive been reading these since 14 in the first series
4125393 gary millers kennedy vs the machine was one of the most important things to happen in the blogosphere in the last two years
4125394 gary ive continued to enjoy reading kvm throughout the campaign youd make a great reporter and please dont take that as an insult
4125395 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever
4125396 gary miller who started kvm and is as good a blogger as exists has not wavered in his criticism of zogbys methodology
4125397 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
4125398 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
4125399 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
4125400 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
4125401 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
4125402 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant
4125403 gary thanks for choosing me and inviting other rational conservatives to do the same
4125404 me and warrick are the same size theyve compared me a lot to him so right now im just trying to learn from him and follow his footsteps
4125405 hes picked up the offense and now hes starting to let his natural ability take over
4125406 hes a smart football player hes very instinctive he picks things up fast hes a guy that simulates warrick dunn when warrick isnt being featured on the practice field he should have been drafted it was a mistake we made here in tampa but we got him
4125407 when i didnt get a phone call i stayed in bed for about three days
4125408 we are very much playing to win in small cars
4125409 after the model t gm predicted that more power more styling more comfort and more prestige would sell en masse
4125410 they created the modern car business to do just that offer more choices and remarkably they continued to do it successfully for decades
4125411 we are a nation obsessed with the new that gm has survived 100 years says they have done a lot of the right things for a long time
4125412 my manager and agent just called to tell me that ive been offered a guest appearance on a new comedy series airing on fox this fall
4125413 i will be playing a guest checking into the hotel and i am going to film my scenes sometime next week i think is hysterical have you guys seen his video on that website funny or die and i cant wait to meet niecy nash
4125414 as a security precaution the jelly runner on this installation is
4125415 this may very well become the most devastating marine invasion in history
4125416 there is probably no way to stop the invasion completely
4125417 but weve not seen such a large predatory invasion in the ocean before
4125418 i think at the best they will have a huge impact on reef fish and at the worst will result in the disappearance of most reef fish
4125419 it was so painful it made me want to cut my own hand off
4125420 we have gotten sharks to successfully eat a lionfish but it has been a lot of work most of our attempts with the moray eel have been unsuccessful
4125421 a doctors office is always on the brink of chaos
4125422 the most difficult challenge facing gm and the other domestic producers will be accelerating the introduction of fuel efficient vehicles and convincing consumers that these vehicles offer as good a value proposition as asian products
4125423 its good to see that the government has started using taxation policies as a tool to achieve its energy efficiency goals
4125424 at this point theres nothing standing in our way of continuing to do what we said were going to do
4125425 all those things result in lots of other mechanical parts and bits and pieces that have nothing to do with electrical energy
4125426 such that the vehicle is not just a battery on wheels
4125427 itll have a similar set of visual cues and some of the features that were on the concept car

4125442 just retirement strives to be a leading provider of equity release solutions offering excellent value for money
4125443 we know consumers are feeling the pinch enough at present so we hope this gesture will help those looking to reduce outgoings and boost income in retirement
4125444 this is especially true when you combine this with the flexibility offered by just retirements drawdown product which means individuals only pay interest on the amount they draw down and not on the overall agreed amount
4125445 this also highlights how equity release mortgages are now as good value as many standard mortgages
4125446 my nephew edward is most undoubtedly and indisputably a prig a damned prig

4125459 wir haben zum einen eine stetig anwachsende nachfrage zum anderen aber auch steigende kleiderspenden auch f r erwachsene dadurch hatten wir zuletzt erhebliche platzprobleme

4125480 i am a practicing catholic but ive long ignored catholic teaching about contraception and my married life has been so much happier since
4125481 the church should trust people to just use and follow their conscience
4125482 the pope is an old celibate guy how can we possibly take his advice on marriage contraception and abortion he has no idea what hes talking about
4125483 its all right officer im mike leigh and these are just actors improvising a brawl nothing to see move along please
4125484 coach donaldson was contacted last year about giving and we felt it was our turn this year
4125485 if we can help youngsters continue to play the game they love it is well worth giving a little of our time for them these youngsters are the future of our sport
4125486 my aim was to improve on what i did at the trials and i did that so i m happy i knew it was going to be a fast race so i knew i couldnt afford to ease back
4125487 so to come out here and make the final is pretty good
4125488 ive taken four seconds off my pb after taking six or seven off just to make the olympics and if you said to me a year ago i was going to be in an olympic final i would have said whatever
4125489 in the warm up i felt rubbish i did a couple of sprints and felt amazing so i thought it was going to be brilliant then i dived in and felt awful again
4125490 i dont have any excuses its gutting and im annoyed that im not going back out there because its what i enjoy
4125491 its a long way to come for 20 odd seconds the highlight of my games was carrying the flag around at the opening ceremony swimming is not the be all and end all of my life

4125495 what would make me as a user add this application
4125496 unfortunately people will not flock to put something on their profiles just because you care about it people will put something on their profile because it provides value to them
4125497 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4125498 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4125499 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4125500 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4125501 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4125502 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4125503 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4125504 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4125505 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4125506 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4125507 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

4125510 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4125511 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

4125528 while information about the new rule is certainly welcome our experience tells us it is unlikely that the average ofw will be entering or leaving saudi arabia with more than us 16 000 or about p704 000
4125529 if anything ofws will enter the ksa deep in debt and then leave with several months salary still owing to them

4125556 pythons could have even more significant environmental and economic consequences if they were to spread from florida to other states
4125557 although other factors such as type of food available and suitable shelter also play a role burmese pythons and other giant constrictor snakes have shown themselves to be highly adaptable to new environments
4125558 by using more complete climate data in this case 19 variables measuring climatic extremes averages and seasonal variation we can make more accurate predictions of species distributions
4125559 combining this climatic data with localities for the burmese python allows us to create powerful models for predicting suitable habitat for the snakes
4125560 the burmese python is strongly limited to the small area of suitable environmental conditions in the united states it currently inhabits due to the ecological niche preferences of the snake
4125561 global warming is predicted to significantly reduce the area of suitable habitat worldwide underscoring the potential negative effects of climate change for many species

4125586 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4125587 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4125588 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4125589 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

4125597 when things went so well in the group phase i was told by the guys that i should reconsider my decision that i should go on
4125598 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4125599 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

4125621 he has an opportunity to impress me and force his way into my thinking whether he takes that is up to him
4125622 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4125623 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4125624 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4125625 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4125626 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4125627 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4125628 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4125629 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4125630 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4125631 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4125632 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4125633 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4125634 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4125635 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4125636 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4125637 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4125638 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4125639 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4125640 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4125641 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4125642 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4125643 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4125644 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4125645 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4125646 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4125647 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4125648 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4125649 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4125650 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4125651 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4125652 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4125653 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

4125663 today was done covertly 25 years ago by the cia
4125664 at the outbreak of violence russia had tried to have the united nations security council issue a statement calling on georgia and south ossetia to immediately lay down weapons however washington was disinterested
4125665 the war in georgia is a war for the west
4125666 this is not about georgia any more it is about america its values
4125667 urgent event russian georgian war a challenge for the u s and the world

4125670 so why dont you shut up oh and by the way send some more of your military advisors to georgia they are doing a sterling job and they look all funny down the night sight all green
4125671 look some of the things that happen to guys on the cover theyre legitimate
4125672 vinnie young for example we put him on the cover last year he missed a game and hed never missed a game in his life
4125673 hed never had surgery in his life ever but the year he was on the cover he went under the knife so these kind of things get into peoples minds
4125674 the media tends to play this sort of thing up but i mean the chances of a player being injured in the nfl are so high that we laugh it all off because its unfounded
4125675 no way weve spoken to plenty of guys from within the league and they dont think its a jinx the players who we work closely with they definitely dont think its a jinx because they know better than anyone how easy it is to get injured or to have a bad season
4125676 every year we get 100 guys calling us begging to appear on the cover its a big deal
4125677 shaun alexander told us after he got hurt he was injured during the 2006 season after appearing on the cover of madden 07 that hed rather be on the cover and injured than not be on the cover and stay healthy all year
4125678 this generation of guys in the league now grew up playing madden to them its the wheaties box of the 21st century
4125679 theyre not overstating the problem if anything these are low ball estimates
4125680 the economic impact of those deaths will cost canada 8 billion in 2008 and over 250 billion by 2031
4125681 he confirmed this in writing to the swimming federation weve also spoken with the national olympic committee and they have underlined to us that all their athletes compete here in the right spirit against athletes from any nationality
4125682 we take both the athlete and the national olympic committee at their word on this
4125683 a region of the brain called the striatum is involved in the processing of faces and in particular the attractiveness of faces
4125684 alcohol consumption stimulates activity in this brain region so this might explain how alcohol effects how we process faces generally and attractiveness in particular though social factors might modify this effect in real life
4125685 there is no truth to this rumor its an old one wasnt true then or now madonna is starting her tour in a week

4125698 we dont have any obvious things out on the fire scenes at this point
4125699 our growth both externally as well as internally was massive the sheer number of new servers and their associated applications proved especially challenging as we attempted to reconcile our business expansion within the physical limits of our current infrastructure we knew virtualization was a means through which we could effectively and intelligently approach our integration challenges
4125700 the position of the russia side is not proceed beyond the peacekeeping zone but we have to respond to provocations
4125701 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4125702 we dont want them here what we need is friendship and good relations with the russian people
4125703 we let her stay here and now shes blaming everything on us
4125704 the white population is older and very much centered around the aging baby boomers who are well past their high fertility years
4125705 the future of america is epitomized by the young people today they are basically the melting pot we are going to see in the future
4125706 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4125707 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4125708 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4125709 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4125710 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4125711 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4125712 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4125713 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4125714 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4125715 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4125716 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4125717 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4125718 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

4125720 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4125721 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4125722 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4125723 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4125724 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4125725 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4125726 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

4125741 i look at it as a guy with his dick in my wife
4125742 i want her to be happy and its a turn on in a way on the downside though there are guys having sex with your wife
4125743 oh look the view is on you like that show mom dont you
4125744 and then theres the fact that you dont even get to have sex with her all that often intercourse is off limits before a shoot and afterward shes too tired and sore
4125745 sorry dear im too sore from being all day by guys with 3 times the size of yours
4125746 hun can you help me comb this dryed semen out of my hair
4125747 she hardly ever wears her wedding ring even off set
4125748 oh my god i am so sore the guy i today had an enormous dick that was like five times the size of yours
4125749 we have a long standing tradition in district 200 of trying to promote recycling and reusing this just was a natural extension of some of the things we were already doing
4125750 many of our teenage students are looking forward to their drivers education classes so the fuel emissions lessons and information on gas station etiquette will be strong lessons academically and personally
4125751 i like to think that aside from my unusual day job im a fairly typical mac user
4125752 most of the time the computers ive purchased have been supremely reliable i actually had only two that had to be returned to apple for repairs one was the dreaded powerbook 5300ce a member of a product family that was doomed almost from the beginning to be endlessly defective the other a second generation powerbook g3 that required a new video cable that too was a chronic problem with that particular product family
4125753 we dont know whether or not theres an effect in people
4125754 we tested a total of four moisturising creams and all four of them had tumorigenic activity
4125755 the products they tested had multiple ingredients with no consistent overlap so it is hard to identify which agents if any could be implicated
4125756 moisturizers are used more in women than in men yet we do not see a relative increase in skin cancer in women compared with men
4125757 there is no evidence of danger to humans in this study but the message to scientists is clear be careful in assuming that seemingly inert creams will have no interference with animal experiments

4125759 legitimate reasons for rejecting the texts not because they contained religious viewpoints but because they omitted important topics in science and history and failed to teach critical thinking

4125768 i just had to share something that came up today and it made me feel a bit sick to my stomach so heres the visual two paparazzi come up out of nowhere like usual and start throwing questions at me one of them being hey lindsay what do you have to say about people commenting on your sisters implants wow
4125769 did you really just ask me that she is a 14 year old girl and you are a pedophile
4125770 i was caught out of nowhere so i didnt really come up with the proper response at the time theres many other things that i felt like saying but why give it to a random guy with a camera so that he can make money
4125771 all i am trying to say is is that i was raised with a wonderful family surrounding me of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
4125772 i am not judging people that do but i am just saying that its not something that my family finds necessary to do especially when youre not even fully developed yet it is hard enough being 14 years old and you have enough insecurities to begin with then add being in the public eye
4125773 thirty years is pretty good and the show is still very popular
4125774 larry and i will have a bowl of mueslix and a small shot of prune juice and be in bed by nine oclock
4125775 well let people file by the bed and watch us go to sleep i think we can hang with the best of them until midnight

4125779 tony campolo has tried to straddle the fence for years on the issue of homosexuality
4125780 i remember saying to tony what i feel here is something of what i have always imagined i would feel in heaven
4125781 but i fell in love with provincetown not in spite of the gay and lesbian culture there but because of it and i have been going back for twenty years
4125782 do not think that i have come to abolish the law or the prophets i have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them i tell you the truth until heaven and earth disappear not the smallest letter not the least stroke of a pen will by any means disappear from the law until everything is accomplished
4125783 she took her job seriously and really looked after her district she was always friendly full of life and ready to dig right in and tackle any problem
4125784 dot had a great personality but she could hold her own with anybody she stood firm on what she believed in
4125785 it was obviously a controversial issue but some people were paying the fee while others were throwing their garbage in ditches or wherever they could find a place
4125786 our backs as a county were up against the wall because we were having to subsidize solid waste very heavily and we were mandated to report how we were disposing of our garbage
4125787 dot like all of us was a big advocate for requiring all residents to pay their fair share and she never backed down
4125788 she had a love for the county and worked hard for the people she represented
4125789 i will also remember her as a good grandmother and mother she really loved the children
4125790 it is very saddening that a person like dot has passed away she will be missed
4125791 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
4125792 we are losing money on every sale but we will make it up in volume
4125793 eventually wed like to make some money of out youtube but even if we dont even if ultimately its a loss leader the fact that so many people come to youtube means they ultimately come to google and click on ads
4125794 casey had to deal with the baby coming and it had to stop but even after we stopped having sex we would still kiss occasionally
4125795 i still see him all the time at least once a week
4125796 kelli and casey have been a couple on and off for a few years they were a really tight couple but i think it was hard for kelli having jamie lynn in the picture
4125797 we always understood that soldiers traveling on duty were reimbursed by the military for the fees on required excess baggage
4125798 her main aim i think in any decision shes made is in trying to keep her family whole
4125799 her health is an overriding decision in that especially when youve got young children involved it might be different if all your children were grown but when you have a third grader and a fifth grader youve got to above all prepare for a time when you might not be there
4125800 every decision she has made or will make is about the protection of her children
4125801 the most shocking thing was seeing him on tv give these half truths these half baked answers
4125802 i wish for the well being of everybody involved you know both families i wish he would have just come clean
4125803 look hon there are too many things stacked against us right now and we should get out while the getting is good and concentrate on us our family
4125804 we cant travel without passports theres no point in any case the plane has left and tsvangirai has already gone back he has no patience for this
4125805 this is a loud message to sadc we have been trying to tell president mbeki about things like this and people wouldnt believe us but now here it is for all to see
4125806 oh yes of course we got our independence after how many talks hundreds and tens of meetings had been held
4125807 i am there at the talks to protect the will of the people and we are taking a principled stand i maintain a principled stand to defend the will of the people
4125808 i still have back problems from the last limbo contest i was in
4125809 downtown does need more restaurants however in this case its not feasible consider two major roadblocks
4125810 i know the guys who are opening this and i think they are going to do a great job
4125811 the one bar downtown where a person over 25 can have a good time so many great bands and fun nights closed for a gimmick college bar that wont last
4125812 its going to be a sad day to see paulies go
4125813 wouldnt it be refreshing if just once someone would not complain about downtown and do something themselves
4125814 if you cant find a family friendly restaurant when youre downtown then youre not looking at all
4125815 i am curious as to how the mayor of bloomington can also be head of the liquor commision isnt that a conflict of interest
4125816 wouldnt it be refreshing if just once someone wanted to open a family friendly business so people attending an event at the arena or performing arts center had a place to dine visit after their event
4125817 there always used to be a particular city that was the centre of cool at a particular point in time
4125818 but now theres no longer a place where its at theres no longer any centre of the worlds popular cultural universe for a time it seemed it would be a simple matter of shifting from london to tokyo but instead street style is everywhere and in places youd never have guessed it would be

4125822 american apparel and uniqlo are doing what vice did which is to stop using expensive models and photoshop they use point and shoot photography which is more honest and exciting cheap digital cameras and the internet popularised that
4125823 theyre now transmitted laterally and collaboratively via the internet you once had a series of gatekeepers in the adoption of a trend the innovator the early adopter the late adopter the early mainstream the late mainstream and finally the conservative but now it goes straight from the innovator to the mainstream
4125824 were more of a news magazine than a fashion magazine
4125825 even if were writing about a band we try to put some social context in it were the economist meets rolling stone but back when rolling stone was good
4125826 in 2008 the only prevailing trend is that there are no prevailing trends
4125827 its not just designers who are contributing to the end of boldface trends consumers too are rejecting the commandments of the editorial elite taking inspiration from peers around the world to craft their own interpretations of style rather than buy into one trend from head to toe like the preppy or punk movements of decades past consumers are appropriating eclectic influences and remixing them like a dj does with music
4125828 its pick and mix its retroactive and its nostalgic so you get a chronological misfit of products and references mashed together to create something completely different think about nu rave its a product of eighties romanticism a product of punk a product of straight edge and of old rave the growth in cool hunting websites and businesses has led to the decay of the traditional time scheme between an emerging group doing something and it being spotted embraced and codified it used to be a year then it was six months now its about six days we have 3 500 trend spotters stationed around the world i sit down with them four times a year and well find that the same trend has cropped up in about 25 different cities

4125929 the joint business agreement will enable the airlines to reduce costs and attract new customers helping to mitigate pressure on fares from record fuel costs
4125930 this means that the airlines will have greater ability to invest in their products services and fleets employees and shareholders will also benefit from the agreement
4125931 there is no reason why fares should rise if this agreement is approved
4125932 make no mistake if this monster monopoly is approved it will be third time unlucky for consumers
4125933 it will still be bad for passengers bad for competition and bad for the uk and us aviation industry

4125938 what i wanted to do is show my best performance here in
4125939 im glad that i won this race i was going to improve my time a bit more but to win this race is more important than to set a good time
4125940 i didnt feel pressure before the competition i tried to relax
4125941 and in the race i just swam at my own pace not caring about others my coach said to me that we will have two chinese swimmers in the final so you dont need to force yourself to win gold you just need to try your best
4125942 the pressure was much less we swam together and i felt like we were in training

4125957 its hard to remember now but before social security nearly half of americas seniors lived in poverty
4125958 after a lifetime of playing by the rules and working hard there was no guarantee of a secure retirement my grandfather franklin delano roosevelt and a majority of americans thought that was wrong they believed that lifting our seniors out of poverty is a reflection of our nations core values
4125959 thats why my grandfather signed the social security act seventy three years ago today
4125960 one of the great successes of the 20th century today social security lifts nearly 13 million seniors and 1 3 million children out of poverty
4125961 back in 1935 a small minority did not share those values
4125962 i think the numbers that came out today suggest that demand weakness in the u s could continue

4125970 it is clear that interruptions are a major cause of low productivity among programmers why the problem is not the time needed to handle the interruptions themselves but the time needed to get back into the programming problem everybody no matter what they do face a reorientation time when they return to their work after an interruption when you are reading a magazine article and look up to answer a question it takes you longer to read the next paragraph than if you had been reading continuously

4126038 people always say you must have been really smart or really strong to survive the holocaust i tell them i wasnt smart or strong i was fortunate
4126039 if you read about whats happening in darfur and substituted the words jewish community there were definite parallels to the holocaust
4126040 we owe it to our kids to complicate their thinking the easy thing to do would be to give kids easy black and white answers to their questions
4126041 this is a difficult time in history to have to confront as teachers we have to help facilitate that confrontation but we have to be intellectually honest
4126042 you cant teach this by depicting jews as peripheral to the holocaust or asserting that the holocaust is universal and could have happened to anyone
4126043 the holocaust is a chapter in the history of anti semitism and the jewish people and you have to start with that when teaching about this subject
4126044 as catholics we deal a lot with social injustices its part of our seven principles of catholic social teaching
4126045 were a few generations removed from the holocaust its important to teach this so that we dont lose the message
4126046 its important to give students a sense of jewish life during that time and not just death
4126047 to say never again is not enough we have to act and get involved

4126108 we dont really want to give any info on how we use it as an investigative tool to help the bad guys

4126110 ive seen them in cases from new york city to small towns whoever can afford to get the equipment and plant it on a car
4126111 and of course its easy to do you can sneak up on a car and plant it at any time
4126112 but i dont think thats something detectives would be too happy to put out there like that
4126113 they do have different techniques they like to use on suspects but they dont really want people to know
4126114 a police officer could do the same thing with his or her own eyes
4126115 it helps to cut down on the number of police officers who would have to be out tracking particular cars
4126116 while it may be true that police can conduct surveillance of people on a public street without violating their rights tracking a person everywhere they go and keeping a computer record of it for days and days without that person knowing is a completely different type of intrusion
4126117 things that would have seemed fantastic 15 years ago are now routine
4126118 we have to rethink what is a reasonable expectation of privacy
4126119 the issue is whether the more sophisticated tools are doing the same things we used to do or are creating a different set of legal circumstances
4126120 this statement is to say that after so much speculation and comments the actors dolores fonzi and gael garcia bernal are indeed expecting a baby at the start of next year
4126121 we are not planning to attack anyone but our partners should clearly understand that the armed forces will be used if necessary to protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the russian federation and its allies including on a preventative basis including with the use of nuclear weapons
4126122 military force can and must be used to demonstrate the decisiveness of the top leadership of the country
4126123 what baluyev sky means is the enhanced deterrence doctrine which was created in the united states
4126124 soon we will not be able to maintain missile defense
4126125 under these conditions a potential enemy will gain the ability to carry out high precision strikes coordinated in terms of time and space on practically any target on russian territory
4126126 as for our allies we will see whos ready to join our nuclear umbrella

4126134 the lack of money changing hands in open source licensing should not be presumed to mean that there is no economic consideration

4126139 the notoriety that was brought to bear on one particular juror whose name and background have been widely publicized in the media

4126141 links many aspects of a persons life home family work citizenship and residency status criminal history and finances in a single convenient record and no effort is made to place restrictions on public access to information that is not ordinarily in the public domain
4126142 federal finances are in a catastrophic condition and are getting worse
4126143 the current national debt is 9 5 trillion and the debt ceiling was recently raised to 10 6 trillion to give congressional spenders a little breathing room total unfunded liability for americas two big retirement programs social security and medicare is more than 100 trillion
4126144 where is the government going to get the money necessary to pay even a fraction of these obligations
4126145 salvaging the federal governments finances will require a comprehensive systematic reevaluation of programs to identify those which are of dubious constitutional authority unnecessary wasteful or sometimes all three at once

4126147 the commission to cut wasteful government will be instructed to be even tougher than the grace commission rather like a grace commission on steroids the panel will be directed to evaluate every federal government program office agency and department according to the following criteria
4126148 first is there constitutional authority for the expenditure regulation or agency
4126149 second if the program has a constitutional basis is that activity best conducted by the national government or better carried out by states and localities
4126150 finally assuming the program is constitutional and best provided at the federal level is the specific initiative cost effective that is do the costs outweigh the benefits
4126151 the commissions report will become the basis for my administration to identify and prioritize government programs activities outlays offices departments and regulations to be eliminated or cut back
4126152 controlling and reining in federal finances will not be easy
4126153 they had four major and respected law firms advising them as well as lazard
4126154 and all of them all of them were advising the board that there was zero value in a bankruptcy for shareholders as well as losses to creditors

4126156 the board acted properly and faced with the prospect of not one bankruptcy but bankruptcies in which the shareholders would have gotten nothing and the bondholders would have lost billions theres no basis for this court to second guess the boards judgment
4126157 the government had such a close relationship with the industry that you couldnt tell where one ended and the other began

4126165 i think the events of the last few days show that there are many places in the world where we dont necessarily anticipate this kind of conflict breaking out
4126166 it does require a steady hand on the tiller and an experienced one
4126167 weve got a real clear choice to make and i say it respectfully to sen obama because hes a gifted young man but hes not ready to be president
4126168 the kind of interconnect between parts of the system will allow the equivalent of two full length feature dvd movies to be moved around in the space of a second
4126169 its quite an extraordinary thing its the first time a preacher has convened the two presumptive candidates they are both fighting for that vote
4126170 if we want to put our economy on the right track and fight terrorism then we need political stability unless we bring political stability i think we cant fight them properly he said

4126176 he must not have read our proposal if he did he must not understand it
4126177 i applaud what theyre doing over there but what they dont understand is if we tried to bring their proposal to the floor in the senate it would never get 60 votes
4126178 what weve done is sit down and try to come together and craft something that will get a successful vote of 60 senators i dont know if it will or not but i do know theirs would not
4126179 sen conrads problem is that i do understand the proposal unfortunately sen conrad does not understand the issue perhaps his staff briefed him too quickly
4126180 as for sen chambliss remark let me be clear i havent accused any of them of acting out of principle

4126186 they are dragging their feet in forcing these banks to reserve realistically some of these banks could have been closed two or three quarters earlier

4126514 the media tends to play this sort of thing up but i mean the chances of a player being injured in the nfl are so high that we laugh it all off because its unfounded
4126515 no way weve spoken to plenty of guys from within the league and they dont think its a jinx the players who we work closely with they definitely dont think its a jinx because they know better than anyone how easy it is to get injured or to have a bad season
4126516 every year we get 100 guys calling us begging to appear on the cover its a big deal
4126517 shaun alexander told us after he got hurt he was injured during the 2006 season after appearing on the cover of madden 07 that hed rather be on the cover and injured than not be on the cover and stay healthy all year

4126559 the wittenberg reformers presupposed that the almighty creator had fashioned his human creatures in his image
4126560 the wittenberg theologians including philipp melanchthon johannes bugenhagen justus jonas and a half dozen others was a group with a common commitment to proclaim the gospel of jesus christ and to do so according to a model they adopted and adapted from their mentor luther
4126561 because they had no epistemological theory articulating how presuppositions shaped assertions in their own thought individuals within the wittenberg circle too often did not recognize that they shared concerns with their opponents but expressed them in a different manner or with a different topic or doctrine
4126562 wittenberg theology attempted to hold in tension the total responsibility for all things that belongs by definition to the creator with the limited but complete responsibility he has assigned to his human creatures within their own spheres of activity
4126563 the struggles within the wittenberg circle to express the biblical message regarding the creator and the human creature illustrate how theologians experiment with expressions for their ideas employing different terms and doctrinal synonyms in the search for the best way of proclaiming the christian message and how they attempt to solve the dilemmas of doing so effectively in different topical locations sometimes on gods side sometimes on the human side

4126958 the rangers asked me if i would like to play for the new york rovers their affiliate in the eastern hockey league

4126961 i needed at least another week but they wanted me to play i was in a game in clinton n y and i got a breakaway an opposing player stuck out his leg and tripped me i broke my femur and it ended my career dorrington tried a comeback three seasons later but lasted only five games

4126971 i played ball for pop a very soft spoken guy and at the time i didnt know much about him after i retired i worked for the atlantic city department of recreation we built pop lloyd stadium right across from my house and i continue to maintain the field
4126972 honus wagner said lloyd was one of the greatest shortstops who ever played and that he would have played major league baseball if he wasnt black

4127063 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

4127180 ever successful in orchestrating and delivering superb health care services the nmsc strength undoubtedly lies in its collective ability to unite 31 distinctive specialties of administrators clinicians and scientists into a galvanizing force inherently focused on the care and support of our sailors mariners and their families and our nations veterans
4127181 i spent six years as an enlisted sailor and came into the msc on a navy scholarship i joined the msc because it is the most diversified corps in the navy
4127182 then the health service paid back quite a bit of my student loans
4127183 i joined the msc to get wonderful experiences i was prior enlisted and to become a navy officer is a wonderful thing the msc has a long proud history of medical readiness and have faced their role successfully
4127184 i chose the navy because i wanted to make a difference in peoples lives
4127185 with the navy hospital corps i have the best opportunity to do this there are more opportunities here than in civilian life sure we make sacrifices for the education we receive and we are appreciative of that but in the navy the travel and benefits are second to none
4127186 we have a sense of belonging and a sense of tradition its something you dont get in the civilian sector
4127187 it gives the students an edge for transferring to a higher level college and for getting a job particularly in another area

4127211 its a long time its about time that somebody else takes the throne and im very happy for him i really truly am
4127212 you know theres a lot of pressure that hes going to have on his shoulders over the next number of years i think hell weather it just fine and im going to be rooting him on
4127213 somebody once told me that greatness is a manner of measure which others judge themselves by
4127214 and i think if michael has judged his dreams by something that i have done then i take that as a compliment and im willing and ready and so excited for him
4127215 ive always said if the suit was making the swimmers go fast than i should buy tiger woods golf clubs
4127216 and you and i if we just hold them were going to play like that but thats not the case
4127217 i know that they had some studies about that suit about eight years ago and they said a swimmer had to go faster than about 6 miles an hour to get the full effect that would mean swimmers that were 50 meter swimmers would be the only ones who would benefit from it michael did not swim in that full suit in the first race in the 400 individual medley he used a smaller version of it so i think its a personal choice
4127218 i really take my hat off to his concentration over the last four years
4127219 i mean he really had a crack of breaking my record of seven gold medals in 2004 we talked about that four years ago and unfortunately one of the relays didnt come through for him they didnt get the gold medal so to stay focused for four years and to master all of the pressure that hes gotten is just remarkable
4127220 i think im the only guy certainly that knows what hes going through and right now this is the hardest time
4127221 this next two gold medals and the relay hes probably second guessing himself a little bit perhaps about boy can i get out of not wanting to swim an event and look gracious about it and having a perfect score of maybe 7 for 7 and not having a loss
4127222 and hes not thinking about times either i think hes thinking about not a world record but just to get that gold medal
4127223 you dont go to the olympics just to say i am going to go especially because of who i am i am going to sit there and watch michael phelps break my record anonymously thats almost demeaning to me it is not almost it is
4127224 some reporters thought that i was supposed to be invited by some entity and i told them that wasnt really the case that doesnt happen that way
4127225 im sort of disappointed that i wasnt there but that interview somehow took a different turn ive done hundreds and hundreds of them and ive been true to form about the way i feel about michael hes doing a great job for the united states and inspiring a lot of great performances by the other u s team members
4127226 he is the single greatest olympic athlete of all time now
4127227 he will be probably the single greatest athlete compared to anybody in any century the 20th the 21st century whatever
4127228 weve corrected quite a bit on oil despite a lot of bullish news the sentiment has been bearish
4127229 we find it ironic that the union and its supporters are turning to the initiative petition process to get what they want
4127230 the senate is currently conducting an internal investigation in an attempt to discover who is behind this once we learn their identity that information will be turned over to law enforcement and we would expect it to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law
4127231 razvan este unul dintre acei putini profesionisti ambitiosi pe care orice manager si i doreste sa i aiba alaturi acum sase ani pe vremea cand altii nici nu si puneau problema dorinta noastra si visul lui a fost sa punem bazele celui mai bun departament de strategie si am reusit adunand in timp multe amintiri frumoase rezultate pentru clientii nostri precum si recunoastere in industrie local si international ii multumim pentru tot ce a facut in leo burnett pentru ca a contribuit la succesele agentiei si pentru dedicarea lui totala razvan pleaca dupa acesti ani lasand in urma cea mai puternica echipa de planning din romania
4127232 este momentul sa mi iau destinul in propriile maini si sa mi deschid propriul business le multumesc ioanei si lui stefan pentru increderea pe care mi au acordat o in toti acesti sase ani in care am dezvoltat impreuna primul departament de strategie al unei agentii din romania au fost niste ani frumosi plini de provocari si de succese am visat impreuna si am transformat multe vise in realitate o sa mi lipseasca multe lucruri dar cred ca in primul rand imi vor lipsi oamenii din leo in general si colegii mei din departament in principal sunt adevarati profesionisti alaturi de care am trecut prin multe provocari de business si de comunicare
4127233 atat elena cat si victor au deja experienta si maturitatea de a prelua sarcina de a duce mai departe ceea ce am inceput alaturi de razvan e un pas firesc daca ne uitam ca au contribuit deja major la proiecte si campanii mari care au obtinut rezultate foarte bune pentru branduri si recunoastere in industrie si suntem siguri ca impreuna vom reusi sa ducem leo burnett la nivelul urmator
4127234 cred in planning ul care genereaza idei si creatie pe masura nu doar in planning de amorul artei sau pentru ca a devenit cool
4127235 si cred intr un departament puternic de planning indiferent ca vorbim de advertising pr btl sau web iar cum gmp se dezvolta in spiritul comunicarii integrate imi doresc sa consolidam departamentul de planning si sa strang in jurul meu o echipa de oameni pasionati de ceea ce fac oameni care traiesc viseaza observa si proceseaza nu oameni care bifeaza inca o zi de lucru dar in traditia gmp prefer intai sa facem lucrurile si sa vorbim despre ele dupa aceea nu sa ne batem cu pumnul in piept inainte de a le face

4127245 everything in life can be nourishing everything can bless us but weve got to be there for the blessing to occur being present with quality is a decision we are invited to make each day
4127246 feeling grateful or appreciative of someone or something in your life actually attracts more of the things that you appreciate and value into your life
4127247 develop an attitude of gratitude say think you to everyone you meet for everything they do for you
4127248 sometimes our light goes out but is blown into flame by another human being each of us owes deepest thanks to those who have rekindled this light
4127249 gratitude unlocks the fullness of life it turns what we have into enough and more it turns denial into acceptance chaos to order confusion to clarity it can turn a meal into a feast a house into a home a stranger into a friend gratitude makes sense of our past brings peace for today and creates a vision for tomorrow

4127309 het lijkt erop dat jean marie dedecker de brusselse vlamingen als pasmunt wil gebruiken in de interinstitutionele dialoog en dit nog voor de onderhandelingen goed en wel zijn begonnen
4127310 ongevraagd en gratuit gooit dedecker het lot van de brusselse vlamingen te grabbel zon stellingname kan de franstaligen alleen maar aanmoedigen om hun onzinnige eisenbundel nog te vergroten zonder dat daar op het vlak van de staatshervorming iets tegenover staat

4127315 af te zien van handelingen die door de georgische leiding ge nterpreteerd kunnen worden als een aanmoediging van zijn wraakzuchtige ambities en die kunnen leiden tot een herhaling van het tragische scenario

4127341 i think it probably didnt pass this time because of the financial crunch that we were in and what it might take out of the revenue stream but i think it is a good idea and i think it will be back
4127342 rusland zal elke beslissing van het volk in zuid osseti en abchazi steunen
4127343 om nieuwe aanvallen van georgische zijde te verhinderen zal er een versterkt contingent van de russische vredestroepen in zuid osseti blijven
4127344 the ability to do a test from a spit rather than from a blood test really opens up this field to women who traditionally had not been eligible or had not had access to the services
4127345 when you have a child you want all the knowledge possible so that you can take whatever care you have to
4127346 a warning yeah i know what kind of warnings he gives but if you think its going to be easy youre dead wrong
4127347 i have no intention of leaving a mark on you
4127348 ill deal with my boss ive done it before as long as he gets his money hell be satisfied
4127349 youll take care of it man arent you a nice guy and exactly what do you want for it
4127350 people dont shell out twenty grand just to be nice
4127351 vixen sweet im not doing this to be nice quite frankly nice is something that eludes me so no im not doing it to be nice
4127352 that means you want something i bet i can guess what it is fuck that i aint a whore
4127353 if i thought you were we wouldnt be having this conversation
4127354 you mailed the product to the police and i imagine you told them where to find the rest of the product that counts as informing i believe but ive decided that doesnt suit you either neither does a whore so relax when we have sex it will be because we both want it not for any other reason
4127355 excuse me when we have sex what in the hell you mean by that
4127356 when vixen it isnt a question of if but of when it will happen
4127357 its going to happen i know it and soon youll know it too
4127358 so the other disciples told him we have seen the lord
4127359 there are so many other things jesus did if they were all written down each one of them one by one i cant imagine a world big enough to hold such a library of books
4127360 jesus knowing by now everything that was coming down on him went out and met them
4127361 im praying not only for them but also for those who will believe in me
4127362 i tell you the truth you will weep and mourn while the world rejoices you will grieve but your grief will turn to joy a woman giving birth to her child has pain because her time has come but when her baby is born she forgets the anguish because of her joy that a child is born into the world so with you now is your time of grief but i will see you again and you will rejoice and no one will take away your joy
4127363 i still have many things to tell you but you cant handle them now
4127364 you may or may not have thought of some of the things ill point out to you tonight but i hope i can share some things with you that will make the life and death of our savior a little bit more precious by the time he was crucified jesus had been up about thirty six hours without any sleep we know from biblical accounts that jesus was an early riser there are several places in the gospels where he arose early and went and prayed we have no reason to believe that he did anything other than that the day he had his last meal with his disciples he likely arose early that morning spent his day and subsequently had dinner with the disciples that night the last supper in the upper room he was then taken prisoner in the garden of gethsemane was led all about the old city of jerusalem and was tried at least twice the next day at about daybreak he was actually hung on the cross and hung there throughout that day between the time he arose and the time he actually died on the cross a period of about thirty six hours had passed with no sleep or rest something else you may not have thought of was how far jesus actually walked about the old city of jerusalem we know he was led about from the chief priests house to herods to pilots during the time that he was being tried and we know he was led all about the old city of jerusalem if you add it up he walked about two and one half miles that last night also as best we can ascertain from historical accounts jesus carried his cross about a third of a mile before he collapsed and wasnt able to carry it anymore these are some physical exertions that added up place stress on a person the next thing i want to talk about is a phenomenon called hemathidrosis hemathidrosis is a very rare medical phenomenon thats been reported about twelve to fourteen times in world medical literature and is only seen in people who are under tremendous stress and agony in hemathidrosis a person actually exudes blood from every sweat gland in their body each sweat gland has a small capillary that surrounds it and in hemathidrosis that small capillary ruptures as it bursts a person actually bleeds into their sweat glands instead of perspiring sweat if you will they actually perspire blood the bible gives an excellent description of this phenomenon saying that the lords sweat became as great drops of blood indeed every pore of jesus body oozed and drained blood now i believe that christ was a man just as much as any one of us but at the same time i believe that christ was god and knew the terrible fate that lay ahead of him he knew the job he had come to this earth to do the mission he had to fulfill and i believe the man part of christ dreaded this agonizing death and torture that lay a few hours ahead of him just as much as any one of us would we know he prayed in the garden of gethsemane saying father if it be your will let this cup pass from me but he submitted his will to his fathers there in the garden of gethsemane jesus was under about as much anxiety and physical stress from an emotional standpoint that a human could experience knowing that in a few hours he would be delivered into one of the most agonizing and brutal deaths ever recorded in history why didnt the lord bleed to death if he bled out of every sweat gland in his body if youve been to israel as i have you know that this time of year you have warm days and cool nights it was this cool night air that probably cause the lords damp skin covered with sweat and blood to chill causing the capillaries to constrict and stop the bleeding this same chilling in the cold night air has kept many a drunk and hoodlum who ive seen shot or stabbed and whos then lain in a ditch all night from dying it causes the blood vessels to constrict and causes the blood loss to be minimal but by the time jesus was taken by the soldiers from the garden of gethsemane he probably had a mixture of sweat and blood over his entire body surface i can imagine this was some sight to behold lets talk about the scourging scourging was such a horrible torture that roman citizens were forbade to be scourged only slaves and traders could be scourged it was one of the worst punishments the romans had to inflict on a human body typically the victim was stripped completely naked and tied by his wrists to a post or wall with his back exposed he was then whipped from the back of his arms down his shoulders and back across his bare buttocks down the back of his legs and calves all the way down to his heels by two roman legionnaires one on either side alternating blows the historical accounts tell us that the traditional scourging consisted of thirty nine lashes if you can imagine two large strong burly roman legionnaires someone that we would equate to say a pro football player today with a wooden handled whip about eighteen inches long that had nine leather thongs something akin to what we would call a cat o nine tails the nine leather thongs were about six to seven feet long and at the end of each thong was some lead shod like a sinker youd use to go fishing attached to the lead shod were pieces of sheep and cattle bone the idea of those small pieces of bone was that as the roman legionnaire would beat his victim snapping his wrist would cause the weight of the metal shod to dig into the back while the sheep cattle bone cut the skin as the sheep cattle bone lacerated the skin and actually dug in under the surface of the skin the skilled and trained legionnaire could whip his wrist and literally lift small shards of skeletal muscle out through the skin leaving small ribbons of muscle about two inches long hanging through the skin when i was working on this i looked at in the cadaver lab and did some dissection trying to figure out what one blow like this would mean to you and me as best i could tell and from some of the information i was able to gather from the shroud of turin exhibit one lash with this whip one thong would make a cut about two inches long and about three quarters to an inch deep to put that into medical terms thats a cut that takes about twenty stitches to close so with one lash one swing of the whip a total of nine lacerations could be inflicted on the victim each laceration two inches long and three quarters to one inch deep with one blow one roman legionnaire could inflict enough wounds to take one hundred eighty stitches to close if you multiply that times thirty nine those two roman legionnaires inflicted enough lacerations to take about 2 000 stitches to close ive seen people whove gone through the windshield of a car or wrecked a motorcycle into a barbed wire fence and ive still never seen anyone that tattered up in any of my medical experience this gives you an idea of the amount of the physical trauma that was inflicted upon jesus just from the scourging again youd ask why jesus didnt bleed to death and again you have to remember that this was done in the cold night air the very thing that caused his blood vessels and capillaries to constrict and actually cause the blood loss from this beating to be minimal as mentioned the idea of the lead weight was to lift the skeletal muscle out imagine having a cut on your skin with an inch of muscle pulled out through the cut exposed to the night air we see this sometimes in stab wounds or when people are stabbed with sharp objects like sticks and the muscles are pulled back through the skin the purpose this served in the scourging was that as the victim hung on the cross in the heat of the day birds could light on him and actually peck and pull at these pieces of muscle just like a robin trying to pull a worm out of the ground frequently how long a person actually survived on the cross during the crucifixion was determined by how severely he was scourged sometimes they would beat a man nearly to death before they put him on the cross and he would only live a few hours most of the time though the scourging was intended for public humiliation and embarrassment because it was such an inhumane method of torture another thing you may not have considered tv has done a real injustice to trauma depicting men in bar room fights who take blows to the face or head and jump up and beat up three or four men i can tell you that its really not that way in real life if i took any one of the men here tied his hands behind him and then let any other man of average size and build beat him in the face with his fists open and closed i cannot begin to tell you the amount of trauma this would inflict on him we know that jesus was beaten in the face and head as he was mocked i can assure you with all confidence that by the time the lord was crucified after his beatings its almost certain that both of his eyes were swollen shut and no doubt his nose was pouring blood i can also tell you that when people are struck in the mouth with a fist the first thing that happens is that the lower teeth come right through the lip ive taken care of many people in the emergency room whove come in beaten up in fights with their teeth sticking through their lips both upper and lower sides if jesus was tied and held and beaten in the face by these strong legionnaires i dont think theres any doubt that his lips were tattered like paper and some of his teeth were knocked loose or maybe even knocked out you might ask if his jaw bones were broken normally they would be but not in jesus case and ill tell you why in a few minutes during jesus trials and humiliation we also know that a crown of thorns was plaited and placed on his head in christs case this was done to mock him as being king of the jews some of you have been to israel and have seen these thorns theyre about an inch and one half to two inches long and theyre as sharp as an ice pick the custom was to take a small three or four foot long reed and slap the thorns on top of the head of the victim in order to drive the thorns into the skull those thorns laid upon someones head and then tapped down with a reed were hard enough to penetrate the outer table or the outer bone of the skull imagine the bleeding from three or four hundred puncture wounds in the scalp and around the forehead from these thorns so before jesus crucifixion ever begins his face has been beaten to a pulp no doubt his eyes were swollen shut his nose is bloodied and i remind you that every pore in his skin has wept and oozed blood every visible surface on the good lord jesus i am confident was covered and caked with dried blood and his back and his arms and his buttocks and the back of his legs were literally torn to shreds from the scourging this was the shape jesus was in before they ever gave him his cross to head out to calvary now one of the things i take issue with from agnostics who ive heard debate this i do not think the lord died from shock secondary to blood loss there is nothing that jesus said on the cross and nothing in the description of the crucifixion in any of the gospels that gives us any idea that jesus was in shock before he died how do i know that when someone is shot or hit by a car and comes to the emergency room theyre not sitting up talking to you their eyes are glassy their color is pale their blood pressure is about sixty over nothing and theyre barely conscious if conscious at all jesus never lost consciousness theres nothing in the description of his trials his scourging or his time on the cross that tells us he was incoherent mentally or lost consciousness something else physical stress everything the bible tells us about the life of jesus is that he was a healthy early thirties male who lived a rough life he didnt have a home he probably slept outside and he walked every where he went he was probably as we would say as tough as a pine knot i think jesus was a hardy young man very strong and stout physically and that there was nothing weak or puny about him from a medical standpoint prior to the crucifixion as far as emotional stress i dont think jesus had any kind of nervous breakdown he was certainly under stress in the garden of gethsemane but nothing that he said on the cross gave any indication whatsoever that he was decompensating mentally even during his gravest hours on the cross ive also heard cardiac arrhythmia debated as a cause of jesus death when people go into cardiac arrhythmia if its ventricular tachycardia or some of the other types of cardiac arrhythmias one of the first things that happens is that the heart even though it beats fast or funny doesnt function very well as a pump when it doesnt function well as a pump your blood pressure drops and you lose consciousness again nowhere in the gospels do we have an account where jesus ever lost consciousness until he died lets talk about the cross for just a minute we know from corinthian and roman history that the crosses were usually in two parts first the cross bar that from very good historical accounts can be estimated to have a weight of 125 to 150 pounds and to be about the size of a cross tie many of us have stacked or used cross ties at one time or another or have certainly seen what they look like on the railroad tracks i want to remind you that this was a rough unplaned unfinished piece of wood with splinters and spikes and rough places in it just like you would expect to see in a railroad cross tie when the victims final trial and condemnation had taken place to maximize the shame and suffering the custom was to tie the cross bar to the victim and have him carry it through the city from his point of condemnation to his point of execution part of the custom was that many times these people would be forced to stagger through the streets after being scourged and beaten with the cross bar tied to their arms and to add to the ultimate humiliation the victim had to bear the cross naked imagine how humiliating that would be in this day and time much less how humiliating and agonizing it must have been for jesus the other part of the cross was an upright part which is just like a post in the ground every major city at that time had an area outside their gates where they performed crucifixions it was really not only a form of execution but of entertainment as well many of the major cities had areas outside their walls where they would have three or four of these upright posts that were permanent fixtures someone condemned to crucifixion would bear the cross bar through the streets to the point of crucifixion and once there would be thrown onto the ground nails would then be driven through their hands into the cross bar then two forks something similar to pitch forks would be placed around each end of the cross bar and they would be boosted up and the cross bar hung on top of the upright post once they were braced on the upright post both feet would then be nailed to the foot piece the nail wounds the romans practiced crucifixion for hundreds of years and they perfected the art of pain and suffering how could a man have spikes driven through his hands and feet and not bleed to death the romans figured out that if they drove the spike through a mans wrist right at the middle they could avoid hitting any arteries or veins if you go back and look at the hebrew word for hand its inclusive from the fingertips to about where it crosses your wrist so the hand didnt necessarily mean the palm and i can tell you from having been a hand surgeon at one time and from dissecting cadavers to try to see if the muscle was strong enough to hold the body weight its not you can not drive a spike through a mans palm and hang him by it without it pulling right out between his fingers it is an accepted medical fact that the muscle in your palm is not strong enough to support your body weight in order to be able to drive spikes through the lords hands they had to drive them through at the wrists there theres a very strong ligament called the traverse carpal ligament thats strong enough to support the body weight the romans figured out that if they came about where the crease in the wrist is and drove the spike through this area they would miss the radial artery the artery people cut when they try to kill themselves by cutting their wrist right where the doctor takes your pulse and they would also miss what we call the ulnar artery over on the little finger side what they would do though is drive the nail right through the biggest nerve in the hand called the median nerve if any of yall have ever had carpal tunnel syndrome you know how uncomfortable any inflammation or irritation to that median nerve can be when the median nerve is transected it gives about the sensation of having an electric cattle prod stuck to your wrist and a constant electrical shock going through your hand and causes the fingers to claw in essence the romans devised a way they could drive a spike through a mans hand and not lose one drop of blood while maximizing the amount of pain and suffering that man would endure the romans did the same thing with the feet they calculated where they could drive a spike through both a mans feet and not cause blood loss that would cause the victim to bleed to death the spike would have been placed between the first and second metatarsal bones missing the dorals pedis artery there again they drove the spike through the feet with no blood loss the spike misses the artery but does hit the plantar nerves thereby causing that same horrible shock sensation lets talk now about jesus hanging on the cross when hanging by their arms as a crucifixion victims body weight sags down their diaphragm functions like a billows as the diaphragm drops into the abdomen it pulls in air so someone hanging on the cross had no difficulty whatsoever pulling air into their lungs the tough part for people hanging on the cross was breathing out in order for a crucifixion victim to exhale they would have to pull up against the spikes with their hands and push up against the spikes with their feet i want to remind you heres jesus hanging on the cross probably naked in front of the whole city of jerusalem ive already described his back to you every time he took a breath that tattered lacerated and riddled back was drug and scraped across the splinters and the rough knobs and spikes protruding from the cross each time he breathed out each time he uttered a word he would have to pull up with his arms and push up with his legs thats why i want to remind you just how precious jesus words from the cross were thats why he couldnt say more than three or four words at a time because when you talk you only talk as you breathe out not as you breathe in every word jesus spoke on the cross was spoken as he was pulling up against the nails and dragging his back across the cross thats why what the lord tells us what he spoke from the cross is very precious to me because i know what it cost him and how badly it hurt him every time i give this talk it reminds me how he died for us and just how every word hurt and how he suffered just to give us every word what did he say he said behold your son

4127367 i dont think it tells us very much more than wealthier people and higher social classes live in the south west and the south east though that doesnt detract from the achievements of students in these areas
4127368 there are also many more independent and selective schools in the southern part of the country and any additional improvement in selective schools is bound to be reflected in regional statistics

4127371 todays results for science and maths a levels give us reason to be encouraged
4127372 maths and further maths have continued their robust recovery with the numbers of students taking these a levels increasing for the fifth year in a row this is a welcome pay off for the serious efforts made in recent years to boost this subject

4127420 when you have this different surface the agriculture on the upland contributing more water to the valleys you have more floods and with those floods you have a lot more sediment in them
4127421 what youre left with now is a floodplain surface thats much further from the water table and its drier without the sedge meadow and wet prairie
4127422 if you reduce that land surface elevation you have more room for floods to spread out during a major flood event
4127423 that is helpful for not only reducing the flood peaks downstream youre reducing the energy of the flood by letting it spread out but youre also improving the connection between the channel and the flood plain that can have effects on water quality improvement

4127429 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
4127430 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies we are applying for eu us anti trust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any us or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity

4127604 we believe that the main function of the tree is to facilitate the flow of water from the ground and into the atmosphere
4127605 to achieve that function the tree is ideally designed to not only maximize the flow of water but in order to be successful in the real world it must also be able to withstand the stresses of the wind it is exquisitely designed to do just that
4127606 the tree is a physical flow architecture that has evolved to meet two main objectives maximum mechanical strength against wind and maximum access for water coming from the ground through the tree and into the atmosphere
4127607 in the larger sense the forest itself is a flow system with the same mechanical properties and functions as the individual tree facilitating the flow of water across the globe
4127608 winds come in many speeds but their ultimate effect is cutting off trunks branches and leaves so whatever is too long or sticks out too much is shaved off
4127609 so the pattern of the tree is the result of the never ending assault by the wind

4127681 it was the type of foreign policy rhetorical blunder that has regularly plagued the mccain campaign and could have diplomatic ripples as well certainly the comment was meant in innocence but for those predisposed to the notion that the u s is an increasingly arrogant international actor the suggestion by a presidential candidate that in this day and age countries dont invade one another when the u s is occupying two foreign nations does little to alleviate that negative perception

4127702 i thought it would just be a light drizzle and i could manage to move around with my umbrella however as i left from work it became dark and started raining very hard i was stranded at the bus stop with no autorickshaw in sight for a good one hour
4127703 there will be generally cloudy sky and rain and thundershowers in some places on friday
4127704 but the temperature has not been affected much the maximum temperature at 33 4 degrees celsius is just one degree below normal while the minimum at 26 1 degrees celsius is normal
4127705 i dont remember the last time it rained this much in delhi at 4 30 in the evening the skies turned black as if it were late night and the rain it was non stop causing the drains to overflow and jams created on the roads
4127706 whatever the problem whatever the cause whatever the reason there is no place for violence in our society there is no issue that does not lend itself to dialogue and reconciliation
4127707 the paths of peace and compromise can be complex and difficult but pursue them we must they alone will enable the nation to grow and prosper
4127708 i appeal that calm be always maintained in all parts of the country and wherever differences exist all efforts be directed towards reconciliation
4127709 are built with the contributions and hard work of one and all
4127710 on the other hand violence in any form undermines its progress

4127712 i have been talking to virender sehwag and gautam gambhir frequently in the nets and they have been very helpful to make me understand what went wrong in the test series they are specifically giving useful advice on how to face mendis

4127726 although i support sen obama i would never be dumb enough to offer policy advice to either candidate they seem to be doing fine without me
4127727 this post is not about weight or dieting its about becoming sane and normal because i honestly used to think that there was something terribly wrong with me i had this terrible shameful secret that was ruining my life and despite being good at most other things i just could not master this i was fat for 9 years and tried for 9 years unsucessfully to lose weight i joined several diet support groups i bought every diet on the market i even had therapy for compulsive eating when i think back i feel so sad for the person i used to be my whole life and every waking thought used to be consumed by food and bingeing i would have breakfast at home then again at work i would go out during my lunch hour to get 2 take aways one i would eat at the restaurant or walking back to work the other in front of my colleagues i would stop at a fast food chain on the way home and then have dinner with my boyfriend again later and in between i had a steady supply of snacks in my drawer at work small things that were easy to stuff into my mouth when nobody was looking and quick to swallow in case the phone should ring it was that calculated if i was planning a binge and a friend would show up unexpectedly i would feel irritated and nervous and i couldnt wait for them to leave so i could be alone with my food i want to cry when i think about that now and every day i hated myself more and more and got fatter and fatter i started atkins a little over a year ago and lost 50 pounds in 8 months and have kept it off since then it was that simple atkins is not just a diet for me it gave me my life back
4127728 some days it was a little and some days a lot
4127729 but over the christmas holidays she had homework to do every day i wasnt impressed
4127730 it would certainly look at some of the issues such as holiday time
4127731 kids are at school for 6 1 2 hours and some are on buses at 7 30 in the morning and get home from school at 4 30 or 5 thats a very long day and then they are supposed to do homework
4127732 we are trying to find a balance between allowing legitimate protest and maintaining public safety and minimising inconvenience to people who live or work in the affected area
4127733 we hope that people will abide by the law and enjoy the opportunity of voicing their opinions in safety

4127745 ah weve done that nothing new so no need to grow bigger and stronger
4127746 for some time relative calm was maintained in south ossetia
4127747 the war games included a us navy supercarrier battle group an us navy expeditionary carrier battle group a royal navy carrier battle group a french nuclear hunter killer submarine plus a large number of us navy cruisers destroyers and frigates playing the
4127748 a strategic diversion has been created for russia the south ossetia capital has been shelled and a large georgian tank force has been heading towards the border american marines a thousand of them have recently been in georgia training the georgian military forces russia has stated that it will not sit by and allow the georgians to attack south ossetia this could get bad and remember it is just a strategic diversion but one that could have horrific effects
4127749 cases of possible threats by russia directed at georgia with the intention of taking control over the baku ceyhan pipeline
4127750 russia actively tends to isolate the central asian region from direct access to world economy especially to energy supplies if georgia government is destabilized western access to baku caspian sea and further will be limited
4127751 ever since the continents started interacting politically some five hundred years ago eurasia has been the center of world power the key to controlling eurasia says brzezinski is controlling the central asian republics
4127752 brzezinski russias invasion of georgia is reminiscent of stalins attack on finland
4127753 the russians deliberately provoked the fighting in south ossetia and timed it for the olympics this is a long standing russian effort to get rid of president saakashvili
4127754 and i want to stress im not a warmonger and i dont want a new cold war any more than dimitri does the russians wish to re establish a historic area of hegemony that includes ukraine and it is no accident that the other former soviet republics are watching this and extraordinarily upset as putin progresses with an attempt to re create a kind of a hegemonic space
4127755 the unipolar world refers to a world in which there is one master one sovereign one center of authority one center of force one center of decision making at the end of the day this is pernicious not only for all those within this system but also for the sovereign itself because it destroys itself from within what is even more important is that the model itself is flawed because at its basis there is and can be no moral foundations for modern civilization
4127756 unilateral and frequently illegitimate actions have not resolved any problems moreover they have caused new human tragedies and created new centers of tension judge for yourselves wars as well as local and regional conflicts have not diminished more are dying than before significantly more significantly more today we are witnessing an almost uncontained hyper use of force military force in international relations force that is plunging the world into an abyss of permanent conflicts we are seeing a greater and greater disdain for the basic principles of international law and independent legal norms are as a matter of fact coming increasingly closer to one states legal system one state and of course first and foremost the united states has overstepped its national borders in every way this is visible in the economic political cultural and educational policies it imposes on other nations well who likes this who is happy about this in international relations we increasingly see the desire to resolve a given question according to so called issues of political expediency based on the current political climate and of course this is extremely dangerous it results in the fact that no one feels safe i want to emphasize this no one feels safe because no one can feel that international law is like a stone wall that will protect them of course such a policy stimulates an arms race i am convinced that we have reached that decisive moment when we must seriously think about the architecture of global security
4127757 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
4127758 the position of the russia side is not proceed beyond the peacekeeping zone but we have to respond to provocations
4127759 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4127760 we dont want them here what we need is friendship and good relations with the russian people
4127761 we let her stay here and now shes blaming everything on us
4127762 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
4127763 mommy is a great mommy and when i grow up i want to marry her

4127777 all the six who died and the two who became invalid had no family history of heart attacks or any pre history of heart ailments or paralysis they were all in their prime between 27 and 33 years and handled challenging projects at work in their respective companies they worked long and continuous hours the end struck them very suddenly and it looked as if their hearts refused to take any more stress
4127778 our study confirmed that the number of suicides divorces heart ailments bp and diabetes patients and mental depression are the highest in the banking industry the fancy salaries of professionals are no longer something to rejoice about
4127779 we found that the banking industry has simply no routine deadlines hang before them and every day they chase new problems during weekends more than 60 per cent of the vehicles are found parked in the office complexes there is no physical exercise and new food habits favoured by pizza culture fuel the problem cervical spondilitis and wrist problems due to uncomfortable handling of the computer mouse eye problems and discomfort in bowel movements are common the stress for couples where both are employed in the it industry is the worst the simple step of taking time off from work for three months allowed a banking couple wanting a child for years to conceive one

4127818 look i know how hard it is i have been there but i got through it and here is what god has been doing in and through my life since i got out of the hospital he can do the same for you
4127819 he is the source of every mercy and the god who comforts us he comforts us in all our troubles so that we can comfort others when others are troubled we will be able to give them the same comfort god has given us you can be sure that the more we suffer for christ the more god will shower us with his comfort through christ

4128121 the situation will remain the same as it has for all of our prime time broadcasts
4128122 the reason that were showing this in the normal prime time patterns on the west coast is because this is when the majority of people are available to watch

4128154 we have been conducting the hawk training course for our rookie pilots to transcend from sub sonic to super sonic frontline fighter aircraft since march with the first batch of eight ajts delivered by bae the induction of more hawks will enable us to train more pilots to the complexities of operational combat flying
4128155 the induction of hawks is based on the recommendation of the la fontaine committee which found the co relation between the pattern of our training and the aircraft accidents it had then 1982 recommended the acquisition of suitable operational transitional aircraft to bridge the performance gap of the pilots to fly the frontline fighter aircraft
4128156 the hawk meets our long standing desire to fill the gap in training our pilots for present and future needs it will go a long way in improving the quality of our pilots and prepare them well in the operation of the modern state of the art fighter induction we expect the hawk to smoothen the process of transition from a trainer aircraft to frontline fighter by providing the pilots with progressive increase in performance and execution of complex acts

4128188 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4128189 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4128190 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4128191 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4128192 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4128193 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4128194 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4128195 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do

4128197 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays

4128199 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4128200 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4128201 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education

4128203 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful

4128248 this whole thing unfolded about two weeks ago when these two boys came on a talk show here in the states and announced theyd found a bigfoot body
4128249 the commentator asked them if they could send someone to see the body and they said the only person we would allow to come down and verify the body is the real bigfoot hunter tom biscardi
4128250 they showed me the body they took me to the area where they found it it took a day and a half to get there
4128251 i got to be honest when i first saw it i hated to see it in that state it was in i wanted to capture one so the world could see it walking i guess this is the next best thing for the time being
4128252 we trekked in for a day a half what kind of lunatic would be out here in a monkey suit i saw the thing i touched it

4128254 well release the dna analysis and well have the body right next to the two boys then you can see its real that its not all bullshit
4128255 as long as his part time business doesnt affect his work ethic
4128256 his claims of finding bigfoot is entirely a different matter unfortunately thats spilling over into his police life and thats where we have concerns when he comes back from medical leave well have to sit down and address those issues

4128386 i need to emphasize that what we have done is only in mice we dont know what the implications are for humans but it does raise a red flag that this is something that should be considered
4128387 we took out a couple of ingredients and made a cream that turned out to be non tumorigenic
4128388 we really dont know what ingredients in these creams are doing that
4128389 there is a need to have the various companies test their creams to see whether or not there is a problem
4128390 i am sure there are creams on the market that do not have tumorigenic activities and some of them may have anti tumorigenic activity

4128392 when elderly people complain theyre tired most doctors say yeah well youre old they tell their patients that feeling listless is an expected part of aging but there are reasons people are tired and they need to be investigated for clinicians the message from our study is that a lack of energy is widespread in the elderly but its not normal
4128393 i believe anergia is the universal language by which the elderly talk about their health problems
4128394 instead of noting symptoms of pain or a depressed mood many older adults feel more comfortable telling their physicians that they are tired as health care providers we need to start learning how to further identify the underlying causes of this lack of vigor and address them

4128438 we feed them every couple of days a pink liquid with nutrients not too dissimilar to what the olympians might drink for energy it keeps the neurons alive and allows them to grow within twenty four hours they make connections within a week there is a brain like activity if you stimulate one electrode you get spontaneous firing we then use that basic operation by linking it up to the robot body
4128439 one of the things we could look to do is to put sound in and get sound out which essentially means communicating theres no reason why we cant do that and i see that as something what it will mean to the neuron culture by putting audio in and getting different audio out is that it would allow us to whistle to it and teach it in some way to respond back
4128440 simply from the habit of doing things repetitively the neuron connections strengthen and allow the robot to be able to do it more accurately in terms of teaching the cells to do more that is part of the research can we get it to improve by applying different voltage and chemicals and things
4128441 we are doing that now applying chemicals to part of the brain structure so that it stops growing and the neurons will die off and then see if the actions the robot has been doing are taken over so its like looking at what happens in a stroke
4128442 can the brain learn to do things it used to do how can it learn to do the things it used to do the key thing is as we understand things a bit more is to put it into different positions or a particular situation and teach it so that we can see how the memory of what to do in that situation is constructed in the brain by the connection
4128443 with much of the city at sea level and already in a swampy condition with a high water table the ground is poised to disappear from under the proud home of crockett and tubbs if the oceans begin to rise of course this is the sort of phenomenon that normally takes place after endless amounts of time everybody will get out but its possible that miami will be a future atlantis a legend beneath the sea

4128449 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4128450 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4128451 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

4128454 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4128455 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4128456 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4128457 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4128458 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4128475 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4128476 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

4128494 all i am trying to say is that i was raised with a wonderful family surrounding me of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
4128495 am vormittag schien sich die lage in gori wieder beruhigt zu haben nach der ffnung der stadt durch die russen schien die georgische polizei sowie einige soldaten das ruder wieder in die hand zu nehmen die bev lkerung wurde aufgefordert die stadt aufzur umen die gesch fte wieder zu er ffnen die stimmung war beinahe entspannt selbst die kinder spielten auf den stra en
4128496 gegen 13 uhr h rten wir dass die d rfer um gori wieder unter artilleriefeuer standen kurze zeit sp ter verschiedene reporterteams standen gerade auf dem marktplatz mit einheimischen zusammen forderte sie ein russischer general und ein georgischen minister auf unverz glich die stadt zu verlassen es war offensichtlich der georgische minister hatte nichts mehr zu sagen
4128497 insgesamt sieht es gut aus f r die deutsche wirtschaft
4128498 ich wei dass viele sich ber cindys neues schmuckst ck wundern sie hat eine leichte verstauchung weil ihr jemand bei der letzten veranstaltung zu stark die hand gesch ttelt hat
4128499 one of a number of mod initiatives to develop new defence technologies
4128500 the uk has a world class track record in scientific excellence and we want to draw on all the expertise that is out there from box room inventors to the largest defence firms
4128501 the competition has been designed to provide an accessible and fun event for participants but there is a very serious point to it that is that the threats faced by our armed forces are continually evolving and exploiting the latest technologies will help them stay safe and ahead of the opposition
4128502 i read the script and the very human story and the very core of this film spoke to me very clearly
4128503 this is a departure from the very big hollywood productions
4128504 in fact the process was quite sophisticated while the result was quite simple
4128505 it certainly beats the usual crisps and beer riders from other bands
4128506 if the girls are keen to fill out their figures this will have them piling on the pounds in no time
4128507 i think its a well made picture but while its funny in spots its very english i dont think its broadly commercial it feels like a film that deserves a spirited release but not a wide one joel has an 800 screen deal which well honour but we might not be willing to spend the marketing money he wants us to
4128508 if joel is thinking there is someone out there willing to spend twice as much money as were willing to im sure he will pursue that
4128509 joss and i had a conversation and he told me about the role and i was blown away that he was even calling
4128510 its neat to get to that point in your career where youve got people of that talent and that calibre in that position in the business calling you and saying look im a fan of yours its great its a really neat feeling
4128511 eva is desperately trying to get pregnant with husband tony parker
4128512 after they phone their doctor she promised me i will be the next call
4128513 gaby is having a very tough time being the mother of two overweight hyperactive children
4128514 if i had to go stub a select out for a table id be like wtf whoever created this app sucks they did not even create select procs for me
4128515 also not mention everyone on the team may not necessarily know understand how to do the codegen
4128516 i saw someone characterize our profits the other day in terms of 1 400 in profit per second well they also need to understand we paid 4 000 a second in taxes and we spent 15 000 a second in costs we spend 1 billion a day just running our business so this is a business where large numbers are just characteristic of it
4128517 it may seem surprising that oil and natural gas earnings are typically in line with the average of other major manufacturing industries
4128518 this fact is not well understood however in part because reports usually focus on only half the story the profits earned
4128519 do you understand and can you appreciate from your position with the escalation of the price of a gallon of gas why people are fed up angry indeed disgusted with the oil companies
4128520 well i can understand why people are very upset and why theyre very worried and concerned about their ability to deal with these high prices
4128521 in terms of where they should direct their anger i dont think its useful for me to comment on that although it does bother that much of that is directed at us
4128522 you and so many other people in the oil business have said look youve got to understand the markets drive the price
4128523 but is there nothing that exxonmobil can do to make gas more affordable for the average joe
4128524 there is no one solution to this theres an integrated set of solutions and you have to undertake them all
4128525 so when the whole debate focuses around we have to choose this one solution or that people are missing the point
4128526 its a huge problem but now at least we are covered by a programme that includes maintenance and restoration of what we already have its nearly as complicated and costly as building from scratch
4128527 many buildings are in a poor state of repair and the chances of having them repaired are low
4128528 this week they didnt come at all they said it was because there were no building materials
4128529 modern solidly built houses and apartment blocks for a number of families constructed in the past two decades to shacks improvised out of inappropriate materials like tin sheeting and wood planks
4128530 if housing is a difficult matter for havana residents imagine what its like for those who want to come and stay here
4128531 i had to leave my house because the roof was in danger of falling in on me
4128532 helt ot nkbart att n gon skulle vilja f rvara s dyr och beg rlig narkotika i en narkotikamissbrukares bostad utan att denne varit medveten om detta och givit sitt samtycke
4128533 somoza may be a son of a bitch but hes our son of a bitch
4128534 has shown a great effort in preparing educational materials and his research in the domain of comparative law that has opened a new chapter not only in our university but to our knowledge in this country
4128535 has no record of mr ali kordan receiving an honorary doctorate or any other degree from the university
4128536 the interior ministry does not have the right to threaten the media for questioning the authenticity of the claim
4128537 truth of such an important issue must be made clear
4128538 i am so grateful you chose us to possibly parent your child who i already love so much that i hurt but if you choose not to place him with us thats still ok and ill never forget you
4128539 weve already spent some 50 million buying back some 35 gigalitres from the system
4128540 we have today agreed that we will initiate 80 million of water buyback earmarked for south australia
4128541 we will also now conduct a queensland water tender from those who hold water entitlements in queensland
4128542 extending the existing commitment of 34 million to 40 million
4128543 the realism in the players movements in the wii format should be raising concerns about the impact of the game playing on the player
4128544 however there are other games in other formats that you can effectively get guns and other realistic weapons to use
4128545 pushes the envelope with its extreme content but takes a step away from the dark and serious nature of most mature games
4128546 we are sick of state government leaders not having any balls and standing up for victoria
4128547 the only one who has done it is jeff so lets rally to get him back
4128548 this is another classic example of ted over reaching and stirring up factional trouble where none existed
4128549 it annoys me ted is even thinking about this stuff when he should be focused on bringing down the brumby government
4128550 this is a problem across both factions so why is ted kicking it along
4128551 when you have kids it comes with its own set of barriers to keep you from training alarm bells ring quite strong in my head my mind is suddenly going straight to the thought of myself contracting the virus and wondering how i can stay out of the public for two weeks when i will be living in the athletes village and competing in 17 days
4128552 the appropriate role for the federal government is to move as quickly as it can to put in place the new industrial legislation and to urge all parties including telstra to live in the real world to recognise the fact that circumstances have changed and to act in good faith
4128553 were looking at people who have got severe psychological problems
4128554 theres research that people who inflict cruelty on animals then move on and become involved in violence against people
4128555 people like martin bryant the tasmanian mass killer and ted bundy the us serial killer had previous history of cruelty to animals
4128556 so you have to look at whoevers done this in the same vein that they have the propensity to move on and commit atrocious crimes against people as well
4128557 weve got horses cattle depending on the time of year we sometimes have alpacas sheep goats chooks
4128558 its quite a big area sort of interspersed among gum trees she and other staff at the school are clearly upset
4128559 these kids have been working with these animals over a period of time and they obviously have an attachment to them and its very very disappointing
4128560 it would have counted toward the students final marks but clearly therell be extenuating circumstances and the teachers will take that into account with the marking
4128561 we think the people responsible should come forward first because we have some pretty good information that will be followed
4128562 it appears many horse racing industry participants were not concerned with whether or not funds used to engage in betting were legitimately attained
4128563 participants typically took the position that persons subject to criminal charges and likely to be betting with illicitly attained funds were innocent until proven guilty and welcome to continue betting
4128564 the city of greensboro and the state of north carolina have been great partners to the volvo group for a number of years
4128565 mack looks forward to continuing that partnership and making a positive contribution to the areas economy and community

4128569 my 1 goal was met amp exceeded great advice cant wait to try it in the real world
4128570 content was excellent amp i can see myself applying it at work
4128571 accordingly a large number of persons associated with the racing industry including bookmakers trainers jockeys commission agents and racetrack identities have come to the attention of police as having improper associations with known criminals
4128572 i have been told and i accept that a body of intelligence has been obtained throughout the general course of purana investigations which impacts directly upon the integrity of the racing industry in this state
4128573 many of the bookmakers who engaged in betting activity with suspicious persons were motivated by the opportunity to make substantial profits in particular where the betting client was prepared to make extravagant bets yet appeared to have limited betting success
4128574 money laundering is probably the main type of offence we find in the racing industry
4128575 its really important for the industry to be clean and be perceived to be clean
4128576 mr hulls has been asleep at the wheel while the racing industry has been in crisis

4128578 in the past people have criticized biofuels for the potential problems with food prices and climate change
4128579 but for a multifaceted approach to energy and climate one might consider that a small but meaningful contribution to our energy future
4128580 but there are lots of ways to get energy out of plants and liquid transportation fuel may not be the most efficient one
4128581 if you take a ton of biomass and convert it to electricity you can drive your car farther on that electricity than if you make ethanol
4128582 the more progressive suppliers of health care products are developing alternatives to dehp and pvc
4128583 many of the viruses we see follow a similar format in which an email with an embedded website link in the message is changed from what the link displays another recent example was a spoofed cnn newsletter sent out by spammers in this case the content included current news stories with numerous links in the message the majority of the links were valid but there were some that were replaced with malicious links as soon as our technology started detecting these messages we implemented a filter to stop these elusive viruses and voila all of our 14 million business users were protected this network effect and rapid protection against these new tactics is why businesses are increasingly moving their email security into the cloud
4128584 we are actually reviewing iphones from a hsbc group perspective and when i say that i mean globally
4128585 a decision on a piece of hardware like that would potentially be deployed conservatively to 200 000 people
4128586 you know its a big decision especially when you have an existing fleet out there
4128587 but its definitely something we are considering from a hsbc group perspective
4128588 we always explore the potential application of new technologies and this is no different
4128589 no i dont i think the iphone would change some underlying infrastructure considerations from an enterprise perspective but apple have been pretty smart with the design
4128590 de meesten zetten mijn verzoek ergens ver weg onder hun bureau pas op het laatste moment komen ze in actie maar het ziet er goed uit
4128591 anouk is nog pending ik verwacht dat het wel goed komt ze zit bij een sympathieke platenmaatschappij bij editors verwacht ik ook geen problemen over underworld maak ik me meer zorgen ze willen op zich wel opgenomen worden maar ik weet niet of we met hun voorwaarden akkoord kunnen gaan ze willen de opnames zelf houden wij willen dat niet
4128592 tegenwoordig wil misschien wel de helft van de bands dat soms doet de tourmanager de keuring soms bands zelf het gaat ze vooral om het geluid meestal hebben ze haast en vinden ze het na twee nummers checken wel best maar soms zitten ze zo een half uur te kijken vooral kleine bands doen dat dat probeer ik wel te voorkomen want wij hebben ook haast je vraagt je af waarom steeds meer bands hun opname willen checken we doen dit per slot van rekening al vijftien jaar en het gaat bijna altijd goed ik herinner me wel een show van coldplay op pinkpop waar s nachts nog drie nummers opnieuw gemixt zijn omdat een gitaar niet goed afgesteld stond
4128593 extince wil niet met zijn hoofd op tv ook al komen er honderd visagisten zo is ons verteld platenmaatschappij universal doet erg zijn best maar extince is erg eigengereid en de sex pistols doen moeilijk die willen niet door een tv crew gefilmd worden maar de eerste twee nummers mogen wel door pers gefilmd worden dus jullie kunnen altijd nog met een camera vooraan gaan staan die band hult zich expres in een soort mist van onaantastbaarheid en onbenaderbaarheid bovendien willen ze een dvd uitbrengen dus hebben ze liever dat er nog niet te veel materiaal vrij komt ze moeten ergens hun pensioen van betalen

4128599 the first example ive seen where someone has used the bioinformatic tools and genome sequence information that is now available to quantitatively assess the conservation of these targets among phyla and takes the next step to follow up and test the hypothesis that conservation of molecular targets is associated with risk
4128600 most substances have the ability to interact with biological systems
4128601 to identify effects you need to select the test species carefully so that you dont get misled
4128602 there is no value in testing the effect of a receptor active substance on a species that doesnt have that receptor
4128603 extrapolate to thousands we cant test all species under various scenarios

4128617 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4128618 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
4128619 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that far moreso than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights pro you know a number of other issues
4128620 obviously we would look at the total picture the total character
4128621 his determination inspiration what hes doing you know you would put all the into that decision making
4128622 it incited a lot of attacks on him from ultranationalists who thought that by simply describing phelpss quest he was saying the u s was better than china
4128623 all indications are that the will of the west has been found wanting the bush administration has limited its reaction to a few statements of disapprobation while state department derriere coverers rush to assure the new york times that they counseled saakashvilli against any military action in south ossetia making it seem as if hes to blame for the russian invasion of his country

4128638 normalerweise gilt eine systemumstellung als horror szenario f r den hotelbetrieb und seine menschen im holiday inn jedoch gingen wir die sache anders an
4128639 wir haben uns mit einer genauen anforderungs und wunschliste auf die suche nach einem neuen hotelmanagementsystem gemacht uns war es sehr wichtig von der altbew hrten aber dennoch limitierten dos version auf ein modernes und flexibles windows basierendes system zu wechseln und ein leistungsstarkes hotelmanagementsystem zu finden das durch seinen integrativen aufbau berzeugt der gedanke dass alle mitarbeiter sowohl im front office als auch im bankett mit einer einzigen datenbank arbeiten in welcher s mtliche informationen und daten hinterlegt sind und miteinander verkn pft werden k nnen hat uns sehr gereizt ein weiteres ausschlaggebendes kriterium war eine zwei wege schnittstelle zwischen unserem pms und holidex plus dem crs central reservation system von holiday inn um den erheblichen zeitaufwand der manuellen eingabe von reservierungen ber die elektronischen buchungssysteme zu vermeiden
4128640 die k rzlich abgeschlossene systemumstellung im holiday inn in stuttgart auf opera war einzigartig
4128641 opera ist ein sehr machtvolles programm das viele m glichkeiten bietet unser hotel und den verkauf unseres hauses zu gestalten es war sehr hilfreich im vorfeld die optionen kennenzulernen und die konfiguration somit auf unsere bed rfnisse anzupassen im namen aller beteiligten darf ich sagen dass die systemumstellung durch die konstruktive und zielgerichtete zusammenarbeit der micros fidelio mitarbeiter mit der projektleitung den abteilungsleitern und dem ganzen team in unserem hause sehr gut und u erst zufriedenstellend gelungen ist wir versprechen uns von der umstellung umsatzsteigerungen mehr kundenzufriedenheit und die optimierung von arbeitsprozessen

4128652 we conclude that a bill of rights and freedoms should not include directly enforceable duties
4128653 we recommend for inclusion amongst others the right to trial by jury the right to administrative justice and international human rights as yet not incorporated into uk law
4128654 we believe that there is a strong case for detailed rights for children and we recommend that the public should be consulted about including specific rights for other vulnerable groups
4128655 rights such as the right to adequate healthcare to education and to protection against the worst extremes of poverty touch the substance of peoples everyday lives and would help to correct the popular misconception that human rights are a charter for criminals and terrorists
4128656 a great deal of our work in this parliament has concerned the vulnerable and the marginalised older people in healthcare asylum seekers adults with learning disabilities and children in secure training centres for example
4128657 we have often pointed out serious shortcomings in the protection of the human rights of these vulnerable and marginalised people
4128658 whilst not diminishing the obligation on parliament to legislate effectively and in compliance with human rights principles strengthening the legal protection for the rights of such people should in our view be one of the principal purposes of any new bill of rights
4128659 we want to see a bill of rights that would set the bar for the universal standards to which everyone is entitled and fills the gaps in the protection of more vulnerable people such as the elderly children or people with learning disabilities
4128660 it should not be some sort of charter for correct behaviour that would see rights as a reward for fulfilling social responsibilities rather it should be aspirational setting out a shared vision for the future of our society
4128661 a uk bill of rights and freedoms would be a constitutional landmark
4128662 it would provide a framework both for protecting the liberty of the individual against the intrusion of state power and for protecting the little person against powerful interests
4128663 we will be taking an immediate emergency appeal to the court of appeals on judge townsends order today releasing the mayor from the tether and allowing him to attend the democratic national convention

4128683 you know most people talk about who movie stars celebrities are hooking up with and yet here we are talking about these fictional characters in the same way

4128689 we trialled podcasting last year to engage with show fans and had an incredible response
4128690 our podcasts are content rich and entertaining rather than trying to directly sell tickets one email we sent out prior to the show with a podcast link last year received a 30 response rate all those who responded bought tickets the podcast series is fundamental to our campaign in the run up to the mph featuring top gear live show
4128691 we expect the show to experience an excellent upturn in ticket sales with each new podcast release the quality content and production will no doubt attract tens of thousands of listeners
4128692 when the show moves from london to birminghams nec we will be producing a one off podcast featuring live recorded content from earls court to give listeners a taste of whats coming
4128693 this production successfully demonstrates that podcasting is not a me too medium it really does create audience engagement sales and also offers businesses like clarion the opportunity to have the production funded by sponsorship revenues

4128707 the fed is still facing substantial inflation risk despite the start of what might be a correction in commodity prices
4128708 soaring prices are clearly draining household spending power in real terms
4128709 fed officials cannot ignore these price increases but they have time to wait it out
4128710 we have rising conviction that inflation readings for august and now even september will be more favorable thanks to the sustained trend in retail gasoline and natural gas prices
4128711 moreover many food basics are posting declines in the wholesale market a trend which will soften food price gains for consumers
4128712 final declaration of the yale common word conference july 2008
4128713 it seems that the implications of this verse were not realized or discussed
4128714 this is a step towards affirming that muhammad is a prophet and the quran a word of god
4128715 as christians we affirm that the promises of abraham are fulfilled in christ
4128716 no muslim or christian should tolerate the denigration or desecration of one anothers sacred symbols founding figures or places of worship
4128717 we raise these issues because of our concern for the biblical christian faith and for the implications of the common word process for christian minorities in muslim lands christian mission in muslim lands and converts from islam to christianity around the world
4128718 although we respect and love muslims christians cannot accept islam as an equal and valid revelation from god the denial of the deity of christ and his redemptive work as well as of the trinity will always stand in the way of interfaith dialogue and co operation
4128719 just as muslims cannot accept the christian denial of muhammads prophethood and the qurans status as the word of god so christians must take a clear stand on the central doctrines of their faith
4128720 fully affirm s and support s all endeavors to work for peace in this torn world

4128727 the colors of coke are so well know that it is fun to experiment with new colors and see these familiar images in a new way
4128728 i love to dig in to the rich dark color of the coke in the traditional bell shaped glass the light sparkles and shines with the reflections of the ice
4128729 the coke bottles lines and curves are fun to explore and throw color on the bottle is a piece of art itself so it is an easy subject

4128746 i expected her to shoot 580 plus she was under pressure and this is surely disappointing when you see her score against her ability
4128747 i played up to my potential today but dont want to think too much about this match the result is no longer important to me

4128756 ran past a vacant lot where a large party was going on and the officer heard people in the crowd say theyre chasing jamar
4128757 attempted to strangle the officer by choking him with his shirt collar
4128758 that officers who had been involved in a recent highly publicized incident that had been videotaped may also have been involved in this incident and im not sure frankly how something like that could have occurred

4128780 now this story is no matter of mere opinion there is no possibility that obama just has a different opinion on a controversial national issue than we do as daniel patrick moynihan once famously said one is entitled to his own opinion but not his own facts what we have here is obama simply telling a lie and knowingly doing so will the old media continue to cover up for him like they have done for the last four years

4128795 no es solamente un problema de salud sino que es un tema de educaci n ya que apunta a darle a las personas que padecen estas enfermedades oportunidades que no tienen
4128796 todos discriminamos y mucho a las personas que padecen obesidad y a las que padecen trastornos psicol gicos como la bulimia y la anorexia y es por lo tanto desde la educaci n desde donde tenemos que tener una respuesta fuerte comprometemos con esta ley al ministerio de educaci n a implementar pol ticas que sirvan para el esclarecimiento debemos dar pelea acompa ados por este y por todos los ministerios que tienen relaci n con el tema para luchar contra estas enfermedades que tanto da o le hacen a nuestra juventud

4128820 you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
4128821 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4128822 and also i feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together
4128823 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice
4128824 and i think ridge is a great example of that

4128874 competition for skilled labor is the overriding pressure driving organizations to invest in talent acquisition programs cited by 88 of all organizations that followed by a shortage of desired skills cited by 83 of all organizations
4128875 greater emphasis is being placed on enhancing a companys brand and reputation in the market on proactively searching for so called passive candidates and in marketing to younger workers through new means such as social networking sites on the internet
4128876 a successful talent acquisition program involves far more than deciding what skills and attributes are needed from candidates and finding new sources for them it also involves the ability to measure and assess how well new hires perform in their roles during the first year on the job
4128877 we welcomed the opportunity to be a part of another important project with aberdeen group the findings really show the importance of having a great talent acquisition program in finding and retaining the best and brightest talent

4128886 some brain regions are too strongly connected functionally in children with dyslexia when they are deciding which sounds go with which letters
4128887 we had hints in previous studies that the ability to decode novel words improves when a specific brain region in the right hemisphere decreases in activation
4128888 this study suggests the deactivation may result in a disconnection in time from the comparable region in the left hemisphere leading to improved reading
4128889 these results might mean that after special teaching the children with dyslexia activated letters in written words first and then switched to sounds in spoken words rather than simultaneously activating both letters and sounds
4128890 the over connection between the language conductor and working memory at the same time may be a signal that working memory is overtaxed when language processing is more efficient working memory does not have to work as hard
4128891 we have a set of alternative ways of spelling the same sounds but this is not taught explicitly the way phonics is often taught over focuses on single letters and not the letter groups that go with sounds as well teaching children with dyslexia to read requires a different approach one that stresses knowledge of spelling sound relationships with a twist that tweaks the letter and sound processes to get connected in time in the brain
4128892 we have shown that gains can maintain for up to two years with behavior measures but much research is needed before it can be demonstrated that functional brain connectivity can be maintained

4128894 its the first canadian standard that proposes voluntary requirements for a new class of vehicle
4128895 its intended to be used as a safer alternative to vehicles that arent classified as a school bus
4128896 this is a valuable alternative for provinces and school boards to consider using for the safe transportation particularly for school age children and we urge provinces and school boards to consider adopting them
4128897 i think the bigger schools can manage it but they might prefer to go to local rental companies
4128898 the city schools would have access to the rental companies that would have three or four vehicles any particular day for rural schools thats more difficult

4128914 for a samurai to be brave he must have a bit of black blood
4128915 and we can cross the whole of asia and find the negro again for when in far off japan the ancestors of the modern japanese were making their way northward against the ainu the aborigines of that country the leader of their armies was sakanouye tamuramaro a famous general and a negro
4128916 the probable number of negroes who reached the shores of asia my be estimated somewhat by the wide area over which they were found on that continent
4128917 he was an african warrior he was prominent during the rule of the japanese emperor kwammu who reigned from 782 806 a d
4128918 the fact remains that sakanouye tamuramaro was an african he was japanese he was a great fighting general he was a japanese shogun
4128919 word comes from the very word samuaru or better saburau which signifies to be on ones guard to guard it applied especially to the soldiers who were on guard at the imperial palace
4128920 in as sense the originator of what was subsequently to develop into the renowned samurai class he provided in his own person a worthy model for the professional warrior on which to fashion himself and his character in battle a veritable war god in peace the gentlest of manly gentlemen and the simplest and unassuming of men
4128921 was buried in the village of kurisu near kyoto and it is believed that it is his tomb which is known under the name of shogun zuka tamuramaro is the founder of the famous temple kiyomizu dera he is the ancestor of the tamura daimyo of mutsu

4128930 opinion is sharply divided on alan parkers comical depression era gangster musical in which all the adult roles are played by child actors i think its a real gem a project with dubious possibilities remember that midget musical western terror of tiny town that works much better than anyone could have expected in its re creation of a thirties genre film it is so much more imaginative than say movie movie it not only affectionately spoofs oldtime gangster films but also dissects them so that we can understand how they were able to draw us into their fantasy world for the first time we pay attention to minor characters to the rhythm of the dialogue and the accents and to the importance of period costuming props and sets the speakeasies back alleys seedy theaters boxing arenas by watching these kids we really consider what makes their adult characters tick these talented kids dont miss a beat children are known for their ability to mimic adults but these kids must mimic the way adult actors play cliche adult characters and the result is something entirely original people who dont like this film usually regard paul williams score the children lip synch songs which adults record as insipid i think he wrote a bunch of terrific infectious songs that fit well into the storyline and raise the pictures spirit level musical highlights include my name is tallulah fat sams grandslam speakeasy so you wanna be a boxer and you give a little love the dancing is also a lot of fun my only complaint is that the use of cream pies instead of bullets doesnt work ironically the pie hurling scenes are too vicious for me
4128931 bank repossessions or reos continued to be the fastest growing segment of foreclosure activity in july posting a 184 percent year over year increase compared to a 53 percent year over year increase in default notices and an 11 percent year over year increase in auction notices
4128932 the sharp rise in reos combined with slow sales has resulted in a bloated inventory of bank owned properties for sale realtytrac now has more than three quarters of a million properties in its active reo database a number that represents approximately 17 percent of the inventory of existing homes for sale reported in june by the national association of realtors

4128934 the nerve of you people to act so god damn smug
4128935 you know what if people have problems of a partisan nature they should not use the death of a firefighter or anything associated with a disaster to deal with it so shut up
4128936 ive been representing this community for 25 years i know when a person is using me and using the situation for partisan purposes
4128937 the majority of your constituents plan on attending mr disantos meeting
4128938 the majority of my constituents plan on attending my meeting which is the official city meeting
4128939 maria do you think its appropriate to ask residents who have gone through all this to shut up like you just did
4128940 he didnt go through anything a person should not use the death of a firefighter and this communitys tragic losses monetary everything else for partisan purposes yes but i have a history here and i know what im talking about ive been here 25 years
4128941 why would i it makes sense a thousand people fit there
4128942 i think thats an event i can do well in and probably who could stay up the longest
4128943 just so you know thats supposed to be funny even though i am serious

4128945 these results are the first to prospectively quantify changes in alcohol use in relation to recent combat deployments
4128946 the results suggest that efforts should be made to develop drugs that could be given in a controlled clinical or treatment environment in which addicts would have their most potent drug memories reactivated such treatments would be expected to diminish the effects of those memories in the future and help individuals resist relapse and maintain their abstinence
4128947 i couldnt have done this without the catholic churchs support as a spiritual community in my life
4128948 if i had two lists one list of good one list of bad i would have to put that on the good list
4128949 i bet they have a machine that can do them in birmingham
4128950 i am proud to announce this finding that will create history and will be of great use to the police around the world i am proud of my team of constables inspectors who volunteered as test subjects we gained valuable insights by playing music in police stations and observing the effects on test subjects we also found that when asked to dance they could only jiggle their bellies and perform the profane and vulgar belly dance i am extremely grateful to them for bravely allowing us to first test this highly risky theory on their ownselves this is an example of our concern for the public
4128951 this tells us that sleeps role in emotional memory preservation is more than just mechanistic
4128952 in order to preserve what it deems most important the brain makes a tradeoff strengthening the memorys emotional core and obscuring its neutral background
4128953 emotional memories usually contain highly charged elements for example the car that sideswiped us on the ride home along with other elements that are only tangentially related to the emotion such as the name of the street we were traveling on or what store wed just passed
4128954 we were interested in examining whether sleep would affect memory for all of these elements equally or whether sleep might allow some of the event features to decay at a faster rate than others
4128955 our results revealed that the study subjects who stayed awake all day largely forgot the entire negative scene they had seen with their memories of both the central objects and the backgrounds decaying at similar rates
4128956 after an evening of sleep the subjects remembered the emotional items smashed car as accurately as the subjects whose memories had been tested only 30 minutes after looking at the scenes
4128957 by contrast sleep did little to preserve memory for the backgrounds i e street scenes and so memory for those elements reached a comparably low level after a night of sleep as it did after a day spent awake
4128958 this is consistent with the possibility that the individual components of emotional memory become unbound during sleep

4128972 whilst operators understandably dont want to be perceived as trying to unfairly glean excess revenues from unwitting subscribers while abroad taking a one size fits all approach blocking their usage while abroad will result in them losing very significant revenues at a time when you would expect them to be looking to maximise their 3g network investments
4128973 operators need to take better control of their network assets so that they can offer a bespoke service to each user on a case by case basis
4128974 in a competitive european market where operators are increasingly trying to differentiate their service and the many millions of corporate subscribers are becoming increasingly international operators surely have no choice but to ensure they maximise all mobile broadband revenue opportunities whilst offering subscribers the best possible service
4128975 i think what theyre just doing is its part of a negotiation ploy
4128976 health care is a no brainer theres no question that theyre going to get health care they know theyre going to get their health care
4128977 i think the afscme leaders are doing their jobs theyre doing good negotiations theyre right to do that theyre like sports agents right and i feel like im jim hendry theyre just trying to cut the best possible deal for their ballplayer and theyre right to do that
4128978 so much of what the fight here in springfield is about is about jobs and health care and if we get the house democrats to support jobs and health care everybody in illinois would have health care and of course our public employees are going to have it
4128979 im saying everybody in illinois who works for illinois state government will have access to good quality comprehensive health care the way that we give ourselves health care
4128980 im hopeful i hope its not a cynical attempt just to run the clock out and im going to take him at his word he said today he announced before all the democratic county chairmen that his caucus has talked to him and they can support the use of an asset like the lottery to invest in infrastructure create jobs so i have no reason to think he wouldnt say that if he wasnt being truthful and sincere
4128981 this has nothing to do with my personality i have a job and its a job that pays well and provides a good quality of life im fighting hard to try to create jobs for the 464 000 men and women in illinois who dont have jobs and to stimulate our economy and keep those who want to raise our taxes from not raising taxes
4128982 any time you are relying on a single system to do a critical task you are vulnerable if that system has problems
4128983 it is our fault for not having a replacement for the shuttle much earlier than orion will be available it puts russia in a very powerful position
4128984 it is like a monopoly position where you are at the mercy of that supplier
4128985 you dont want to be dependent on a single provider no matter who it is
4128986 you are much more reluctant to be nasty with somebody who is a sole provider of an essential service
4128987 we have other international arrangements with them that could be jeopardized by our reliance on them
4128988 everything from their foreign relations with ex soviet states to their role in economic summits
4128989 while it is possible that government to government issues could potentially have an impact on other aspects of a relationship between nations including cooperative space exploration activities nasa has no reason to believe that it will be unable to rely upon roscosmos provided soyuz vehicles for future iss activities
4128990 if our relationship with russia is strained who knows if russia will give us rides in the future
4128991 or if they give us rides will they charge such an exorbitant price that it becomes blackmail

4129011 there always used to be a particular city that was the centre of cool at a particular point in time
4129012 but now theres no longer a place where its at theres no longer any centre of the worlds popular cultural universe for a time it seemed it would be a simple matter of shifting from london to tokyo but instead street style is everywhere and in places youd never have guessed it would be

4129016 american apparel and uniqlo are doing what vice did which is to stop using expensive models and photoshop they use point and shoot photography which is more honest and exciting cheap digital cameras and the internet popularised that
4129017 theyre now transmitted laterally and collaboratively via the internet you once had a series of gatekeepers in the adoption of a trend the innovator the early adopter the late adopter the early mainstream the late mainstream and finally the conservative but now it goes straight from the innovator to the mainstream

4129019 even if were writing about a band we try to put some social context in it were the economist meets rolling stone but back when rolling stone was good
4129020 in 2008 the only prevailing trend is that there are no prevailing trends
4129021 its not just designers who are contributing to the end of boldface trends consumers too are rejecting the commandments of the editorial elite taking inspiration from peers around the world to craft their own interpretations of style rather than buy into one trend from head to toe like the preppy or punk movements of decades past consumers are appropriating eclectic influences and remixing them like a dj does with music
4129022 its pick and mix its retroactive and its nostalgic so you get a chronological misfit of products and references mashed together to create something completely different think about nu rave its a product of eighties romanticism a product of punk a product of straight edge and of old rave the growth in cool hunting websites and businesses has led to the decay of the traditional time scheme between an emerging group doing something and it being spotted embraced and codified it used to be a year then it was six months now its about six days we have 3 500 trend spotters stationed around the world i sit down with them four times a year and well find that the same trend has cropped up in about 25 different cities

4129032 ive gotten a lot of questions the last few weeks asking if obama is the antichrist
4129033 i tell everyone that i dont think the antichrist will come out of politics especially american politics
4129034 i can see by the language he uses why people think he could be the antichrist
4129035 but from my reading of scripture he doesnt meet the criteria there is no indication in the bible that the antichrist will be an american
4129036 ive gotten a lot of questions the last few weeks asking if obama is the antichrist
4129037 i tell everyone that i dont think the antichrist will come out of politics especially american politics

4129084 thats a big one also a couple of 6 7 amp 8 pounders amp some sea bass to 4 5 pounds
4129085 wir wollen mit dem gleichen mut wie im fr hjahr auftreten und gewinnen
4129086 draw near to god and he will draw near to you
4129087 und nat rlich will ich gold gewinnen f r mich w re der olympiasieg so wichtig wie ein wimbledontitel
4129088 these offences occurred at st pius x high school in adamstown the charlestown parish and taree parish
4129089 police will also be reliant upon evidence of similar facts pertaining to offences committed at waverley college by a further complainant
4129090 we want to see peoples rights in the workplace respected and that includes of course if they have chosen to join a union having the union able to represent them
4129091 were now talking to our staff about collective agreements things that will benefit them that will make sure that theyve got the best terms and conditions
4129092 das ist sehr schade denn jefferson war sehr gut drauf wie man im spiel gegen madrid sehen konnte aber ich habe volles vertrauen in die st rke unseres kaders
4129093 if they havent got anyone with enough guts im prepared to risk myself to do it
4129094 hendra virus is going to come back again and again and again because it comes from bats and theres millions of bats and theyre a protected species we need to know a lot more about it
4129095 it was overturned on the basis not enough is known about the virus to be sure the horse will not pose a threat to human health quite simply its just not worth the risk
4129096 we care about our students and want to do everything we can to have a safe and healthy school year
4129097 our idea is that taking care of personal safety isnt something to just to think about at nighttime or bar time but to make a part of your life all of the time
4129098 im eager to welcome students on moving day and make sure they take advantage of all the resources both the city and the university provide for them to stay safe and have a great year here in madison
4129099 from a student perspective our campus blends with the city and the city blends with the campus
4129100 security concerns exist in both environments and it is important to work in partnership to emphasize awareness
4129101 weve offered to build a second terminal in stansted in the past and double the traffic suffolk homes
4129102 niche modeling is a quick and straightforward approach to addressing problems that molecular data will eventually solve
4129103 also testing niche models in the present and past is the first step in making predictions about where species will move in the future given global warming scenarios
4129104 these findings may suggest a new approach to treating serious strep infections by supporting our bodys natural defense system
4129105 lacking this single protease the mutant strep strain was easily killed by human neutrophils
4129106 in addition the mutant strep bacteria no longer produced a spreading infection when injected into the skin of experimental mice
4129107 in addition to attempting to kill the bacteria directly with standard antibiotics new treatment strategies could be targeted to inhibit the strep protease and thereby disarm the pathogen making it susceptible to clearance by our normal immune defenses
4129108 this tells us that sleeps role in emotional memory preservation is more than just mechanistic
4129109 in order to preserve what it deems most important the brain makes a tradeoff strengthening the memorys emotional core and obscuring its neutral background
4129110 emotional memories usually contain highly charged elements for example the car that sideswiped us on the ride home along with other elements that are only tangentially related to the emotion such as the name of the street we were traveling on or what store wed just passed
4129111 we were interested in examining whether sleep would affect memory for all of these elements equally or whether sleep might allow some of the event features to decay at a faster rate than others
4129112 our results revealed that the study subjects who stayed awake all day largely forgot the entire negative scene they had seen with their memories of both the central objects and the backgrounds decaying at similar rates
4129113 after an evening of sleep the subjects remembered the emotional items smashed car as accurately as the subjects whose memories had been tested only 30 minutes after looking at the scenes
4129114 by contrast sleep did little to preserve memory for the backgrounds i e street scenes and so memory for those elements reached a comparably low level after a night of sleep as it did after a day spent awake
4129115 this is consistent with the possibility that the individual components of emotional memory become unbound during sleep
4129116 you might say that sleep is actually working at night to decide what memories to hold on to and what to let go of
4129117 spacecraft instrumentation cannot perform critical measurements such as precise radiometric age dating sophisticated stable isotopic analyses and definitive life detection assays
4129118 the papers in this collection complement each other to give a fairly comprehensive view of the achievements and issues in this area
4129119 we believe that the main function of the tree is to facilitate the flow of water from the ground and into the atmosphere
4129120 to achieve that function the tree is ideally designed to not only maximize the flow of water but in order to be successful in the real world it must also be able to withstand the stresses of the wind it is exquisitely designed to do just that
4129121 the tree is a physical flow architecture that has evolved to meet two main objectives maximum mechanical strength against wind and maximum access for water coming from the ground through the tree and into the atmosphere
4129122 in the larger sense the forest itself is a flow system with the same mechanical properties and functions as the individual tree facilitating the flow of water across the globe
4129123 winds come in many speeds but their ultimate effect is cutting off trunks branches and leaves so whatever is too long or sticks out too much is shaved off
4129124 so the pattern of the tree is the result of the never ending assault by the wind
4129125 although it is an old scientific chestnut we must once again emphasize how important it is to support continuing basic science on tropical forests
4129126 there is a great deal of excitement in the quantum condensed matter community about the iron pnictides
4129127 for more than 20 years our perspective was limited to cuprates and it is hoped that this new class of materials will help us understand the mechanism for high temperature superconductivity
4129128 these low cost amplifying devices can look tempting to individuals with hearing impairment because of the significant cost differences
4129129 but our research found that the low cost aids generally dont meet the fitting requirements to help a hearing impaired person and could potentially damage a persons hearing
4129130 aside from being of extremely poor quality very low cost hearing aids those under 100 have the potential to damage your hearing because they send very loud sounds into the ear the studys mid range hearing aids 100 500 were of higher quality and were not considered a safety hazard
4129131 based on the research the best advice for consumers is to talk to an audiologist because hearing aids have complex technical features they need to be fitted and customized to the individual
4129132 currently more than 32 million people have a hearing impairment yet only about 25 percent of those use hearing aids
4129133 meanwhile the aging population is growing and hearing loss becomes more common as we become older
4129134 our findings suggest that many former child soldiers may need more than interventions to reduce the mental health problems associated with surviving bombings and torture often they have to endure being stigmatized when they return to their home villages
4129135 these findings suggest that there is something else in addition to war trauma that is causing problems for the former child soldiers
4129136 one hypothesis is that the reintegration process puts added stress on them
4129137 our amnesia about what is natural is the greatest threat to the environment
4129138 some may say that it is irresponsible to make such predictions pending further detailed study to be sure of every point however we will never be certain about every detail and it would be irresponsible to remain silent in the face of what we already know
4129139 lack of political will and the greed of special interests
4129140 simply enforcing the standards of the magnuson stevens act and the u s national marine fisheries service would result in major improvements in u s waters within a decade
4129141 globally xdr tb has resulted from a combination of poor tb control practices poor adherence to medications inappropriate use of second line drugs lack of laboratory capacity to culture tb or assess drug susceptibility and high hiv prevalence
4129142 in order to prevent an escalation in xdr tb we need to ensure adherence to the cornerstones of tb management which include directly observed therapy isolation of infectious cases and contact investigations we also need to institute routine rapid and standardized methods to assess drug susceptibility of tb isolates
4129143 animal studies have indicated for years that msg might be associated with weight gain
4129144 ours is the first study to show a link between msg use and weight in humans
4129145 we found that prevalence of overweight was significantly higher in msg users than in non users
4129146 we saw this risk even when we controlled for physical activity total calorie intake and other possible explanations for the difference in body mass the positive associations between msg intake and overweight were consistent with data from animal studies
4129147 the u s food and drug administration and other health organizations around the world have concluded that msg is safe
4129148 the ocean community is on the threshold of a new era in which an ensemble of novel technologies will provide us with an increasingly powerful capacity for exploring and interacting with the global ocean system
4129149 the cruise itself is an example of the coming generation of systems where highly capable autonomous underwater vehicles like sentry will be integral components todays auvs are helping us develop the power and high speed communications network well need to explore powerful and potentially dangerous processes at underwater volcanoes within powerful tsunamis or in the wake of large storms and hurricanes
4129150 seeing the first maps pop up on our screen was a real thrill for us they represent the results of hard work by all members of our team
4129151 most developed nations have major research efforts focused on understanding and learning to use these energy rich deposits of methane
4129152 our plan is to build the infrastructure that will allow entire generations of scientists to study these deposits firsthand using robotic telepresence no other country is there yet
4129153 there was some interest in converting syngas into ethanol during the first oil crisis back in the 70s
4129154 the problem was that catalysis technology at that time didnt allow selectivity in the byproducts they could produce ethanol but youd also get methane aldehydes and a number of other undesirable products
4129155 if we can increase this activated co adsorption on the surface of the catalyst it improves the opportunity for the formation of ethanol molecules
4129156 and if we can increase the amount of surface area for the catalyst we can increase the amount of ethanol produced
4129157 gasification to ethanol has received increasing attention as an attractive approach to reaching the federal renewable fuel standard of 36 billion gallons of biofuel
4129158 the great thing about using syngas to produce ethanol is that it expands the kinds of materials that can be converted into fuels
4129159 you can use the waste product from the distilling process or any number of other sources of biomass such as switchgrass or wood pulp basically any carbon based material can be converted into syngas and once we have syngas we can turn that into ethanol
4129160 people have discovered high levels of repeated sequences in the genomes of most higher species and spun theories about why there are so many repeats
4129161 we have been able to show with yeast that these repeated sequences allow the formation of new types of chromosomes chromosome aberrations and represent one important way of diversifying the genome
4129162 those particular differences may prove to be more successful in natural selection and eventually you may get a new species
4129163 if you have a break in this repeated part you can repair not only from the same chromosome but also from a similar repeated sequence in many other places in the genome
4129164 we expected to see primarily single base pair changes or small deletions and insertions no one expected to see that one person would have two copies of a gene while others would have one or three copies of the same gene
4129165 in our study carotid endarterectomy achieved low rates of post surgical mortality and morbidity and translated into long term freedom from stroke in high risk patients despite their poor health
4129166 the presence of multiple medical comorbidities is not sufficient to automatically rule out this treatment which has demonstrated long term efficacy in preventing stroke in medically high risk patients
4129167 the dna is released out of the cell in less than a second
4129168 we dont know how eosinophils are capable of catapulting mitochondrial dna so quickly
4129169 on every issue important to fire fighters senator obama is and has been in our corner
4129170 we cant overlook senator mccains service to our country but we also cant overlook his poor record on issues critical to the financial security of our 290 000 members
4129171 nach dem bisherigen erkenntnisstand sind vermutlich alle an der auseinandersetzung beteiligten personen identifiziert
4129172 i already own three and now im here to buy for my japanese friend
4129173 basically we are simplifying and coalescing our efforts around atom as the single brand for internet devices
4129174 and most importantly for licenses such as the gpl it means that your rights to use the copyrighted work at all disappear
4129175 the lack of money changing hands in open source licensing should not be presumed to mean that there is no economic consideration
4129176 for example program creators may generate market share for their programs by providing certain components free of charge
4129177 attractiveness of free software and open source distribution models for both software developers and it vendors
4129178 the court of appeals for the federal circuit has agreed with the basic legal theory upon which we have relied for years
4129179 for the community this wasnt about money at all but about receiving the blessing of an important court that the foundations upon which the entire free and open source and creative commons philosophies are based
4129180 its the prelims nothing really counts until the finals i just want to set myself up well for the final and take it from there
4129181 its a great time i definitely didnt expect to go that fast
4129182 it felt pretty easy and i made mistakes on my turn and my finish could i improve that time certainly if i fix those things i didnt really push it i didnt want to fight it
4129183 its important to get in the final i dont care where its just my goal to win a medal i was definitely surprised by the time
4129184 the use of the r word perpetuates the dehumanizing and negative stereotypes of people with intellectual disabilities
4129185 seventeen times the word retard is used in taunting and humorous ways
4129186 we think this film depicts people with intellectual disabilities in ways that are embarrassing and ultimately unfair
4129187 a lot of kids do use it and it the film probably would make them use it more
4129188 an action comedy about a group of self absorbed actors set out to make the most expensive war film but after ballooning costs force the studio to cancel the movie the frustrated director refuses to stop shooting leading his cast into the jungles of southeast asia where they encounter real bad guys
4129189 lessons learned from the past research in extreme environments training conditioning and countermeasures for psychological stress are some of the things nasa is in the process of addressing for the upcoming age of exploration
4129190 behavioral health problems can interfere with the success of the mission especially on long duration space flights like missions to the international space station the moon and mars these self guided software tools will provide private and immediate access to treatments even though the patient may be many miles from earth
4129191 for example they emphasized the importance of regular communication regarding work publicity and education all of which provide connection to earth and helped to reduce the perception of isolation
4129192 the closest analogue to mars exploration is the exploration of earth
4129193 both maritime and terrestrial explorers struck off into the unknown often for many years at a time
4129194 preparing for the psychological stress of long duration space missions
4129195 five years ago you couldnt sell green it wasnt sexy it wasnt a granite countertop
4129196 luke is a quality back rower and has played in the nrl for many years so will be bringing plenty of experience to the team next year
4129197 there is a real buzz hopefully the fans will soon start to get excited
4129198 so far only 10 police investigators have been redeployed of this figure one is a legal officer and another a transport officer beside the 10 police officers other policemen affected are those who keep guards at the commission and have nothing absolutely to do with cases
4129199 to defray the attack on his convoy by gunmen on the opposition
4129200 might have been a failed insider job to eliminate deputy governor chris akomas to realise the long nurtured plot to pave way for mr mascot kalu current chief of staff to governor orji and former governor orji kalus brother into the position
4129201 so why would anyone aim to assassinate an empty car how come there were no casualties
4129202 since we are the only party he took to the appeal court where he is challenging our historic victory at the tribunal we take it that the statement is referring to us which is truly unfortunate because abians are too intelligent to fall for this cock and bull assassination dummy which is reminiscent of the orji uzor kalu days of crying wolf to divert attention
4129203 the governors hysterical reaction is typical of his desperation since the tribunal nullified his election and declared the pdp candidate winner the governors fairytale raises more questions than answers why were they carrying n2 billion inside the bullet proof suvs allegedly taken away by the so called robbers why were they carrying n2 billion to port harcourt where the court of appeal sits governor orji has always used the owerri airport on his domestic trips so why switch to port harcourt airport on this day let him explain
4129204 i dont know how the governor imagined that anybody would kill him when he was not there
4129205 you cannot shave my head in my absence anybody who can plan assassination would have known that he wasnt even in the vehicle so why launch an attack when the man was not there but we do know of internal wrangling in their party they believe that there would be another election in abia and they are therefore trying to position
4129206 the game plan is eliminate the deputy governor and get in their candidate as the deputy governor before the ruling by the appeal court and then ppa progressive peoples alliance will tell t
4129207 the drama of opponents attacking him is to divert attention by accusing the opposition
4129208 actually we are compiling the list of all the people who died either tragically or in mysterious circumstances and these include a deputy governor commissioners special advisers ssg et al and it will amaze nigerians that all these took place without anyone raising an alarm
4129209 because the information about the movement of cash is believed to have leaked from his office
4129210 exposing the lies and manipulation of public sentiment by the state governor who had blamed the shooting on his political opponents
4129211 it is now clear that governor theodore orji spoke first before getting his facts right his comments then blaming the shooting on the opposition were meant to procure public sympathy for a dying regime now the facts are out and the chickens have come home to roost
4129212 we must first analyse his comments from the standpoint of his desperation and his unfortunate lack of control of the political situation in which he finds himself
4129213 we had been wary that this would occur due to excellent growing weather
4129214 with lower corn prices expected some u s farmers may be enticed to plant more soybeans in 2009 which require less fertilizer due to higher relative margins over corn
4129215 one catalyst to start a rebound could be an early frost
4129216 however downside risks still remain in the near term as further crop upgrades are possible given our near perfect growing weather now and positive crop weather outlook see above through august
4129217 the white population is older and very much centered around the aging baby boomers who are well past their high fertility years
4129218 the future of america is epitomized by the young people today they are basically the melting pot we are going to see in the future

4129228 that painting your mother bought us i hung it up on that wall what do you think
4129229 i am studying for my gmat the picture looks fine please dont bother me again unless its important
4129230 its the darn picture you know if you didnt like it you could have just said something ill move it its not a big deal
4129231 of course i love you what kind of a question is that
4129232 no do you really love me or are you just comfortable
4129233 i love you but im tired of dicking around i feel trapped i need to leave but its not because i dont love you i need to leave because if i dont leave now i never will and im only 24 dont you feel like we havent done shit with our lives all i know of the whole world is that shitty college and you i have to do more with my youth i know we have been happy but i suddenly feel like im settling not that im settling for you youre great but i feel like im settling on this life because some gatsbyesque american dream bullshit i have to get out dont you get it i m leaving you and i have to do it right now
4129234 all i need is a few things i can come back for the rest when she is not around
4129235 what do you want from me if you are looking for me to try and stop you you can just forget it you obviously made your decision without even thinking of me
4129236 get out and dont you dare come back when you realize that you have made a mistake dont even think about trying to come back to me good luck finding someone else to put up with your garbage
4129237 but the reality is i dont believe were at the bottom of this economic downturn were just going to have to work through it and work through it together
4129238 our cuts may not be felt directly in the classroom but the department is getting leaner and we wont be able to do as much
4129239 oh the new harry potter huh that should be o k but dammit now im in the mood for mystery science theater
4129240 the biggest challenge for open source or any other kind of software development for that matter is finding the right information to solve a problem
4129241 adding automatic hardware tagging to our search data not only improves the relevance of our support but also gives it developers the most reliable information faster and with the analytical tools to make the right decision based on their exact environment no phone calls into support no trouble tickets just search on your desktop

4129245 gloomier than others about the country with fewer than one in eight saying the u s is heading in the right direction they also are likelier to be white and male and to consider themselves moderates and independents than those firmly committed to candidates
4129246 the underlying problem is not that our professors are feckless or that our undergraduates are brain dead addicts of ipods and cellphones who lack curiosity and passion for knowledge he writes
4129247 the real problem is that these young men and women through no fault of their own are showing up on campuses undereducated and unprepared for college level work they should have received a good general education before they arrived on campus
4129248 after that i just loved it so much that i went into it in high school and outside of high school
4129249 you get a lot more self esteem for yourself at least i did
4129250 it gave me the courage to get up in front of people and not be so worried about what they were thinking
4129251 personally it helped if you were angry at something and if you went into play practice you could take out that anger in a constructive way
4129252 it doesnt really matter who you are but what you get across and how you get it across
4129253 the first time that i did take part i didnt feel pressured or anything i didnt have that whole school situation where if i had started there i would be worried about peer pressure or whether or not im good
4129254 a lost boy wearing a redshirt with a white shorts
4129255 i dont understand why families that have a challenged child who becomes loud and abusive remain at a service where all participants are quiet and contemplative most of the time
4129256 ill tell you what autism is in 99 percent of the cases its a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out
4129257 some of these stories really are the ones where the general public can absolutely identify with the other side of the story
4129258 i certainly sympathize with all the families who are in this situation
4129259 but when we got away from the concept of institutionalization in america we lost an important element of trying to maintain civility there is a place for mental institutions
4129260 if it were up to me he would be in an institution my brother doesnt agree and thats his prerogative
4129261 autism may frighten people because so little is known about the disorder
4129262 the cause has not been scientifically proven and the victims often act in ways society doesnt understand
4129263 im an advocate for my child but we all have to play on the same playground
4129264 its not about clearing the playground so my child can be on it
4129265 certainly there are cranky people in this world if a mother glares at your child for something thats really pretty harmless quite honestly thats her problem
4129266 but if your child is going to have a meltdown i dont think its in anybodys best interest to bring the child along
4129267 but i would disagree with anybody who thinks they did that casually or it wasnt important to them
4129268 i have to be careful because sometimes hell do a fast movement or run
4129269 but the other members arent as scared as i am

4129283 look sms is great in that it connects so many people around the world but the fees associated with it are an absolute joke its a very small amount of data yet carriers seem to think its okay to charge an arm and a leg for it
4129284 i found reading the comments on the talks as interesting as the talks themselves
4129285 you teach me how to play golf jimmy and ill teach you how to play football
4129286 i was at home resting before an evening derby with hearts when i got a call from eddie turnbull
4129287 eddie had jock with him and he came on and said would you like to join my team i said yes and travelled to parkhead that night i found out later that celtic had tried to buy me a few times
4129288 it was so loud you needed volume control but i was proud of it
4129289 all i could think was please dont make a mistake but the game ended 2 2 and it was a great experience
4129290 i slid into a tackle which people who remember me as a player will find hard to believe
4129291 my boot came off and i was still holding it when peter grant passed to me and graeme souness went to win the ball
4129292 graeme was a magnificent player but he didnt like getting beaten in the heat of the moment you go for the ball and if you mistime it then it looks bad and he was full value for that ordering off some celtic fans were more chuffed that souness was sent off than the fact we won which tells you everything about the rivalry
4129293 everyone is force fed the daily old firm diet and i still get a tingle when these games come round even though im not involved now
4129294 if youre unlucky enough to be on the heavy end of a defeat and i was in the celtic side beaten 5 1 at ibrox in august 1988 you just go home and shut the door for a week well apart from frank mcavennie but he operated under different rules from the rest of us conversely an old firm win is great for the winners confidence and rangers will believe they still have a chance in the league if they win this one which is why it is so important
4129295 the new rangers manager is just like tommy its a transitional time for his club and hes had to build a new team
4129296 the job changes everyone who does it at celtic and rangers if you take all the criticism personally then youre not able to function paul le guen is a proven manager ive been impressed with the way he conducts himself hes an intelligent measured individual and it doesnt look as if he gets caught up in the madness but im sure hes still found it a culture shock becoming part of the old firm
4129297 nobody could have envisaged celtic being where they are now in such a short space of time it showed great strength of character on his part to overcome all the early criticism
4129298 the automatic stay which is essentially a federal injunction which prohibits collection efforts while the case is pending descends like an iron curtain and operates as an absolute bar to further collection activities
4129299 if the matter has been placed for collection the attorney or agency should be notified immediately by telephone with a follow up copy of the bankruptcy notice
4129300 the claims bar date is particularly important as failure to file a claim with the appropriate bankruptcy court in a timely fashion likely eliminates any chance of recovery
4129301 the name and address of the trustee and of the bankruptcy court should be on the initial notice although the trustee cannot give legal advice they can in many cases answer routine questions related to the status of the case asset recovery and important deadlines claims forms can be obtained from the court
4129302 men make decisions that result in their making more money on the other hand women make decisions that earn them better lives e g more family and friend time

4129304 i know of a number of companies who thought they were managing employees effectively yet for one reason or another failed to resolve an employee problem before it went outside
4129305 when attorneys became involved they were glad that they had the insurance to protect them
4129306 epli should not be viewed as a panacea against employee lawsuits
4129307 this insurance should be purchased in conjunction with the development of sound personnel policies and procedures it is intended to provide a safety net that mitigates risk for employers who have effective employee policies and practices ingrained in their company culture over time epli does little to protect bad employers from bad management practices

4129309 peaches is expecting fireworks although she knows her dad will respect her wishes
4129310 peaches was ashamed of the overdose and worried shed end up like amy winehouse
4129311 she and faris had started regularly using drugs and she realised it was becoming a problem so when she met max again who is a nice boy and a harvard graduate she thought being alongside him would steer her life on a different path
4129312 he was the nicest boy she could find quickly enough and was the key to her escaping the drugs that have been bringing her down only peaches would go so far as to think a wedding would be the best way to go about this though

4129314 organizations must maintain the trust of their customers employees suppliers and communities if they hope to succeed
4129315 and to do that they must ensure the integrity of their products services and relationships
4129316 the history of business shows that its highly unlikely that you can be successful long term without integrity
4129317 and if youre looking at the long term you cant survive without the trust of other people
4129318 integrity goes beyond a belief in moral principles to guide all aspects of personal and organization performance
4129319 while we all believe in doing the right thing our perceptions of what the right thing is can differ between individuals
4129320 a statement clearly sets the standard and then communicates that standard internally to employees and externally to customers
4129321 i ask people to distinguish between mistakes of the head and mistakes of the heart
4129322 is this a mistake of the head meaning that my heart was in the right place but i just didnt think about what i was doing or is it a mistake of the heart which means my heart was not in the right place and i knew i was intentionally being dishonest or violating the companys values or being unethical
4129323 a mistake of the heart means you probably dont want that person around
4129324 if its a mistake of the head you want to talk about it and learn from it
4129325 take responsibility then immediately put a plan in place to correct the situation

4129332 police booked his ticket from ho chi minh city to london and i have already paid for the ticket on his behalf
4129333 there is no god but wayne gretzky and mark messier is his wingman
4129334 why should we give you more money when what we already gave you has produced more harm than help to those it was intended to serve
4129335 im reminded that the actions of those in power have enormous consequences a price that they themselves almost never have to pay
4129336 the actions of those in power have enormous consequences a price that they themselves almost never have to pay
4129337 a broad multiclass multiracial movement is converging around obamas hope change and unity campaign because they see in it the thrilling opportunity to end 30 years of ultra right rule and move our nation forward with a broadly progressive agenda
4129338 pick the target freeze it personalize it and polarize it
4129339 if you push a negative hard enough and deep enough it will break through into its counter side
4129340 a tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag
4129341 most people who serve in washington have been trained either as lawyers or as political operatives professions that tend to place a premium on winning arguments rather than solving problems
4129342 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
4129343 a sudden and drastic reduction in the availability of credit
4129344 the distance travelled from the place where food is produced to the place where it is eaten considered in terms of the environmental damage that transporting it entails

4129347 the impact of human activity measured in terms of the amount of carbon dioxide it causes to be emitted into the atmosphere
4129348 the temporary failure of an item of clothing to do its job in covering a part of the body that it would be advisable to keep covered
4129349 as far as airline business is concerned the best business decision due to increasing fuel prices is to buy efficient aircraft for every route that we fly like those that we have
4129350 that is why for short routes like entebbe uganda nairobi kenya and bujumbura burundi we will be looking at fuel efficient aircraft like atr 42 atr 47 and crj which is what we are flying now
4129351 the two aircraft we are flying right now are some of the most fuel efficient in the market the crj is the most fuel efficient because of its size the dash 8 200q as well as atr have propeller engines that are very efficient and very good for short routes
4129352 our routes are performing well particularly the entebbe and nairobi routes we are getting full loads of passengers
4129353 the eyes are the first thing that you have to destroy because they have seen too many bad things
4129354 we come to you to describe our serious issues with glenn tiltons management
4129355 they are in fact your issues too and only together can we overcome them through the resignation or removal of glenn tilton

4129360 i see absolutely no reason for that and its silly
4129361 two judges have already found hes violated conditions of his bond
4129362 this is the first time a judge has stood up for him
4129363 ive said all along this has got to be resolved
4129364 this has been very very difficult for the city and for the state and its obvious why we need a resolution
4129365 the issue of race is there in political campaigns and not just this one people talk in code it is the 800 pound gorilla in the room that is ignored by mutual agreement so it never gets dealt with head on
4129366 thirty years is pretty good and the show is still very popular
4129367 clearly more americans chose to stay close to home in june than in previous years
4129368 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
4129369 i think people have started to take the increase in gas prices somewhat more in stride
4129370 more americans age 50 plus are trying to leave their cars behind but face obstacles as soon as they walk out the door climb on their bikes or head for the bus
4129371 so many people are being hurt by these high gas prices and it just caught america by surprise they just werent ready for these adjustments that need to be made
4129372 there is at least one silver lining in whats otherwise fairly painful news and that is that less driving means less air pollution and fewer global warming emissions
4129373 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4129374 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4129375 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4129376 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4129377 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4129378 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4129379 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4129380 im not ashamed of my behavior im not backing down
4129381 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4129382 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4129383 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4129384 hey lindsay what do you have to say about people commenting on your sisters implants
4129385 did you really just ask me that she is a 14 year old girl and you are a pedophile
4129386 we have to stop spamming people and make sure that companies and products are easy and a joy to discover thats no easy feat further it means giving up control however in a google age where self discovery rules its becoming a must
4129387 were counting on dev to come in and kind of take up a little bit of the slack of what we lost with joe alexander
4129388 were not foolish enough to think hes going to come in and take up where joe left off because joe was pretty good at the end of the year and he had such great strength i think as devin gets stronger hes the same kind of guy he can play inside and he can play outside he scores over smaller guys and can take big guys off the bounce like joe did so well do a lot of the same things for dev that we did with joe
4129389 i dont know he could be one and done ive never been able to work him out so i dont know
4129390 then and from a distance i admired very much the way she handled a uniquely difficult situation with uncomplaining grace
4129391 no one could be a bigger more condescending prick who abuses the power of his office than bill thomas

4129394 how do you try and revive a career that only you want revived well in hollywood this year you can either get pregnant or do what this c list film b list television actress that i love to hate is going to do become a lesbian yes you heard it here first this actress is going to loudly dump her boyfriend and start dating a woman simply for the publicity forget about the days of hiding the fact you are gay this actress has it all lined up instead of paying someone to be a beard for you this actress is going to take some of her fast dwindling cash and pay someone to be her lesbian lover
4129395 i honestly didnt believe it the first time i heard this about a month ago but when i heard it again yesterday i started to believe this actress is c list used to be on a hit network television show now she does films definite b list name recognition long term boyfriend who everyone assumed she was bearding for true who the hell knows but this is where it gets even more interesting despite the fact that she is one of the most desired women in hollywood and radiates sex it turns out that our actress is actually a virgin going to remain one until she is married which is why she actually enjoyed bearding guess her relationship prior to that was all about fighting the guy off
4129396 its much better than some of his other books like model behavior
4129397 we shouldnt judge no one is perfect who are we to point fingers
4129398 for pre order during the next few weeks ill give a few sneak peeks at its contents in my column
4129399 good morals precede good laws which is why government isnt much help
4129400 i will never deal with money accts business deals anything like that ever again
4129401 i do not think this is a time to be holding onto foreclosed properties hoping for a better day
4129402 could start to stabilize as early as the first quarter of next year if the government program gains any traction
4129403 por meio de um efeito direto no c rebro ou ao oferecer uma desculpa conveniente para esse tipo de comportamento
4129404 our goal was to investigate the relationships among drinking aggression and mood
4129405 what we found in the very high odds of sexual and physical aggression on heavy drinking days indicates major consequences of binge drinking for women that no research study had previously established
4129406 these findings provide support for the need to develop intervention programs targeted to this problem
4129407 in addition they help define characteristics that put women at increased risk for aggression regardless of alcohol consumption
4129408 women who enter college with a history of experiencing aggression or a history of heavy drinking are at greater risk for later aggression as are women who experience depression or anxiety while in college
4129409 they have intrusive recollections i keep remembering it i have nightmares about it i cant escape it
4129410 its not like you live at fort hood or camp lejeune and everybody on your street is in the military
4129411 we need to be cautious with what were allowing someone to do and at what point in their recovery theyre allowed to do it
4129412 to keep the brain stimulated but not enough to push it into overdrive
4129413 whether its pop warner football or soccer or high school teams
4129414 its difficult for them to realize this one game friday night is not as important as my cognitive ability the rest of my life
4129415 a major concern is that this particular virus also infects humans
4129416 it doesnt transmit from horses to people but could be transmitted to people by the mosquito bite
4129417 they decide to wait until later in the summer to vaccinate or not vaccinate at all because they dont think its a problem and thats when we start seeing it again
4129418 its very easy usually you just pinch the skin stick it in
4129419 for me spending hundred dollars a year to vaccinate is nothing compared to losing an animal that could be worth not only part of your family but 3 000 10 000 to 15 000
4129420 i think im pretty fine ive had a couple of club games with sydney university and i played a bit of time in the last two tests against the all blacks im ready to go
4129421 as a lineout caller you always take an extra little bit of responsibility and maybe some of the calls i made probably werent up to scratch
4129422 as a collective group we let ourselves down a little bit but theres no need to re invent the wheel we back our system and we back what weve got in place
4129423 theres no need to cry over spilt milk we had a bad night at the office and if that requires the caller to take responsibility then im happy to do that but we will bounce back and we will bounce back well
4129424 i suppose i might get a chance in the future with rocky elsom going overseas
4129425 because i didnt make it then doesnt mean i cant make it in the future i guess ive just got to find out why that is and change it
4129426 the joint business agreement will enable the airlines to reduce costs and attract new customers helping to mitigate pressure on fares from record fuel costs
4129427 this means that the airlines will have greater ability to invest in their products services and fleets employees and shareholders will also benefit from the agreement
4129428 there is no reason why fares should rise if this agreement is approved
4129429 make no mistake if this monster monopoly is approved it will be third time unlucky for consumers
4129430 it will still be bad for passengers bad for competition and bad for the uk and us aviation industry
4129431 under the joint business agreement the three airlines will cooperate commercially on flights between the united states mexico and canada and the european union switzerland and norway while continuing to operate as separate legal entities
4129432 warmly welcomed and strongly supports the application for anti trust immunity
4129433 anti trust immunity between oneworlds transatlantic partners would enable them to unlock even more of oneworlds potential enabling us to operate under the same rules as our alliance competitors
4129434 expand customer choice by supporting routes that would not be economically viable for the individual airlines
4129435 you will soon want us to approve other laws that entail an encroachment on privacy and im not sure well be able to
4129436 i view with great gravity the fact that the police overstepped their authority
4129437 soon you the police will ask us to approve laws that have similar ramifications regarding invasion of privacy such as the biometric information procedure and i am not sure that we will be able to do so
4129438 the prestige of the knesset members who supported the 2007 law and understood its importance is now hanging in the balance
4129439 i am concerned at the use you are making with the authority you have received we have convened to approve the regulations regarding the storing of the data never imagining that we would encounter such grave failures so quickly
4129440 the kibbutz also employ arabs but they all have work permits and someone armed accompanies them all the time they are here
4129441 but its hard to find jewish workers for the jobs we have available we also have to stay on good terms with the three arab villages nearby some of whose residents have been working here for many years arabs work in the entire etzion area in kitchens offices stores groceries on construction sites just about everywhere
4129442 we worry about each and every one of them but try to keep things in proportion i am extremely strict about sticking to the quota of palestinian workers i allow so that at some point it pays for employers to look for jewish workers
4129443 employing palestinians until one day i just decided to do without them
4129444 it bothered me i felt that as jews we have to take care of our own people i began to establish a new business and hired jews only ive been running my garage for years and it costs me at least double to employ jews but there is no comparison when it comes to loyalty level of professionalism and the atmosphere in the workplace
4129445 decided to ignore the dozens of girls in his way and galloped towards them needlessly and without any provocation on their part without any effort to go around them he did not even slow his pace
4129446 and in that state she continued to be trampled by four or five additional riders who galloped over her body while she was helpless to defend herself it will be noted that not a single rider assisted or offered first aid to the plaintiff
4129447 did nothing to prevent the attack and the damages incurred
4129448 a key position for competing in similar projects in the future
4129449 it is to the benefit of the state of israel to have leadership from a centrist public minded political movement
4129450 one that knows how to combine different outlooks that are in the zionist and nationalist consensus and that shakes off extremism i believe that foreign minister livni well expresses this idea in her public experience her values and her calm and broad vision
4129451 most appropriate choice to connect and join various elements in israeli society
4129452 i entered politics because i liked the approach that combines the right wing with the center but unfortunately right after the disengagement from gush katif and northern shomron there was a social crisis and then with the continued firing at sderot and environs my innocence was shattered i now think that in light of all this we must be very cautious about any future withdrawal decisions
4129453 this can mean only one of three things its name or purpose or articles of association are being changed
4129454 once again serial law violators appear to be rewarded peace nows activity has always served to fan tensions in israel and between israel and its allies
4129455 we are saddled with the painful but important task of completing the implementation of the international court of justices judgment by handing the bakassi peninsula to cameroon
4129456 and also i feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together
4129457 you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily would rule tom ridge out
4129458 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice
4129459 i dont think we are going to re ignite the cold war
4129460 president bushs decision to send aid to the people of georgia and americans stand united in support of the men and women who will carry out this humanitarian mission
4129461 must back up its commitment to stop its violence and violation of georgias sovereignty with actions not just words
4129462 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4129463 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4129464 gigantic experiment with nature and the whole of humanity that has gone seriously wrong
4129465 why else do you think we are facing all these challenges climate change and everything
4129466 the classic way of ensuring that there is no food in the future
4129467 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest environmental disaster of all time
4129468 he seems to be ranting about gm crops urbanisation globalisation and even hybrid plants he is inflating fears instead of contributing to reasoned debate
4129469 gm crops are not to blame for climate change the industrialisation of agriculture the spread of dysfunctional conurbations the salinisation of australia or indeed any of the other crimes of which the prince appears to accuse them
4129470 prince charles has hit the nail on the head about the damaging false solution that gm crops present gm crops will not solve the food crisis and forging ahead with an industrialised farming system will continue to fail people and the environment around the world
4129471 the prince is an organic farmer and its in his interest that organic farming works
4129472 there are millions of other farmers whose role is producing high quality affordable food and they need all the tools that are available of which gm is one
4129473 while i admire prince charless commitment to environmental causes his lack of scientific understanding and his willingness to condemn millions of people to starvation in areas like sub saharan africa is absolutely bewildering
4129474 the joint business agreement will enable the airlines to reduce costs and attract new customers helping to mitigate pressure on fares from record fuel costs
4129475 this means that the airlines will have greater ability to invest in their products services and fleets employees and shareholders will also benefit from the agreement
4129476 there is no reason why fares should rise if this agreement is approved
4129477 make no mistake if this monster monopoly is approved it will be third time unlucky for consumers

4129479 under the joint business agreement the three airlines will cooperate commercially on flights between the united states and norway while continuing to operate as separate legal entities
4129480 warmly welcomed and strongly supports the application for anti trust immunity
4129481 anti trust immunity between oneworlds transatlantic partners would enable them to unlock even more of oneworlds potential enabling us to operate under the same rules as our alliance competitors
4129482 but we gave it everything and im proud of what we have achieved its been an honour to play with nathan and an honour to be an olympian and to be here at the olympics
4129483 its bloody annoying to lose in the quarter final but it was a tough draw anyway we knew if we got through the first match that they the south koreans are a fantastic pair
4129484 thats shocking the academic debate is between some who say that junior enlisted ranks lean slightly republican and some who say its about equal but no one would point to six to one
4129485 that represents a tremendous shift from 2000 when the military vote almost certainly was decisive in florida and elsewhere and leaned heavily towards the republicans
4129486 if on a bad day a guy gets that letter that says his tour has been extended from 12 to 15 months that could spur a quick donation and expression of anger
4129487 donating helps members of the military express their political views privately
4129488 its hard to describe how apolitical a lot of the enlisted ranks are hes worried about other things than following the news
4129489 one possibly mundane explanation for the tilt in contributions from deployed soldiers is that the obama campaign has just been so much savvier with web based donors it may be a logistical question
4129490 it took some effort to get that check i had my mom send me my checkbook and i walked to the post office in camp liberty in baghdad with an envelope addressed to barack obama in chicago illinois
4129491 he was right on iraq long when others were jumping into the sea like lemmings and thats hard to do were soldiers and we respect courage
4129492 most of my friends are conservative republicans and they say im voting for barack mccain does not have a lock on the military vote thats for sure
4129493 well complete our duty im deploying next year because its a commitment i made to the nation not to a president but we all know that iraq was a big mistake
4129494 as soon as the surge was ordered my tour was extended just by a pronouncement from the president for very few americans can the president say something and your lives are changed
4129495 we have not in fact decided to pull out of afghanistan
4129496 we have temporarily and indefinitely suspended operations there foremost out of respect and sheer grief for the families and also obviously to protect the security of our remaining staff and to reassess what we might be able to do going forward
4129497 our staff currently are safe as safe as they can be and we are talking to communities government officials others on how we might be able to go forward but we have made no decisions now
4129498 right now we offer our deepest condolences truly i dont have words to express our grief at the loss to these families
4129499 they do need security and unfortunately its a fact of life and those that arent providing security for their workers theyre paying the price now
4129500 she was incredibly motivated she really cared about the children in the world who cant get an education because of conflict
4129501 we believed it was risky but the risks were managed
4129502 what was it you said again about that thing i should do
4129503 herrero rovira y paul flores eran presidentes de dos compa as de inversiones y alegadamente desfalcaron a unos inversionistas por aproximadamente 300 000
4129504 kim and i are so excited for this new chapter in our lives
4129505 we are due late march and cant wait to meet our little blessing
4129506 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
4129507 faculty includes such distinguished speakers as al aghili managed methods alan chhabra egenera andi mann enterprise management associates andrew conte apc andy astor enterprisedb ariel cohen xsigo systems bill oconnell ibm bill scarborough vmware bob lozano appistry bob quinn 3leaf systems brian martin ibm brian stevens red hat carlo innocenti ph
4129508 we have anticipated these flaws in dns for many years and we have basically engineered around them
4129509 i see a few other workers from other companies down by the river escaping too but generally it is very peaceful
4129510 we watch the herons buzzards red kites weasels mice and otters occasionally and it brings me back to reality and allows me breathing space with those that appreciate me not for targets savings volumes scrap reduction and product quality but just for being with them enjoying life
4129511 i do a bit of reading while i have my meal im currently having a go at the origin of species by charles darwin not the most relaxing read i normally read something a bit less heavy like the mammoth hunters by jean m auel which was my last cafe book
4129512 overall the walk and the meal with a good book gets me out the office it helps me switch off for an hour and the change of scenery is welcome
4129513 id feel the day was much longer if i just popped to the shop for a sandwich and came back to eat at my desk like some people in the office do plus i get some fresh air all in all its much more preferable to a deskbound lunch hour
4129514 the japanese lunches are prepared by the school by a local food centre or restaurant small teams of students take turns to serve lunch to their classmates
4129515 school lunches contain a rich variety of healthy and nutritious foods and students look forward to lunchtime
4129516 japanese people love their curry and rice my predecessor is from london and claims that japanese curry is not curry nothing beats a good british curry
4129517 work in this area is still immature and in the meantime enterprises should be aware of what is happening in the world of consumer social networking and implement appropriate usage policies for employees use of services such as facebook and myspace on company time
4129518 the whole thing was going to be determined at this sadc summit
4129519 we were all scheduled to go and meet with the troika the sadc organ on politics and defence were not going anymore
4129520 it was the south africans who invited us and paid for the tickets
4129521 there is disagreement on one element over which morgan tsvangirai had asked for time to reflect
4129522 we have adjourned to give morgan tsvangirai more time to consider these matters

4129525 my family has encouraged me to retire so they can watch something other than channel 3 on tuesday nights

4129533 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns
4129534 in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services
4129535 just because life is tough out there you shouldnt rid yourself of competition
4129536 i think canadian blood services is the right agency to really absorb this national thing we do need a national agency one way or the other
4129537 it may not be perfect but if you look at the face of it it certainly expands your pools of potential donors and thats extremely important
4129538 talking beats not talking lets put it this way and were looking at the integrity of these databases and thats extremely important we like to think people have a very common concern with lack of organ donation in this country and we can do something about it if we put our minds and hearts into it

4129545 but we do know for very accomplished very practiced individuals that high pressure situations are a very bad time for them to start thinking about their actions
4129546 the balance beam is a ridiculously hard activity i dont even know if i could walk on one but the big question for these athletes is why do they slip on actions they have performed flawlessly thousands of times in the past
4129547 the very best athletes put themselves in a bubble just focus on the moment and let their bodies do what theyve trained to do without letting their minds get in the way
4129548 at the very top level thats the difference between the winners and the also rans

4129581 in this case it was determined that we need to move forward in a timely fashion
4129582 this 11th hour ruling from the bush administration is highly problematic after over 30 years of successfully protecting our nations most endangered wildlife like the bald eagle we should be looking for ways to improve it not weaken it

4129590 he is passionate about it and looking forward to the games in 2012
4129591 if his calendar works out he will be able to go from the l a galaxy game to beijing
4129592 it also depends on if he gets picked for the next england game as he can go on from there

4129605 macforce has been a great partner for softpress and im sure this will be a fantastic day for everyone
4129606 it was great working with the chinese delegation the chinese people are very hard workers and we as south africans can learn so much from them
4129607 we were excited to have been affiliated with a multi national brand like tiens
4129608 our strategic media solutions has proven successful thus it has placed tiens southern africa in a favourable light and set them on a good footing in south africa
4129609 we are proud to have opened our first banner store in africa and to be the pioneers of this new retail concept on the continent
4129610 the most striking thing about california is that if you look at it on almost any indicator its economy population its positioning in world trade its one of the largest countries in the world
4129611 and its more important that we have gay marriage in california than having gay marriage in any other country in the world quite bluntly
4129612 the minute that the court decision legalizing same sex marriage broke we started talking about what we could do to help
4129613 this really is the central core fight for the gay community right now
4129614 another thing about california is that it has hollywood and silicon valley and there are not many states that have the resources economic and cultural that california does
4129615 california has led the nation in many ways and this is again an instance where theyre out front on an important issue
4129616 i never believed this day would be possible in my wildest dreams and now that it has come and gone it still feels like some sort of dream
4129617 gary and i have often spoke of being legal at least in some state during our lifetime california had made that dream come true
4129618 during the hour and a half we were in the san francisco courthouse one couple after another were filing into the marriage license office
4129619 im amazed that with the amount of same sex couples that were constantly going in and out that california would have any problems at all defeating the ban but hey you never know
4129620 as our son got older we were trying to instill in him that our family is not the same but equal to any other family and it was important for us to be married
4129621 when we weighed how important it was to define our relationship and family then there was no price that could keep us from going
4129622 if it stands in california then same sex marriage is going to happen everywhere else rather quickly
4129623 i just dont see how the other states can hold the line that they have right now for very much longer
4129624 everything that a married couple could possibly have we have other than the state recognizing our relationship
4129625 we have got volunteers and donors and supporters and activists involved in a way that in all my years in politics i have never seen before
4129626 we really have a veritable army that is working to defeat prop 8 so i am super optimistic
4129627 whats remarkable about that is large companies of that nature rarely contribute to a purely political campaign other than something they believe directly affects them
4129628 thats what the opposition has said they will spend against us and we plan to match them dollar for dollar or better
4129629 folks around the country who care about freedom and equality know that thats whats on the ballot out in california so we have received really wonderful support from folks around the country
4129630 california is very often a leader in civil rights kinds of battles
4129631 its been an amazing experience to travel across the country to fight for marriage equality
4129632 i truly believe that the people of arizona will uphold their decision from 2006 not to enshrine discrimination in their constitution
4129633 theyve made it perfectly clear how they feel about this discriminatory amendment and unfortunately its the politicians of the state who are still pushing this divisive issue
4129634 times are changing and we now have the momentum on our side
4129635 so its imperative that georgians dont become discouraged by the lack of marriage equality in our state and work towards achieving it elsewhere with the hopes of bringing it home
4129636 i indicated to the organisers of indy last year that i thought we could be doing better in relation to managing some of the more lewd behaviour
4129637 i dont think anyone wants to see the fun taken out of indy but i dont think most people want to see it cross the line into obscenity either
4129638 you can have a lot of fun without turning off international visitors and spectators
4129639 if the police can identify you they can make a charge
4129640 thats why we now find we are in a position to cut interest rates
4129641 we cannot wait to see a fall in inflation before we start cutting rates because by then it would be too late
4129642 i would expect like the reserve bank that any reduction in interest rates would be passed on by the banks
4129643 but i can understand why their chief executive officers are being cautious about giving rolled gold guarantees about these things because theyve got other factors that they have to worry about as well
4129644 the banks will carry a very heavy onus to explain any variation from any reduction by the reserve bank in the rates as compared with what they actually do
4129645 we are pleased to add kwame brown to our roster
4129646 kwame is a player that gives us depth at the center position and we feel that he will have the opportunity to grow within our system
4129647 we are very excited that we have reached an agreement with lou williams
4129648 he is not only a very talented player who exemplifies our up tempo style of play but he is also a young man who exhibits great character and qualities off the court as well we look forward to having him in a sixers uniform for many years to come
4129649 were happy that lou is back as he has proven to be an integral part of the team
4129650 hes made great strides as a player and were very confident hell continue to excel with us for years to come
4129651 he made me turn all the way around while he stared me up and down
4129652 the only thing he said was that other people didnt like the way i looked so he wanted me to leave
4129653 i want to speak for everybody else who has been discriminated against but has never said anything
4129654 i want them to apologize and let them know that in this day and age a woman has a right to wear what she wants
4129655 tarence is a talented young perimeter player that has good length and athleticism
4129656 he has shown an ability to be an effective player on both ends of the court
4129657 they were getting huge shacks laird was slotting into massive heaving waves with ease mesmerized by eddie and vedders vocals in the barrel were unstoppable
4129658 having a good song in my head thatll be helpful
4129659 laird is realizing what kind of magic this planet holds
4129660 probably closer at one point than hamilton and vedder are now and vedder never did anything like this for slater that kind of news can definitely affect your game
4129661 to use religion as a reason to refuse blind and disabled passengers is unjustified
4129662 arroyo is a player of the highest standard and has been our top priority for a while
4129663 but we gave it everything and im proud of what we have achieved its been an honour to play with nathan and an honour to be an olympian and to be here at the olympics
4129664 its bloody annoying to lose in the quarter final but it was a tough draw anyway we knew if we got through the first match that they the south koreans are a fantastic pair
4129665 they didnt give us a chance to play our game and you have to give credit to them
4129666 which is easiest for someone your age to buy cigarettes beer marijuana or prescription drugs such as oxycontin percocet vicodin or ritalin without a prescription
4129667 this is a very different generation of children prescription drugs are entrenched and they have not moved for five years and this generation of parents simply do not understand the problem
4129668 the sad part is a lot of people wont be surprised its tragic its sad all we have to do is have one our ships hit and a bunch of americans killed and one or two news stations say it was the iranians and the countrys going to be ready to go to war theyd even be willing to call a draft to say we have to go to save israel we have to march in so we need a draft thats the worst part that i fear
4129669 contrived gulf of tonkin style incident that may well occur to gain popular support for an attack on iran
4129670 despite the opposition of his own generals and widespread skepticism that america is ready to risk the military political and economic consequences of an airborne strike on iran the president has given an
4129671 this combined with years of intense drought floods and bush fires has seen red kangaroos western grey kangaroos eastern grey kangaroos wallaroos and euros plummet to densities of less than five per square kilometre or quasi extinct across most of queensland nsw and south australia
4129672 these species are now at risk of extinction in these states if the commercial industry is allowed to continue
4129673 we have grave fears for the future existence of kangaroos and the fact that these state governments have already set commercial kill quotas at 12 to 20 per cent of the population for the next four years
4129674 if they havent got anyone with enough guts im prepared to risk myself to do it
4129675 hendra virus is going to come back again and again and again because it comes from bats and theres millions of bats and theyre a protected species we need to know a lot more about it
4129676 it was overturned on the basis not enough is known about the virus to be sure the horse will not pose a threat to human health quite simply its just not worth the risk
4129677 so many chemists went to the wall because of pan

4129679 me and jay decided im going to stay with him

4129681 what were going to do is im going to stay in the game plan and at night were going to throw
4129682 and after we throw well watch film and hes going to go over the game plan with me as if i was there
4129683 the whole denver broncos organization has been great to me
4129684 all i can do is just show them that im here now and when i get back and be accountable
4129685 i dont think they have a reason to throw at me so im not sweating that i think theyre trying to pitch me in and the ball got away

4129714 can exercise a great deal of self control if an experience becomes painful you cut yourself off from your feelings rather than continue to suffer

4129720 made it very clear that he would not plead to an assault charge of any kind
4129721 we would have certainly negotiated something else if they would have been willing to admit some responsibility but they never were

4129743 they are playing their only new england show here that is going to be big
4129744 for me personally now living a sober life a completely sober life my life has changed 360 degrees for the better
4129745 brian started a family you know all of us have had the time to really do some personal growth and i think each of us now are able to bring something a little different to the table
4129746 i think when we had the chance to find ourselves again it made each of us stronger when we came back to the table to work as a group
4129747 it gave us a chance to recharge rejuvenate you know miss each other and also at the same time learn about life we bring a lot more to the table now whether its experiences that weve dealt with in the last couple years that go into our music or whether its just the way we treat each other respect each other the break was very beneficial for us to hopefully be around like the eagles and aerosmith and people like that who take breaks every so often to have a long term career
4129748 you know weve been working our butts off in touring i mean weve been on eight years of touring nonstop all around the world four albums you know it was just time to take a break
4129749 i find the fun is back and the adventure is back in it again
4129750 the music industry has changed and i find it very exciting to know that its an adventure again
4129751 weve been doing this for 15 years now and were still here were still having fun which is a huge key for us there is just kind of a staying power and the respect among our peers in the industry as well as the media and from our fans
4129752 as long as we put together a great body of work and really really good albums and were really proud of it our fans are happy with it thats all that matters to us
4129753 and at the end of the day were just out there playing music for our fans and for ourselves
4129754 its been really really good seeing a lot of familiar faces and seeing a lot of our fans that have grown with us over the years that are now married with kids and having their own families
4129755 and to their kids or to their younger sisters and brothers were almost a brand new group its really kind of refreshing to still be doing this and to kind of have a whole new outlook on our careers
4129756 im sure the guys will do something embarrassing on stage as they always do on birthdays
4129757 our fans have been dealing with this stuff for many years and they usually bring cards and signs its always nice being recognized for those details
4129758 like a kid barely older than 21 i definitely dont feel 35 but then ive never looked at age as a number i dont look at it as wow youre getting up in years its how you feel in your heart
4129759 i was just with kevin a couple days ago hes probably one of the best friends ive ever had hes just wanting to start a family theyve got a beautiful baby boy and he and his wife are in a great place
4129760 hes doing some acting in a movie being directed by lou diamond phillips for hallmark
4129761 but the door will always be open for him if he ever decides to come back
4129762 but well be able to compensate for it and adapt to it once we get into a couple songs the fans wont notice any differences
4129763 being with us on tour leigh had seen the craziness of it all and was my biggest supporter she really digs it when girls go crazy and ask to take a picture with me shell say here give me the camera and let me take it shes totally cool with it theres no jealousy at all
4129764 thats probably been the hardest thing to deal with of all
4129765 but the guys in the band have been totally there for me to my surprise they all flew in for his funeral were just a really tight unit that way and the fans have been so supportive both with my sister and now my father
4129766 a lot of the fans we see are from the very beginning and theyre older and some of them are married and the tone to the screams is not as high as it used to be
4129767 my own niece wasnt even born at the time we began and shes become one of our biggest fans
4129768 just the other day when i was on a road trip with my family we stopped at a cracker barrel to grab some food and this little old lady came up to me
4129769 so some of our biggest fans are now 75 its amazing
4129770 all i can do is be me whoever that is
4129771 you never miss the water till the well run dry
4129772 one more inch into that stuff and im warning you im going to scream go ahead try me
4129773 what does this bunch of poor feeble jews think theyre doing do they think they can build the wall in a single day by just offering a few sacrifices do they actually think they can make something of stones from a rubbish heap and charred ones at that
4129774 that stone wall would collapse if even a fox walked along the top of it
4129775 hear us our god for we are being mocked may their scoffing fall back on their own heads and may they themselves become captives in a foreign land do not ignore their guilt do not blot out their sins for they have provoked you to anger here in front of the builders
4129776 the workers are getting tired and there is so much rubble to be moved we will never be able to build the wall by ourselves
4129777 before they know whats happening we will swoop down on them and kill them and end their work
4129778 dont be afraid of the enemy remember the lord who is great and glorious and fight for your brothers your sons your daughters your wives and your homes
4129779 the work is very spread out and we are widely separated from each other along the wall when you hear the blast of the trumpet rush to wherever it is sounding then our god will fight for us
4129780 we want to take this realistic approach to enlarge the genre because its much more universal
4129781 weve been shifting from classic survival horror from back in 2001 with alone in the dark the new nightmare and we started to introduce disaster aspect with cold fear
4129782 now we are moving to a more realistic approach to survival and thats what we want to renew and bring with this new game
4129783 i think we are already one of the major european studios with 120 people we think 2009 will be where we shine were set for a new stage
4129784 i have great faith and trust and belief in dustin grutza
4129785 like we always said one guy doesnt have to win the game its how does that 1 11th of the team make sure were in the right play with the leadership and with the other guys rallying around him and respecting him hes a guy that commands respect hes a loyal guy and he cares deeply he works his butt off out there some of those mistakes the coaches have to clean up some of those mistakes he has to clean up collectively i dont have any questions whatsoever
4129786 that competition lets face it brings out the best in guys
4129787 thats the great thing about having extra competition out there when you have more guys than you have starting positions youve got a handful of guys who all want to be that guy that brings the best out of people
4129788 im preparing as hard as i can we have big goals this year winning the big east championship were trying to get the guys and lead them i feel good in what i can do
4129789 ich habe f r deine ex mit der zeit gef hle entwickelt und wollte eben fragen wie du es finden w rdest wenn wir zusammen k men es ist nur rein hypothetisch aber sei ehrlich zu mir das ist mir wichtig
4129790 hey alter deine ex is heiss was w rdest du sagen wenn ich mit ihr zusammen komme
4129791 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4129792 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4129793 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4129794 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4129795 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4129796 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4129797 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4129798 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4129799 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4129800 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4129801 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4129802 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4129803 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4129804 the three were part of the mdc delegation that was going to south africa for the sadc summit to be held this weekend

4129851 i have no idea where that story has come from no one has approached us about paul konchesky because it is pretty obvious to everyone we are not interested in the slightest about selling paul konchesky
4129852 and if i was paul konchesky i would be very sad to see my name linked with a 2million transfer when i am a player who is worth a lot more than that
4129853 god only knows where that has come from there must be a reason for it someone must have an agenda and is using pauls name to further it

4129870 weve got some great ambassadors for the future of the sport on this team
4129871 but they also understand that one way to be great ambassadors for future canadian players is to put a quality product on the field and prove what canada can do in the olympic arena and the only way they to do that well is to focus on one pitch at a time
4129872 the product and the way theyre going about it is the only thing we can control in terms of how we affect the future
4129873 i have no idea we will let politics go where they will were going for the gold medal
4129874 is this going to be a slam dunk is this going to be easy absolutely not
4129875 but the fact of the matter is i think weve got a good story to tell
4129876 weve demonstrated that this is a sport that has performed well in the olympic games met the olympic ideal female sport global in nature clean doping record
4129877 obviously im biased but its great spectator entertainment these are the best athletes at what they do in the world its an exciting fast sport to watch if youre a fan at all of a bat and ball game i think this is as good as there is out there

4129882 that georgia or anyone else had the right to apply for membership of nato and the eu without russia asserting a veto
4129883 georgia has no contiguous border with the eu and meets none of the economic requirements for membership of an organisation that has already got itself into enough problems with trying to absorb bulgaria and romania prematurely without a new member lacking even common borders
4129884 nato membership is even more problematic the us wants georgia as an inroad into the russian sphere of influence georgia wants membership to give it a military backing against russia yet as chancellor merkel keeps pointing out it is not in natos interests to be dragged into the kind of territorial squabble that we have just witnessed
4129885 punishing russia for its actions would only serve further to damage our own interests for the sake of disguising our impotence
4129886 provide full incoming and outgoing sms service without passing along operator fees
4129887 mobile operators in most of the world charge users to send updates when you send one message to twitter and we send it to ten followers you arent charged ten times thats because weve been footing the bill
4129888 it makes more sense for us to establish fair billing arrangements with mobile operators than it does to pass these high fees on to our users

4129890 the idea is not to live forever it is to create something that will
4129891 i think for starters his works have never been looked at from this perspective before
4129892 so there have been and there continues to be a lot of andy warhol shows around the country but this is the first time anybody has ever looked at it from the political point of view with his political works and brought them all together in one room
4129893 it was really that work which was really an important print project that warhol did and our acquisition of it and sort of looking at that and deciding which direction to go
4129894 and of course the timing this is planned for the fall with the presidential election and such it sort of seemed like the right time
4129895 i think the fact that it focuses on these political figures is unique but i think a lot of people hear the name andy warhol and they have certain images that come to mind
4129896 but i dont think when people hear his name that they necessarily think of these political figures and the fact that he was often commissioned to do portraits by presidential candidates so i think people will be surprised to learn about this aspect of warhols career
4129897 i want to be in a program with people my age
4129898 its probably under the never take anything for granted philosophy to which i certainly subscribe
4129899 i think its great that theyre doing that its brand reinforcement maybe its trying to attract a more vast audience a younger audience but a constant reminder of their presence in the marketplace is a good thing even as big as they are
4129900 one of the things we learned with the sox is youve got to get the web community the bloggers to have an opinion and to comment
4129901 the bears wanted to remind everybody that there is a devout following for this team but its not just this team its your neighbors its your city
4129902 youre passionate about your team youre passionate about what you do for a living and youre passionate about your city
4129903 it was nowhere near as brand related as this was
4129904 this might not be something we have to do every year were obviously very fortunate where were not in need of selling tickets but that doesnt mean we still dont have an opportunity to strengthen the connection with our fan base
4129905 obviously there are a lot of people out there sending out messages about the bears that we have no control over so we wanted to make sure we were part of that conversation as well

4129924 bbc news certainly does not have a line on climate change however the weight of our coverage reflects the fact that there is an increasingly strong although not overwhelming weight of scientific opinion in favour of the proposition that climate change is happening and is being largely caused by man bbc news programmes and our website of course reflect alternative views but we do not balance these views mathematically as that is not our judgement about where the argument has now reached that is definitely not the same as us propagating a view ourselves about climate change its not our job to do that
4129925 the bbc has held a high level seminar with some of the best scientific experts and has come to the view that the weight of evidence no longer justifies equal space being given to the opponents of the consensus on anthropogenic climate change
4129926 a central way to help youth counteract distorted views presented by the media and culture about girls sex and the sexualization of girls is contraception the importance of delaying intercourse initiation for young people and the building of communication skills and promotes a notion of sexual responsibility that includes respect for oneself and an emphasis on consensual non exploitative sexual activity
4129927 i think governor strickland can be a huge help to senator obama and i think he will be
