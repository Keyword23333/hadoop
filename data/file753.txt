7530073 we continue to see little chance for oil to be used by russia as a bargaining tool

7530103 the disclosure advisory board welcomes the secs guidance about use of company websites for meeting corporate disclosure obligations since the widespread adoption of the internet by investors the means of disclosure have multiplied providing investors with a wide choice in accessing a companys news
7530104 public companies in the united states have been challenged in determining the role of the company website in achieving compliance with disclosure obligations the sec and u s stock exchanges have in some cases required companies to use their websites to make certain disclosures e g governance documents but in other cases have been reluctant to sanction website postings as an appropriate channel e g regulation fd disclosure the secs willingness to provide additional guidance is thus a welcome development
7530105 while at least one company sun microsystems reached that conclusion even prior to the secs guidance based on a specific set of procedures many companies may not wish to lead the pack in this area absent greater regulatory certainty those companies will instead continue to retain the news release as the centerpiece along with periodic reports of their communication strategy others particularly companies with a limited analyst following will consider the news release to be the best way to command immediate attention from investors analysts and journalists
7530106 companies interested in taking advantage of the guidance will also face a number of questions raised by the sec which may also inhibit reliance on the secs guidance

7530156 this special session features a special delivery for connecticut families
7530157 wages are stagnant inflation is rampant the price of heat is up and the temperature is about to go down our bi partisan energy assistance plan will deliver critical assistance to low and middle income families
7530158 i am thankful that we were able to work with gov rell and colleagues in the house to reach agreement on this critical piece of legislation
7530159 our families face a crisis this winter and we expect many people to seek assistance for the first time this legislation will go a long way to helping families of all income levels make ends meet in addition the legislation will deliver funding to municipalities to help them heat classrooms this winter something that is sure to benefit local taxpayers
7530160 i am pleased that we were able to defeat republican attempts to shortchange low and middle income families
7530161 we know just as gov rell does that families will need all the help they can get heating their homes this winter it is unfortunate that so many republican senators broke with their own governor to oppose this legislation but i am pleased that we were able to stand up and ensure that the state surplus will go back to families after all connecticut may have finished the year with a small surplus but most connecticut families will not

7530170 it is time for pastors to stand up and speak out against the forces that attempt to bully them into silence during election season
7530171 pastors have a responsibility to affirm moral principles in politics despite the illegitimate outcries of separation of church and state from the uninformed
7530172 that such a large amount of fish is used for the pet food industry is real eye opener
7530173 what is also interesting is that in australia pet cats are eating an estimated 13 7 kilograms of fish a year which far exceeds the australian average per capita fish and seafood consumption of around 11 kilograms our pets seem to be eating better than their owners
7530174 while much of the criticism has been on the grounds that forage fish could be better used for human consumption directly particularly amongst the poorer nations of the world rather than in the production of food for farmed fish little attention has been paid to the amount of forage fish used by the pet food industry
7530175 pet ownership is increasing globally the pet food industry is moving towards a constant increase of production and manufacturing and marketing premium and super premium products these gourmet pet foods contain a significant amount of fish that may be suitable for direct human consumption while different raw material unsuitable for human consumption such as by products of the fish filleting industry could be used
7530176 i am not advocating the need to reduce significantly the fishmeal and fish oil use in aquaculture if it were to sustain in the long term in this regard it is important to note that all sectors associated with the aquaculture industry are making a concerted effort to reduce the use of forage fish
7530177 the central issue is not an advocacy of pets versus aquaculture or other agricultural animal husbandry activities but the need for a more objective and pragmatic approach to the use of a limited and decreasing biological resource for human benefit

7530200 survivors of haemorrhagic shock describe many different experiences ranging from fear to relative calm
7530201 in large part this would depend on what and how extensive the associated injuries were a single penetrating wound to the femoral artery in the leg might be less painful than multiple fractures sustained in a motor vehicle crash
7530202 third degree burns do not hurt as much as second degree wounds as superficial nerves are destroyed but the difference is semantic large burns are horrifically painful in any instance
7530203 what the hangmen were looking for was quick cessation of activity

7530207 the field of anticancer vaccines has been so disappointing that there is major skepticism
7530208 this is clearly a positive result for the cancer immunotherapy space which continues to have both strong supporters and strong skeptics
7530209 in our opinion the data represent the first definitive phase 3 positive outcome in the cancer immunotherapy space we believe the data will surprise a lot of investors after previous failures by genitope and favrille
7530210 the biovaxid trial was a well designed carefully constructed trial that started in 1999
7530211 proteostasis therapeutics brings together innovative discoveries leading scientists and a foundation of intellectual property related to the proteostasis network and proteostasis regulators arising from northwestern university the salk institute and the scripps research institute
7530212 proteostasis therapeutics is uniquely positioned to commercialize this fundamentally new way of thinking about therapeutic intervention for a broad range of diseases
7530213 the company has established a map of the proteostasis network leading to breakthroughs in understanding how stress on the network including aging environmental and cellular stresses can lead to the onset of multiple serious diseases
7530214 with this new knowledge pti has identified unique targets as well as small molecules that offer the promise of restoring the balance of the network while preventing the toxicity of damaged proteins associated with disease
7530215 proteostasis therapeutics has discovered a new frontier in medicine with the identification of several classes of small molecule proteostasis regulators that can precisely rebalance the capacity of the proteostasis network
7530216 these cell permeable small molecules exhibit the capacity to ameliorate multiple genetic degenerative and metabolic diseases spanning nearly all the classical therapeutic areas
7530217 our initial funding of pti over a year ago provided the basis for this emerging area of science to mature so that it now offers the promise of new drug candidates entering the clinic in the next 3 5 years
7530218 the significant series a round is designed to support ptis strategy to advance proprietary compounds into the clinic as well as to continue to develop the unique technology platform that will serve as the basis for strategic partnerships
7530219 we are very pleased to have astrazeneca as licensee for our rsv program on a global basis astrazenecas tremendous track record in developing and marketing small molecule therapeutics will be of great benefit in bringing new rsv products to the market
7530220 this is part of a growing commitment for astrazeneca in antiviral therapies we look forward to using our drug discovery and development expertise to bring biotas innovative rsv platform to the benefit of patients worldwide with rsv it will be an exciting collaboration in which we intend to leverage the strengths of both companies
7530221 in colorado we need to watch out for continued growth in jobs and a disconnect between the pipeline of people or lack thereof in our educational institutions and available high paying jobs
7530222 i would like to have 15 of these type of companies
7530223 we are encouraged that the results of the japanese and u s studies are consistent and both suggest that nitric oxide donation may allow a more sustained intraocular pressure lowering effect nicox and pfizer are in active discussions regarding the worldwide rights to pf 03187207 which we believe has a certain commercial potential which should be realized we are also pleased by the progress that has been made in the research program focused on diabetic retinopathy where we hope a lead compound will be selected in the first half of next year
7530224 were not sure at this point its a go its a very important component for the bio cluster but its also a very expensive project

7530227 its hard to get their attention if youre a small company
7530228 we do have 25 000 square foot spaces available on optical court east of the freeway
7530229 theres a good amount of availability and vacant land they may want to build their own facility
7530230 we are very pleased with the outcome of this exploratory study
7530231 we are particularly interested in the responses around skin quality as this is the first time we have assessed the isolagen therapy for these important skin characteristics
7530232 as the principal investigator in the isolagen it r 007 trial i am optimistic about the study results which show improvement in patients facial appearance
7530233 the results suggest that improvements in both skin texture and contour may be achieved following isolagen treatment i believe this outcome is a unique finding in the cosmetic injectable treatment market utilizing the subjects own living cells to provide the basis for improvement

7530259 the courts decision to dismiss the appeal of convicted sex offender darren anthony francis is confirmation of the constitutional validity of our sex offender laws
7530260 we make no apologies for our sex offender legislation which is the toughest in australia and we will continue to review our laws to ensure offenders released into the community by the court are properly supervised
7530261 however as this case has shown we have to be very careful that our legislation is not ruled unconstitutional by the courts
7530262 our main priority is the protection of the community by reducing the risk of these people re offending
7530263 the work program has contributed about 165 340 hours of labour valued at almost 2 5 million to community projects in the past year
7530264 work camps provide low risk prisoners with genuine opportunities to make a positive contribution to society while developing new skills and a work ethic
7530265 they are one of the most successful prisoner rehabilitation programs in queensland
7530266 my congratulations to the corrective services staff and the prisoners involved
7530267 community advisory committees made up of council local police and community representatives also play an important role in the success of the work camps
7530268 their assistance and guidance is appreciated by corrective services field supervisors who manage the day to day activities of each camp
7530269 these camps continue to prove their worth to rural and regional communities by enabling the completion of work that otherwise would not be done
7530270 you can really see that emily is enchanted by nature using environmentally friendly and sustainable fabrics such as organic cotton bamboo and some silk hemp blends
7530271 emilys talent was recognised early this year when she was chosen as one of two young queenslanders to have their work showcased at sydneys fashion exposed one of premier fashion fairs
7530272 emily is one of the promising designers retailing at the fortitude valleys the tribune a concept store promoting young talented designers some of whom are also being showcased in the queensland government design innovation group show
7530273 i was very happy once i heard the news that i was chosen for queensland government design innovation group show and im excited to be able to take part in such a prestigious event
7530274 mbff has been a hugely successful event every year and its really putting brisbane fashion on the map
7530275 the event gives emerging designers a lot of coverage and i love the fact that the fashion shows are open for the public to see
7530276 taking part in the fashion festival will not only give me the chance to learn more about the industry but also give my designs exposure to potential retail stockists
7530277 i like to design clothes that are young casual but still dressy and feminine with a relaxed fit
7530278 a big focus for me is fashion which comes from a more ethical source and not made in sweatshops
7530279 at this stage my goals would be to keep enjoying fashion keep moving up and producing new ideas and concepts while expanding my stockists along the way
7530280 the designers picked were chosen for their labels youthful appeal and design innovation
7530281 emily was chosen because her debut collection is made using environmentally friendly and sustainable fabrics her designs are a marriage of classic shapes and youthful appeal
7530282 my department has spoken with south australian authorities after they withdrew six toys from their show and immediately reviewed the inspections conducted at the rna show
7530283 all show bags which were for sale were inspected at the rna show and one toy clown was removed from a show bag due to excessive lead levels
7530284 not all of the toys identified in south australia were sold at the ekka
7530285 oft inspectors have advised me they are confident two guns with laser pointers withdrawn in south australia were not on sale at the ekka
7530286 inspectors have advised me a puzzle toy withdrawn in south australia was not marketed at children under three at the ekka and was clearly labelled on both the toy and the show bag as only being suitable for children over three years
7530287 had it been marketed at children under this age inspectors would have ordered its removal from the show bag
7530288 inspectors also closely examined a soft toy at the ekka which was withdrawn in south australia and were satisfied it met the mandatory safety standards after the supplier produced a compliance report
7530289 as always i encourage parents attending shows to consider the safety of items and only buy show bags that are labelled as suitable for the age of your child
7530290 if any consumer find a toy they think is unsafe they should report it to the office of fair trading on 13 13 04
7530291 the gold coast is one of the fastest growing areas in queensland and as families move to enjoy its great lifestyle the demand for quality education increases
7530292 park lake state school is one of three new gold coast schools to open this year and our investment doesnt end there
7530293 of the four schools my government has committed to build this financial year three of them are on the gold coast and will be open for business in 2009
7530294 thats six new schools and an increase of 3680 in enrolment capacity in just two years
7530295 the school has 20 classrooms as well as resource and music centres an administration building full oval and sports storage area a covered area and canteen
7530296 a 300 000 litre onsite water storage is used for irrigation and the operation of amenities and energy management features include a managed lighting system that turns off lights if a room is empty
7530297 these sustainable features also help the students learn about the importance of looking after our environment and teachers have included them as part of the curriculum
7530298 park lake state school is also fully networked with fibre optic and wireless internet capabilities ensuring students have access to state of the art information and communication technology facilities
7530299 we want to ensure our school building projects keep pace with growth and students have access to the best possible facilities to support their education
7530300 energex has listened to community concerns and has been back to the drawing board a number of times to come up with an option that has the least impact on local properties
7530301 the member for mudgeeraba di reilly will take to suburban streets tomorrow to talk further to residents about the issue and listen to their concerns
7530302 energex has been involved in ongoing consultation with the community and this will continue
7530303 theyre always hard decisions to make but if we simply sat on our hands we would be letting down up to half a million people who live and work on the gold coast and the tourists who holiday there every year
7530304 they have every right to demand a government be prepared to take tough decisions on vital infrastructure issues we wouldnt have a gateway motorway or a south east busway an airport link or a tugun bypass if we didnt take tough decisions
7530305 perhaps the honourable leader of the opposition might like to speak with the liberal national party member for currumbin before he starts suggesting another route such as through the tallebudgera valley
7530306 or maybe he would like to justify spending up to 120 million of taxpayers money to put the lines underground does the opposition leader want no lights does he want power lines running through the back streets of the gold coast
7530307 i first became aware of the letter around midday on friday 22 august and after reviewing its contents convened a meeting with officials to discuss the allegations
7530308 at that meeting i asked for the department to formally assess the material and refer the matter on to the cmc and any other body as necessary
7530309 i have been advised by the under treasurer that the material is now in the hands of the cmc
7530310 we want to build queenslands annual world class music industry event to complement and equal established annual events like los angeles musexpo or the great escape festival in brighton uk
7530311 trade queenslands commitment to support brisbanes annual big sound event in 2008 will help to fast track export opportunities and capitalise on the states growing international reputation as a source of new music talent
7530312 queenslands capital brisbane is becoming recognised overseas as one of the worlds top cities for new world class music talent and music industry expertise and there is a wealth of music industry talent across queensland
7530313 big sound is about connecting the connectors in the music industry by not only launching new artists but also by linking them with relevant new and innovative business people and ideas to help them build international careers
7530314 trade queenslands sponsorship for the event in 2008 will go toward attracting overseas industry tastemakers and representatives of high profile international agencies and outlets
7530315 reports are that she approached the ips iraqi police saying she had the vest on and didnt want to go through with it
7530316 if she was forced to put on the vest or if she did it voluntarily that is still being reviewed
7530317 our police pipes and drums band is considered one of the most prestigious bands of its kind in the world
7530318 we are fortunate to have this calibre of band entertaining communities around queensland and representing our state across the globe
7530319 i have had the opportunity to see them in action on many occasions and it is always a great show
7530320 officer in charge senior sergeant peter flexman has been a leader within the band for more than 30 years both as a drummer and now as drum major he joined the police service in march 1977 and has been a dedicated member of the band since
7530321 senior sergeant flexman and his fellow band members do excellent work building positive links between police and the community breaking down barriers through music
7530322 on the bands golden anniversary it is wonderful to see queenslands police pipes and drums continue in the footsteps of its founders and build on their success i have no doubt that the fine traditions of this band are in excellent hands
7530323 considered one of the most accomplished pipe bands in the world queensland police pipes amp drums has also proven itself to be one of the most powerful tools the queensland police service uses to connect with the community
7530324 it performs for around 350 queensland audiences a year and does so to not only entertain and educate but to also help raise valuable funds for worthwhile community causes and organisations
7530325 the men and women of queensland police pipes amp drums both past and present have achieved much both at home and abroad
7530326 the queensland police pipes amp drums 50th anniversary dinner is a wonderful opportunity to recognise the dedication and passion each and every member has brought to the band over the past 50 years
7530327 thats why we are putting a 20 year moratorium on all mining activities bulk sampling and exploration over the mcfarlane deposit in the whitsunday region
7530328 this stops immediate plans to dig up approximately 400 000 tonnes of rock for resource testing from this world famous landscape
7530329 only one lease supported by the previous national party government currently exists to mine shale oil and that is in gladstone
7530330 no new shale oil mines will be permitted anywhere in the state
7530331 government will devote the next two years to researching whether shale oil deposits can be used in an environmentally acceptable way
7530332 but we have to ensure that in the process we dont sacrifice what makes our regions great the environment and lifestyle they provide
7530333 it is time in queenslands extraordinary transformation that we pause draw breath and make sure were not losing what makes our state a terrific place to live work and raise a family
7530334 while the development of shale oil has potential as an energy source we will not allow it until we can be assured that it can be extracted and processed without harming the environment
7530335 this is particularly the case for the mcfarlane deposit 15 kilometres south of proserpine which is located right on the gateway to the great barrier reef
7530336 there are existing mining tenures over the gladstone shale deposit already and those rights will remain in effect
7530337 the owner of the lease at gladstone is currently examining the commercial viability of a demonstration plant using new shale oil processing technology
7530338 over the next 2 years the government will review the technology and if it stacks up economically technologically and environmentally we will work with industry to see if it could have a broader application further down the track
7530339 if the objectives of commercial feasibility and environmental acceptance can be met queensland could eventually become a major producer of non conventional oil to help meet national and international demand

7530356 the entertainment has been very good theyve put on fantastic shows everybody has enjoyed the shows the carnival has done a fantastic job the streets are filled and we have heard very positive comments about the entertainment on the freedom stage
7530357 we know that some of our shows the saturday show ferras especially took a hit and that will affect the bottom line but at the same time it cant be the deciding factor on the festival because you had other shows that are going very well
7530358 the thing with ferras that we saw that was so encouraging is that those who came who didnt know who he was really enjoyed the show and after the show went out looking to get his cd
7530359 we had more vendors this year than weve had in a long time and it keeps increasing it was great to see the crowds downtown and i heard from many people that on friday night you really couldnt even move on main street and thats a great thing to have happen

7530402 the following work is by no means the fruit of any inner urge on the contrary
7530403 nevertheless it was a year before i could make up my mind to neglect other work and get my teeth into this sour apple it was the kind of apple that once bitten into had to be completely devoured and it was not only very sour but also very large the new socialist theory was presented as the ultimate practical fruit of a new philosophical system it was therefore necessary to examine it in the context of this system and in doing so to examine the system itself it was necessary to follow herr d hring into that vast territory in which he dealt with all things under the sun and with some others as well
7530404 philosophers have only interpreted the world in different ways the point however is to change it
7530405 the great advantage of this is that nobody knows what it means it is an empty bottle that can be filled with any content one chooses when we talk about socialism of the 21st century we first have to establish what kind of socialism are we talking about
7530406 i also contributed the idea of a socialism of the 21st century along with a few other things in which my modest theoretical contributions can probably help to positively support the process
7530407 go beyond the mere criticism of global capitalism and the historical
7530408 interpretations of what marx and lenin really meant to say
7530409 basic psychology teaches us that if we cannot define the objective it is not likely that we shall understand if the tendencies of reality favour the results of our efforts or are going the opposite way
7530410 without the orientation of concrete and specific objectives all human praxis is diffuse and tends to become disappointed or lose its way because of the obstacles that appear along the way
7530411 combines the powerful method of scientific reasoning with the objective of 6 to begin with let us observe that this objective could be accepted in principle by any social democrat reformist parson or bourgeois philanthropist
7530412 in arguing too the parson owned his skill for even though vanquished he could argue still while words of learned length and thundering sound amazed the gazing rustics ranged around and still they gazed and still the wonder grew that one small head could carry all he knew
7530413 just as there is a breadth which is empty so there is a depth which is empty also
7530414 what comandante ch vez and the marginalized people of humanity seek and what they need is not a new critique negation of a bad reality created by capital but the viable alternative of a new and more humane civilization that is to say an antisystemic and anticapitalist alternative
7530415 to publish this book with the title socialism of the 21st century just over a decade after the fall of the berlin wall is therefore not a utopian or nostalgic act there is no frivolity or utopianism nor any lack of historical memory in its creation it is the very period of social evolution which determines its appearance
7530416 overwhelmed by the daily existential anguish of his precarious reproduction without any spiritual transcendence beyond the triviality of consumerism the alienated subject cannot solve his situation within bourgeois society but only in a kind of qualitative different cohabitation like participative democracy
7530417 the answer is that social classes for example workers toilers trabajadores farmers professional people small and big employers empresarios fight over the social wealth that is to say the surplus product or the economic surplus that society generates unfortunately this fight is comparable to a pack of dogs fighting over a prey that is not sufficient for all the strongest seize the prey and they marginalize or exclude the others
7530418 the strongest seize the prey and they marginalize or exclude the others
7530419 an historical project constructed around four constituent elements the non mercantile economy based upon use value real participative democracy a democratic state and self determined rational ethical subject
7530420 the creation of a new scientific ethical aesthetic theory of postcapitalist social transformation in the 21st century
7530421 because the new civilization of participative democracy will be qualitatively different from present day capitalism in fact as different as for example a butterfly and a caterpillar
7530422 although the butterfly and a caterpillar share the same genome they are born from the same roots they evolve towards qualitatively different forms of life
7530423 while one of them crawls on the ground the other flies in the air
7530424 that is to say from the same origins totally different forms of life can evolve and the same is true of capitalism and participative democracy
7530425 but if the animal makes a qualitative leap through its biological predetermination what will generate the new social state in humanity sic the answer is obvious really the conscious praxis of human beings just as the caterpillar develops in its life cycle the objective conditions for the flight of the butterfly so capitalist society generates the conditions for the flight of human society towards the socialism of the new era
7530426 yes i developed it beginning in 1996 it has been published with its corresponding theory in book form from 2000 on in mexico ecuador argentina central america brazil and venezuela and outside latin america in spain germany the peoples republic of china russia and turkey since 2001 it has been appropriated all over the world presidents like hugo ch vez and rafael correa use it constantly and so do labour movements farmers intellectuals and political parties
7530427 along with the theory of socialism of the 21st century i advanced the theory of latin american transition that is expressed in key concepts like the regional block of power bloque regional de poder or brp also already in general use in latin america however the concept regional block of popular power bloque regional de poder popular or brpp was proposed by a venezuelan friend douglas p rez in a business meeting three months ago
7530428 in brief a socialism in which the majorities have the greatest historically possible degree of decision making power in the economic political cultural and military institutions that govern their lives
7530429 a it is not generalized nationalization of private property because it does not solve the cybernetic problem of the market it did not do so in the past and it would not do so today socialism today is essentially a problem of informatic complexity
7530430 hence the transcendental step consists in establishing socialist accounting value next to capitalist accounting price in the state pdvsa cvg and cooperatives in order to construct an economic circuit of production and circulation parallel to that of the capitalist market economy the economy of state and social institutions can move step by step toward the economy of value and gain ground against the circuit of capitalist reproduction until it displaces it in the future since the scales of valuation by prices values and also volumes are commensurable there are no ruptures in economic exchanges that could cause a political problem to the government in all this the state and the majorities play an important role but both are nowadays mainly with the project of the president
7530431 the economy of state and social institutions can move step by step toward the economy of value and gain ground against the circuit of capitalist reproduction until it displaces it in the future
7530432 to create this parallel circuit of the economy of value would be relatively easy because values exist in underlying form in the present capitalist accounting values exist in it in such a way that with the development of corresponding software it would be very easy to establish this socialist economic circuit next to the capitalist one without this passage to the economy of equivalency it is not possible to have a socialist economy
7530433 they are two 1 to gradually replace the regulating principle of market economy price by the regulating principle of socialist economy value understood as time inputs insumos de tiempo necessary for the creation of a product and 2 to advance the economic participation of citizens and workers at three levels 1 at the macroeconomic level e g national budget 2 at the mesoeconomic level municipality and 3 at the microeconomic level enterprise
7530434 why did ford get involved in the wsf in the first place
7530435 lisa jordan we value global civic dialogue around global problems we dont necessarily believe solutions lie with any one sector government business and civil society cannot solve problems separately there must be dialogue between and amongst these three groupings
7530436 in fairness the wsf has never said it is a revolutionary grouping its stated principles are those of non violence non violence is fundamental to how it defines itself there has always been a very strong peace agenda at the forum last years forum issued a very beautiful and profound statement in favour of peace
7530437 the next day the chilean intellectual ariel dorfman argued that in such an open forum it was unacceptable to say that socialism was the only option i believe that we must not enter into grandiloquent rhetoric said dorfman who stressed that the porto alegre forum was not a forum to a return to the past i cannot say what the viable option is and i believe neither here nor in davos do we know it the writer finished stressing that it is too soon to formulate a single programme of action
7530438 the big question is therefore how to accumulate the necessary and sufficient power to turn the world upside down how to transform the majorities into the masters of the global society the answer is obvious really through the new historical project nhp constructed by them its content participative democracy this is the theme of this book
7530439 to turn the world upside down and transform the majorities into the masters of the global society
7530440 there are two schools of thought that have advanced this option which option of a new society in their works on socialism of the 21st century the so called scottish school in the brilliant works of the computer expert and economist allin cottrell and the so called bremen school west germany around the universal genius alan peters the mathematician carsten stammer the cuban physicist raimundo franco and others who share their views
7530441 nevertheless despite their cognitive richness they do not provide a sufficient base to adequately respond to the call of comandante ch vez that is to say reading them is a necessary condition for the construction of a new theory but it is not enough
7530442 to the scientist arno peters belongs the merit of having discovered the principle of the future socialist economy setting out from the structural deficiencies of the national market economy
7530443 the land masses look like wet ragged long winter underwear hung out to dry on the arctic circle
7530444 if we dont reverse our accommodative stance sooner rather than later
7530445 we will face rising inflation which may be costly to deal with and we will face a risk to the feds credibility to contain inflation
7530446 its not in direct response to that but weve seen much increased activity in terms of russian overflights of canadian airspace the americans are seeing the same thing around alaska
7530447 so thats one element but its not the only element its something that is now starting to give us some cause for serious concern
7530448 what many thought was a somewhat silly flag planting incident in canadas arctic
7530449 i would say no they are not winning the war
7530450 thats part of the terrorist playbook is to intimidate people
7530451 canadians are not going to be intimidated weve got more grit than that
7530452 our purpose is to exert sovereignty demonstrate sovereignty and security but also learn how to live off the land and learn more about the operating environment here in the north
7530453 the canadian forces along with our other government departments need to be ready to respond to threats such as environmental accidents oil spills and potentially communicable disease outbreaks on a cruise ship
7530454 weve seen much increased activity in terms of russian overflights of canadian airspace the americans are seeing the same thing around alaska
7530455 what many thought was a somewhat silly flag planting incident in canadas arctic

7530484 big money investors have turned oil into a proxy for the u s dollar
7530485 we continue to see little chance for oil to be used by russia as a bargaining tool
7530486 oil is the weapon of last resort not of first resort and it would make no sense for russia to limit exports of crude or products to european countries
7530487 i am writing this while sitting in my studio and

7530511 its not the intent of the charitable check off donations to have a hidden diversion of employee dollars to president strogers pet charities
7530512 the notion is employees get to direct where their hard earned dollars go todd stroger should make donations to his charity and let the employees make donations to the charity they want rather than forcing them to make donations where they might not want their hard earned money to go

7530525 because it is the only city i know where you exit a theater and step right into another one new orleans is a musical playing 365 days a year
7530526 why read about new orleans in history books when you can help create it

7530528 maybe something grows on jabba the hutt and then if falls off and they put it in a jar with some chemical stuff and it turns into a baby hutt

7530559 bisogna sdrammatizzare ma non scherzare per la sconfitta con il ravenna
7530560 purtroppo la partita andata male da questo momento tutta la squadra ha lobbligo di dimenticare questo passo falso e concentrarsi sul primo impegno di campionato ad udine il contrario sarebbe un errore posso dire che malgrado leliminazione abbiamo compreso che questa una squadra con grandissima qualit che ha pagato solo per mancanza di lucidit raramente infatti in una partita si costruiscono tante azioni da gol sono sicuro continua amelia che il palermo sapr reagire la difesa a parte i due gol non abbiamo subito tantissimo la pressione degli avversari
7530561 ad udine non sar una partita facile dice il portiere rosanero perch giochiamo contro una squadra che ha cambiato poco e con meccanismi ben rodati

7530565 weve tried a lot of different approaches but charitable donations seem to be the most effective because it allows people to tap into marketing budgets to benefit the causes and charities they want to support
7530566 its like weve been saying all along the consumer is in control
7530567 philosophically if you really believe that then you have to find ways of providing new ways of providing the assets of our brands that people want to be involved in
7530568 say youre sprint not many people are going to put a sprint logo or a sprint product on their personal page but what if the spring brand has an asset that people want to be involved with on an ongoing basis like the nfl or nascar or music
7530569 we can put three or four assets into social vibe and see how a nascar sponsorship performs or the nfl or something that will connect with consumers in their social media world
7530570 hes a smart kid for sure and i think they have an interesting opportunity and you can see a day down the road when they are able to connect brands with all these micro celebrities in social media it could be the new industry model
7530571 we need to get this matter resolved before the transfer deadline
7530572 if berbatov goes we will need time to sign a replacement we want to have the best centre forward we can possibly get
7530573 this is the first time i have faced this problem as a coach and the truth is i have found it a conflicting situation to be in
7530574 of course what has happened has had repercussions on the team and our results
7530575 against sunderland for instance we were only able to play with one forward and we didnt have any substitutes for that player
7530576 players go through physical problems all the time but in this case its a psychological issue which we have to deal with
7530577 if berbatov works well during the week maybe he will be able to play in our next game if not he wont
7530578 but we cannot make that decision now we can only decide that on the eve of the game
7530579 okay gentlemen dicks sporting goods park rules apply today no fun no smiling anyone found to enjoying themselves will be immediately beaten and ejected from the stadium
7530580 that is the reason why nabil was a key player for us at the weekend i was saying to him stay wide stay wide and he offered the wide areas
7530581 andrea dossena was going forward in the first half and alvaro arbeloa in the second half but really our wingers are not players who play on the lines we have to try through our full backs and keep the other team back
7530582 there were other things off the field that people didnt really know about
7530583 at this precise moment in time i feel i made the right decision i didnt want to do what paul sturrock is trying to do which is rebuild a team
7530584 we started last season with a good team but by the end of the season 13 players would be out of contract
7530585 we kept talking about who we were going to keep and how much we were going to give them they had them on such small contracts which is great management but the players had started to win in the championship and other teams had seen that so they were going to be sought after
7530586 they were going to walk out on bosman rulings wed had it happen the year before when tony capaldi went to cardiff and he told some of his mates how much he was getting
7530587 we inherited a problem at plymouth and i realised the more we were talking about it the more we couldnt solve it and i didnt want to do that any more
7530588 even now i still cant believe how we didnt get one goal in any one of 10 games
7530589 bristol city at home or even stoke on the last day of the season we just needed one goal the chances we missed were unbelievable
7530590 i believe theyre in a better place now and i believe nigels going to take them forward
7530591 the players that they have got there are going to be strong in that division and theyre building every club needs to bottom out and i think they bottomed out last summer
7530592 it was devastating for me because lifes all about timing and that was wrong as it was proved
7530593 but i wish them all the very best their supporters are absolutely outstanding
7530594 at the end of the day if iain dowes given the chance to spend money hes got a proven record of taking a team to the premier league i hope it works for him
7530595 youre talking about new directors and new owners and with the greatest respect to them they have to learn that this is a different business and you have to trust people who know what theyre doing
7530596 it must be difficult for them because theyve got all the money in the world but its about building a spirit within the squad that is strong sometimes that doesnt happen no matter how much money youve got
7530597 i believe iain will do it and im very proud that i was left holding that baby at a time when no one else wanted to
7530598 its a great club and i hope their fans are given what they want which is top flight football again
7530599 its the politics that kills you in management it really does
7530600 you can never really make a decision youve always got to get it through other people youve got your players and youve got your squad but youre never totally and utterly in control
7530601 its everywhere any manager can try to make decisions you can buy a player but if he gets injured then before you know it youve lost your main striker youre not really in control
7530602 what you do is you learn to firefight and you get on with it the clubs ive been at ive always had to do that because ive had limited budgets

7530607 because of the way it can be sliced and diced by the audience
7530608 while nbc is certainly protecting its legacy tv business that isnt necessarily in the short term an unwise thing to do
7530609 its a test to see how much you can put online and how much traffic you can get
7530610 having a good media player is going to be one of the elements that helps to grow online video advertising

7530612 75 of respondents said they are finding a way to skip ads
7530613 advertisers have to be very careful about they way they approach super sharers
7530614 that super sharers are wary of uploading videos is a big issue
7530615 again if the super sharers are having trouble with this theres a big problem

7530675 the crimes for which the accused is paying the penalty today demonstrate that the gesture extended to them was not justified and that it led to the killing of additional innocent citizens the danger posed by the accused was clear after he had already been convicted of murder in the past the need to keep them at a distance from human civilization forever was also self evident after his release the accused demonstrated that the gesture was unjustified and the steep price for this was paid by many israeli families

7530731 the u s intelligence community buckled sooner in 2002 than previously reported to bush administration pressure for data justifying an invasion of iraq
7530732 the documents suggest that the public relations push for war came before the intelligence analysis which then conformed to public positions taken by pentagon and white house officials
7530733 surge is a success in the context of a devastated population in an obliterated nation lacking in the most essential supplies and services a nation where death continues on a shopping spree
7530734 a recently declassified draft of the cias october 2002 white paper on iraqi wmd programs demonstrates that that the white paper long pre dated the compilation of the national intelligence estimate on iraqi capabilities
7530735 bush administration and the tony blair government began acting in concert to build support for an invasion of iraq two to three months earlier than previously understood
7530736 a comparison of the cia draft white paper with its publicly released edition shows that all the changes made were in the nature of strengthening its charges against iraq by inserting additional alarming claims in the manner of an advocacy or public relations document
7530737 the draft and final papers show no evidence of intelligence analysis applied to the information contained august 22 2004
7530738 baghdad for now appears to be drawing a line short of conducting terrorist attacks with conventional or cbw against the united states fearing that exposure of iraqi involvement would provide washington a stronger cause for making war
7530739 iraq probably would attempt clandestine attacks against the u s homeland if baghdad feared an attack that threatened the survival of the regime were imminent or unavoidable or possibly for revenge

7530764 the response from option traders has been interesting especially in the october options where a trader appears to have played against the easy fix rumors
7530765 they may be betting on a low ball takeover they may betting on no takeover or they may be betting on more bad news
7530766 given that lehman october options are pricing in only about a 3 percent chance of its shares dropping below 5 by october 17 expiration there is virtually no chance of a bust of below 2 50 a share
7530767 its clear that this trader is playing this position as a cheap bearish bet
7530768 this too would seem to suggest a very muted outlook for lehman shares even if a bid is forthcoming
7530769 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7530770 yes there is major progress on the issue of the negotiations on the security deal

7530780 enhancing the immune system is essential in helping animals to heal
7530781 with immunologic stimulation so critical to maintaining or enhancing health i believe it is a wise choice to use immunoboost as a therapeutic agent for all kinds of livestock production systems immunoboost is an effective non antibiotic treatment that has come of age and being omri listed it now provides the necessary assurance to organic producers and the veterinarians that service these specialized farms
7530782 immunoboost has recently gained market interest in the organic sector
7530783 its listing by omri comes at a time when antibiotic use is being carefully scrutinized by the industry and its customers with alternatives to antibiotics being sought
7530784 hey boss we havent updated the jrpg formula since 1988 and i think people are starting to notice no one wants to deal with annoying random battles and slow ass level grinds anymore maybe we should try and make something you know new

7530792 to allow more auctioneers to enter the contest and also to highlight the outstanding job markets all over the country do to promote a competitive livestock economy

7530798 inflammation is a major factor in a number of chronic diseases affecting millions of people and can cause an unwanted impact on healthy tissue

7530800 yet food petrol and rents are skyrocketing pensioners are struggling to keep their heads above water
7530801 age pensioners were struggling in may when the federal government handed down its budget and things have deteriorated since then especially in terms of high fuel prices and the flow on effect for the rest of the economy
7530802 a range of other costs have gone up along the way weve already had the treasurer and the prime minister saying they couldnt live on 273 a week
7530803 the question we keep asking is if you cant then why should you expect our oldest and most vulnerable citizens to do so
7530804 there are legitimate questions to ask about what the state government is contributing to their pensioners such as the need for better and more accessible public transport services
7530805 its not just the commonwealth states have responsibilities as well
7530806 there is clearly an argument developing that people living on their own are facing higher cost of living pressures and we welcome the federal initiative
7530807 valign center height 57 gt i have a new email address
7530808 the limited success of existing therapy suggested to us that factors besides erbb2 or proteins that collude with erbb2 might nullify the effects of herceptin and lapatinib
7530809 our results might explain why the strategy of using erbb2 inhibitors alone to treat breast cancers has fallen short
7530810 these findings may also suggest a way to treat patients with advanced erbb2 positive tumors and those whove developed resistance to erbb2 inhibitors an idea that were eager to test
7530811 if erbb2 is the accelerator that makes the car move brk helps shift the gear to gain more speed
7530812 we might need to hit erbb2 expressing cancers with drugs against both erbb2 and brk
7530813 brk does not promote the proliferation of normal cells and its expression in normal tissues is restricted to non proliferating cells
7530814 produce fewer unwanted side effects than targeting other cancer promoting proteins
7530815 we also think that brk would be an ideal clinical marker than could be used to provide both a diagnosis and prognosis for breast cancer
7530816 brk is coamplified with erbb2 to promote proliferation in breast cancer
7530817 antioxidants sit within this tiny trojan horse protecting it from attack from digestive juices in the stomach
7530818 once in the small intestine the nanoparticle gets sticky and bonds to the intestinal wall it then leaks its contents directly into the intestinal cells which allows them to be absorbed directly into the blood stream
7530819 we hope that by mastering this technique drugs and supplements also vulnerable to the digestive process can be better absorbed by the human body
7530820 the lower fertility and growth rates among the creatures exposed to contaminants is probably a stress response
7530821 these crustaceans are sensitive to heavy metals such as copper cadmium and zinc and scientists use them as a test organisms for assessing the toxicity of marine sediments says ms chung
7530822 they accumulate heavy metals inside their tissues and scientists use them to monitor environmental pollutants
7530823 its outrageous my concern is the ethical standards and moral values of an education system that believes it has the right without my permission to get my daughter to put condoms on plastic penises
7530824 if there is a real commitment to protect all children then supporting families and children before they reach the point of being abused and neglected should be a priority
7530825 we already know many of the risk factors for child abuse and neglect and in many cases we could identify many children who are most vulnerable before theyre even born
7530826 the current approach does little to prevent abuse but focuses on intervening once much of the harm has already been done an approach that in my view is both unethical and inhumane
7530827 while urgent action is needed to protect children being abused and neglected we need to broaden adult focussed services such as alcohol and drug treatment mental health corrections homelessness family violence etc so that they can enhance the parenting of their clients
7530828 we also need to use health promotion campaigns with messages such as alcohol and children dont mix given that one in eight australian children now lives in a household with at least one adult who is regularly binge drinking
7530829 child abuse and neglect needs to be attacked in the same comprehensive way we have tackled other serious health issues such as smoking or coronary heart disease that is to identify the risk factors promote a range of interventions and change community attitudes
7530830 despite an optimistic early start to the year trading conditions steadily worsened as higher interest rates and increases in fuel and food prices were felt by consumers
7530831 the remaining problem is how to speed up the deformation rate
7530832 a convenient and direct route to produce particles too small to be easily synthesized by conventional preparation methods
7530833 after nearly seven years of investigation we have developed a body of powerful evidence that allows us to conclude that we have identified the origin and the perpetrator of the 2001 bacillus anthracis mailings

7530835 the impressive finding opens up new unprecedented possibilities in organometallic chemistry
7530836 aggressive management of this infectious disease is feasible and can prevent high mortality rates and further transmission of drug resistant strains of tb
7530837 the reason we have the problem is inadequate control of tb this treatment is extremely labour and resource intensive and has to be done within extremely well structured tb programmes its a very important paper showing its possible to deal with xdr tb but its very expensive
7530838 is there a problem with iphones antenna is the coverage worse than for other mobiles there are many rumors on the internet in the usa someone is going to sue apple we took our iphone to a test chamber for fact finding
7530839 which sells test chambers for wireless devices with small antennas in a noise free metal chamber the mobile communicates with a simulated base station the equipment measures how the mobile sends and receives signals under different conditions for manufacturers and others who want to make a test the test is much faster and more reliable than travelling around to check the performance at different locations
7530840 bluetests chambers are used by among others mobile phone manufacturers such as motorola and tco which has a system for certifying mobiles
7530841 barack obama has chosen one of the most rabid pro music and film industry senators joe biden in the business to be his running mate in the forthcoming presidential elections
7530842 biden has spent most of his career allied with the fbi and copyright holders he ranks toward the bottom of cnets technology voters guide and has come up with some of the worst anti privacy legislation
7530843 biden has been one of hollywood and the recording industrys biggest fans and has been working to expand copyright laws in 2002 he tried to make it a felony to trick certain types of devices into playing unauthorized music or executing unapproved computer programs the law was caned by almost every technology outfit in the land and was quietly dropped
7530844 later he wrote to the justice department demanding that it use taxpayer money to do the work of the riaa and mpaa to drag p2p users into court fortunately this was ignored by the doj
7530845 last year biden sponsored an riaa backed bill aimed at restricting americans ability to record and play back individual songs from satellite and internet radio services this was in support of his chums at the riaa who were suing satellite radio companies at the time
7530846 biden has refused to answer questions on technology this might have something to do with the fact he supports internet taxes and censoring libraries and schools
7530847 ya know since summer started ive been having trouble with bats in my loft and attic at church ive tried everything noise spray cats nothing seems to scare them away

7530883 these online assessments are typically culture fit and motivational tests
7530884 you might find yourself in a job incompatible to your personality type and values
7530885 the more honest you are with these types of tests the better off you are in the long run
7530886 we still bring in the same number of job applicants but we believe we have more of the right kind of talent
7530887 theyre people with a better understanding of what nationwide is
7530888 i might ask them an open ended question about how they would verify they were correctly completing a task at work
7530889 if youve worked as an rn for 20 years at our local hospital i think that youre experienced in fulfilling an organizations expectations regardless of your personality test score
7530890 many of the people there had extensive service time with us and we wanted to make sure they were treated with dignity and respect
7530891 theyre ensuring that employees go out and say yes i lost my job but they gave me this also its proven that if a person goes through an outplacement firm the risk of a lawsuit is reduced dramatically
7530892 im not a young person and my main concern because im in my late 50s was how id be received in the job market
7530893 to hear that we were going to close was heartbreaking
7530894 after speaking with them i realized my leadership skills are transferable
7530895 companies tell us that even though theyre paying people to go to these workshops their productivity doesnt go down even though theyre eventually being laid off
7530896 thats a big concern for companies that make the announcement three months out
7530897 i know im living here but im very willing to move and undertake that on my own if i need to
7530898 richiede pero un cambio culturale completo perche non e facile italianizzare un istituto come quello dellelezione del pubblico ministero negli stati uniti dove questo avviene poi il pubblico ministero il procuratore capo si sceglie lui i suoi sostituti che prende tra i migliori avvocati dice ghedini ha anche un budget dal quale pesca e con il quale paga questi sostituti e ha un budget a cui far fronte per tutte le spese di giustizia quindi e un modello completamente diverso dal nostro ma certamente interessante
7530899 richiederebbe una rivoluzione vera e propria del nostro impianto processuale ma e una proposta di pregio sicuramente un sistema su cui si puo ragionare certamente non un qualche cosa che si possa pensare di inserire a breve termine anche perche ci vuole una modifica costituzionale e una dei codici pero e un sistema che da delle garanzie interessanti
7530900 ritengo che sul tema della giustizia sia doveroso cercare delle convergenze

7530904 the best part was winning that silver medal and being able to perform when i really had to
7530905 overall i think its just whole experience of the games at the beginning i wanted to live the games a different way than i did the other two ive been really trying to connect with the rest of the canadian team in the other sports and meeting more people and interacting with other people and i have and that just made the games a whole lot better the whole games have been just great to me
7530906 the chinese have run a great olympics there have been no problems anywhere theyve just done a first rate job
7530907 i think when we went to the hohai district its kind of the old part of beijing its pretty cool down there pretty interesting to see what beijing was like before all these skyscrapers came along it just looks so old school we walked into the back of the hutongs alley ways where people live we chatted with people through our interpreter i didnt know what to expect when you come to a communist country you might have a preconceived notion but everybody has been so friendly and open and upbeat
7530908 i trained really hard and waited a long time for this competition to come up and i dont think ive realized that it is now over its like i am in a dream right now im really excited i dove awesome so i am just really glad my competition went as well as my training i think beijing is really a big accomplishment for me i have been training my entire life since i was six years old and i dreamt of an olympic medal
7530909 china won many medals i am proud and excited whenever i see the chinese win gold medals i get excited the important thing is the friendship between china and every country in the world whenever canada got a gold medal i felt excited too because i have many good friends from canada
7530910 beijing was a little bit different now than it normally was they really put a lot of effort into cleaning it up and closing down anything they felt was unsightly which is actually part of my favourite parts of beijing when you have all the little tables out in the middle of the street and everyones sitting eating and drinking late into the night and its really quite a gritty passionate place the games have been a little bit more clean and sanitized i hope the old beijing will be back after the games the chinese are obsessed with appearances what they call face they dont want to lose face they want to show the absolute best i often prefer seeing the wide gamut i like the little dark alleys and streets where people still live without sewage they have public washrooms and they walk to them at night and during the day theres a real community feeling there really sort of chaotic the colourful back streets of beijing a lot of beijing to see it properly you really have do on foot or by bicycle to do it exhaustedly would take three or four years
7530911 the sheer numbers of people and the humanity realizing there are so many people and the chinese are a world power i got to see a lot of people and hear their stories
7530912 the chinese economy is moving forward feeding all these people is incredible just to support 1 3 billion people thats a huge amount wed drive for hours and there would be nothing but people and skyscrapers from horizon to horizon you surrender your personal space because theres so many people
7530913 the best moment for me was when carol huyhn got canadas first medal in our sport wrestling i was there to witness it as they played the national anthem it made me feel proud to be canadian
7530914 i made amazing friends here for life and i got to watch the best athletes in the world in other disciplines
7530915 the highlight for me was getting a chance to call beach volleyball because the energy the colour in the stands and just the enthusiasm and the just the grand spectacle of the sport which id never seen at this level before blew me away the whole entertainment package
7530916 it felt very un olympic to me because a lot of the other sports are a little more staid a little more laid back but this was like a rock concert every time we went in there
7530917 its so wonderful to see so many people coming together and sharing one big cultural experience and just celebrating athletics and just personal triumphs and team triumphs its really kind of heart warming to see everyone all together its really special to see anyone win a medal and seeing a dream realized thats what i think is really special you dont understand the full scope of it when you are watching it at home but to be here and see the stadiums and to see everything that is going on is a really big deal
7530918 if the olympics had not been here i dont know if china is a place i would have visited but now that im here i think its amazing its totally different than what i expected i think the olympic atmosphere enhances that it surpasses my expectation the people are amazing they are so helpful and friendly theyve been great its a very cool town
7530919 working at the water cube national aquatics centre and watching american michael phelps win each of his eight gold medals i thought that was absolutely fantastic to watch alex despatie win in the three metre springboard and emilie heymans win a silver at the 10 metre and of course ryan cochranes 1 500 metre swim where he got the bronze it was so uplifting to watch it all unfold in front of me it was a great experience
7530920 i was very glad to be a volunteer it is the most precious experience of my entire life i will remember this experience for ever i think i was very lucky you can learn a lot from experiences like this i met with different people every day i learned from them i helped them i feel a little bit tired but i feel very glad

7530977 at the workshop it was clear to me that the sbtia is concerned about future regulation of ipa
7530978 they are concerned that they have limits on their use of ipa while hospitals are exempt but there has not been a final decision
7530979 is that the solvents being used by businesses will be less reactive meaning they will have less reactive compound
7530980 the use of ipa specifically in hospitals is just needed for sterilization
7530981 we at the district generally regulate emitting devices and processes but we dont see hospitals to fall into those categories
7530982 apcd is saying were regulating you guys because we can while giving the public the impression that business is the main source of solvent use its my opinion that these other exempt sources are the greater sources and they arent even mentioned
7530983 this rule was not intended to limit ipa it was intended to limit other reactive compounds that are used in other solvents
7530984 we are going to take the input we got and do our best to satisfy our mission and understand other peoples positions

7531261 there was discussion about the fact that the market has become increasingly competitive and that for us to be able to continue to maintain our level of competitiveness in australia we need to work with the government on future transitional assistance programs
7531262 mr mulally reiterated the significant investment that ford has made in australia over the past 82 plus years including recent significant investment such as the development of the all new falcon and the fact that australia is the global engineering lead of the corporations next global light pick up truck
7531263 that re emphasised our commitment to australia and that it is an ongoing commitment
7531264 many of the members with children thought how easily this could have happened to one of theirs they wanted to find him no matter what
7531265 he was fascinated by water and had been doing year 9 homework about the ocean rivers fish and waterways he was also about to attend the melbourne aquarium he had never had swimming lessons but on the day he disappeared all sorts of things were being washed down the creek by heavy rain he might have seen something of interest and waded in to try to get it
7531266 yadavs story really touched people we had calls from as far afield as queensland thinking they might have spotted him
7531267 in extremely poor taste and it should not have been used to promote london
7531268 the board considered that while this advertisement does not sexualise children it brings the issue of sex before them
7531269 the board noted that debate within the community about the sexualisation of children has crystallised community concern about the unsolicited exposure of children to advertisements dealing with sexuality
7531270 we need to be direct in our advertising because weve found men dont respond to the message otherwise
7531271 last year the word sex was ok today its not
7531272 its been a fantastic way of engaging students and letting them learn at their own pace in a forum that they are very comfortable with
7531273 children also seem not to perceive working on computers as learning so they really enjoy it
7531274 we agreed with the australian government with the prime minister that we will discuss how we can participate and how the australian government can give us this opportunity
7531275 we have agreed to launch a joint education training and employment initiative which will come back to us with specific recommendations for action by years end
7531276 im delighted to welcome such a diverse group of member companies
7531277 the expansive nature of our membership continues to reflect the transformation of our industry and the broadening of abms footprint
7531278 pelo que sinto prazer nas fraquezas nas inj rias nas necessidades nas persegui es nas ang stias por amor de cristo porque quando estou fraco ent o sou forte
7531279 this is an unconscionable state of affairs and must be investigated
7531280 what i see happening across australia is clustering by gender its almost like a gender divide is opening up
7531281 whereas once people just sat around and waited for mr right or ms right to cross their paths what im saying is thats not necessarily the right strategy any more you might have to move
7531282 women should use their numbers advantage in their 20s to trial and road test potential partners
7531283 but they need to make sure they lock down their quarry into a commitment by 33
7531284 for men on the other hand the strategy is completely different
7531285 no matter how good the offers are in their 20s men should hold out there are even better odds later in life and if they can hold out until 90 there are two girls for every boy
7531286 if there are five blokes to every girl we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa
7531287 i just wonder if legislators have thought about the practicalities on the ground for both centrelink workers and school workers
7531288 the potential for parents to get aggressive and violent over this is huge
7531289 le verbe aimer est difficile conjuguer son pass nest pas simple son pr sent nest quindicatif et son futur est toujours conditionnel
7531290 en amour il y en a toujours un qui souffre et lautre qui sennuie
7531291 le secret du bonheur en amour ce nest pas d tre aveugle mais de savoir fermer les yeux quand il le faut
7531292 i still believe its an advantage if you know how to win a u s
7531293 i think giving a nice chunk of fish to a pet is important to satisfy the personal hedonistic needs of the owner not the nutritional need of the cat
7531294 cats will be very happy to eat the offal from a trout
7531295 if there is ever a point in time that we dont need this water we will simply store it in lake eildon
7531296 providing comparable data on efficiency and quality of care will allow purchasers of health services to legitimately distinguish between effective providers of private health care and less effective providers
7531297 its important to bear in mind that even if the claimants were successful in getting a determination of native title that doesnt mean that the national park stops being a national park
7531298 we gave specific commitments that it would remain as it works now
7531299 we find it amazing that the rudd labor government elected to restore australians rights at work should care so little about the rights of people like charlie joe and ivan and the 900 000 other construction workers in this country
7531300 the government is to be applauded for abiding by its election promises and its about time unions accepted this fact
7531301 we wanted to believe that the horrors of the 1917 revolution and the civil war that followed were completely in the past and that the ussr was now a cultured fully literate and strongly industrialised power most importantly we wanted to believe where anti semitism would not be tolerated
7531302 bad babies law medicine and the battle over neurological birth injury
7531303 the question of what causes cerebral palsy has baffled medical scientists for over a century
7531304 the main culprit was once thought to be too little oxygen getting to a babys brain during birth today most leading experts downplay that explanation though arguing that damage usually occurs well before birth
7531305 yet litigation over cerebral palsy continues plaintiffs typically argue that a doctors negligent management of birth caused the damage
7531306 most judges are very clever people but they are bound by precedent rules the cause and effect issues raised in cerebral palsy cases are just too complex for the rules of negligence law to handle
7531307 the result is dysfunctional doctors especially obstetricians get upset about the baseless claims and the high premiums they must pay for liability insurance most families who live with cerebral palsy on the other hand get no compensation and many struggle to cope
7531308 it should be all encompassing it is a constant battle for families affected by disability to get what they need
7531309 the government sees no reason why that levy cant continue to operate
7531310 the premiers view has been that he sees the continuation of the tax as being appropriate
7531311 in the european union there is a proposal to dedicate the revenue raised from including aviation into the trading scheme towards developing countries mexico has a similar proposal
7531312 it is time for australia to get on board as well this would generate 11 billion by 2020 and that is far better than investing 150 million here and 150 million there
7531313 essentially through this analysis they are seeking to put a carbon pollution wall around several of the big polluters i wont say that i am overwhelmingly confident of businesses support on our proposal but they need to sit back and take a look at the bigger picture
7531314 australia is a good country as a manufacturing and supply chain base for expanding its food business in the asia pacific area
7531315 as the various material costs are increasing expanding the business will help kirin improve efficiency and cut costs
7531316 vogliamo lottare contro la violenza sessuata e il femminicidio per farlo vogliamo dire chi siamo senza mettere distanza tra noi e le altre perch non siamo n estranee n privilegiate e non pretendiamo che una donna sola faccia quello che tutte non riusciamo a fare far smettere la violenza che tutte subiamo il primo obiettivo dunque di agire culturalmente per far smettere il femminicidio vogliamo innanzitutto dire a voce alta che il mestiere pi antico del mondo non la prostituzione ma lo stupro quello del violentatore per questo vogliamo incontrarci con le donne con tutte ovunque pubblicamente
7531317 dear lord let osi be alright cause were really gonna need him this season
7531318 but just in case you see fit to hobble him indefinitely let brett favre s spirit move over michael strahan as we try to talk him out of retirement
7531319 there is no way we could grow the overseas businesses without entering losses
7531320 the game is really to build this listing base which then results in more traffic
7531321 we continue to see a migration from print to online because its much much cheaper
7531322 even over the last half year since the credit crisis hit we have actually seen a significant growth in agent numbers in the uk
7531323 if that were the case it certainly would have happened a lot earlier because mr baker never liked news corp much
7531324 weve been working with a number of parties over the last six weeks to two months to try and pull that forward to the end of 2014 or the start of 2015
7531325 theres absolutely no reason why there should only be one of these plants
7531326 by 2020 i would hope there would be a number of these in place
7531327 at that time we predict a permit price on carbon at 45 per tonne and although we did not go into a detailed analysis of the price of carbon capture and sequestration we felt that it was going to be too expensive at that time
7531328 the review concluded that the rapid expansion in the range of business activities of the company had created a portfolio of businesses that were not well integrated and which in the main lacked critical mass in their chosen market segments
7531329 the use of debt funding in making these acquisitions had also increased the level of gearing which combined with the tighter interest rate environment was negatively impacting the performance and growth prospects of the company this has been exacerbated by adverse trends in consumer and advertiser markets
7531330 capitalised for the needs of the business including for increased working capital
7531331 not cloud the fact that this business will continue to generate significant amounts of cash over the cycle and that we think our dividend policy a 12 a share interim payout was previously declared is appropriate
7531332 where a significant number of customers were not satisfactorily credit managed
7531333 many of these customers were acquired via dealers who received high up front commissions resulting in cash outflows exceeding inflows
7531334 dhs has not been approached by indian authorities about either of these children but will co operate with any request received
7531335 it is a question of balancing the feeling of outrage about a child being taken from its natural parents against the circumstance if it is that the child has been living extremely happily in australia and knows no other environment or family
7531336 we are delighted with anzs approach and that it shares our confidence in the tricom business and the opportunities ahead
7531337 following discussions over the weekend we remain confident we can find a suitable structure between the various stakeholders for tricom to be appropriately capitalised and continue to operate effectively
7531338 the gravity of the issues relating to the equity finance business should have been but was not properly brought to the attention of the chief executive of the board
7531339 organic growth will remain at the centre of our growth strategy in 2008 and 2009 and this will require significant capital expenditure in our regulated business over the next few years
7531340 the asset businesses in our portfolio have experienced steady growth in regulated electricity distribution sales volume of 1 7 above hy 2007 the previous first half
7531341 despite whats happened with mls i really do see it as a bump in the road it doesnt bring the industry to its knees
7531342 in terms of any passing on of the pain if there is any pain to pass on we have spent the last 15 years getting big enough to look after ourselves if a day like today came along
7531343 we are quite comfortable that we will be able to negotiate prices and in effect have already done so in a more tight health insurance market at a level that will allow us to continue to grow our business
7531344 will be a critical gauge of sevens ability to retain viewers post olympics
7531345 were still looking for higher prices next year and in some cases the year after
7531346 the whole cycle that began around the turn of this century has ended
7531347 human ingenuity creates productivity and the real price of almost everything thats extracted or manufactured goes down over time thats the nature of human progress
7531348 that bodes well for a slightly improved consumer sentiment outlook going forward australia just seems to be catching up in that space with the banks announcing some not very pleasant results
7531349 having said that the northern territory and south australia do seem to be relatively better performing economies in the australian region
7531350 even our worst case result in alinta is not a bad situation
7531351 we think shareholder value could be enhanced best by breaking up the remaining assets
7531352 that should eliminate the management fees and fix what we believe is an untenable structure in the alternative there may be a buyer for the business as a going concern
7531353 given the financial position of the company and the leverage in place the risk remains as to how much equity value could be realised out of asset sales should this path be taken
7531354 the question should be asked could bbp stand on its own two feet without the b amp b facility in place in our view no it couldnt
7531355 i suppose leadership at one time meant muscles but today it means getting along with people
7531356 kind words can be short and easy to speak but their echoes are truly endless
7531357 being powerful is like being a lady if you have to tell people you are you arent
7531358 make heroes out of the employees who personify what you want to see in the organisation
7531359 it is not fair to ask of others what you are not willing to do yourself
7531360 the general commentary is that there are no significant cuts taking place certainly among the major buyers
7531361 when things begin to tighten up a little bit more than usual
7531362 if were an arrogant nation theyll resent us if were a humble nation but strong theyll welcome us
7531363 stands alone right now in the world in terms of power
7531364 there is blood everywhere in the unit we have told the police it was you how do you feel about that
7531365 she said she wanted to get a sense of the real me which of course i am working hard to hide
7531366 i listen to his program when i can and i really like him
7531367 did you see when bez kicked that wicked goal dad how cool was that
7531368 the olympic moments that touch your heart and purify your soul belong to those who are fighting destiny triumphing over adversity or proving to the world that love can be as deep as ocean
7531369 if there was an olympic games in international relations and in strategic studies hedley bull would be without doubt a gold medallist an absolute gold medallist
7531370 every nuclear power or potential nuclear power makes an exception in its own case
7531371 it is not widely held in the united states that americas possession of nuclear weapons is a threat to international security in britain that britains is in france that frances is every nation fears the acquisition of nuclear weapons by its enemies more than by its allies
7531372 i hope the decision to allow these students to travel to cyprus will help to legitimise this passage between gaza and cyprus to actually open a route that would allow people here freedom of movement
7531373 its also very significant that this free gaza protest that succeeded in getting here not just be forgotten but rather be the first in a series of steps to break the siege
7531374 ok there has been no killings and injuries from military violence no incursions from the israeli army
7531375 there is an agreement between the two sides that there will be no foreign soldiers in iraq after 2011
7531376 there is a provision that says the withdrawal could be done even before 2011 or extended beyond 2011 depending on the security situation
7531377 ive never experienced an environment like the one weve experienced in the last 12 months
7531378 effectively gives back all but some of the gains that have been generated in the prior two years
7531379 we are not in any way under any pressure to sell assets to raise liquidity or to repay debt which would force us to realise these mark to market losses
7531380 my challenge was to treat bach as a contemporary composer
7531381 before it was too late this is the last time i will record them twice is enough
7531382 the aim is to equip the inmates with skills to make a living after they leave the prison
7531383 the art class is not just a candle but a spotlight which shows me the way i know i will not be jobless out there and will not return to a life of crime
7531384 i dont understand what you mean by street art if it has no permission it is regular destruction and should be punished i think it is equal to destroying someones car
7531385 if there werent as many guaranteed contracts you wouldnt have so many injuries
7531386 gee i love that guy and i want to keep him
7531387 well we love him too but hes not going to perform the way we want him to for the next three years
7531388 yes 82 year old chloris will also shake her grand memaw crotch on the dance floor
7531389 the concept is flexible and the network of the global games industry permits us to be active at different locations after the southeast asian games convention we are now focusing on the north american market
7531390 prns are evidence that waste has been recovered or recycled and theyre big business
7531391 businesses are keen to sell the prns because that absolves them of responsibility for the waste materials and we are keen to acquire them as it affords us access to potentially valuable raw materials
7531392 we currently have a stockpile of around 3 500 tonnes of glass waste and glass is continuing to arrive at a rate of around 1 500 tonnes per month
7531393 we therefore needed a fast effective and reliable way in which to process this material before we were hit with a prn time penalty
7531394 the cone had a habit of producing long shards that contaminated the recycled product
7531395 longer and larger pieces of glass retain heat that prevents the tarmac from solidifying
7531396 in cases where it looks like an officer needs training they direct that it happens in a timely manner
7531397 weve done a major initiative on compliance with seat belts and we attribute that decline to that directive
7531398 just because ive got chipper on the other side and hes leading the league that isnt going to turn my switch on to try to play the game hard
7531399 i play the game hard no matter what no matter whos in town
7531400 its their decision to put me wherever they want to
7531401 obviously when you are the last guy on the team you just want to make people happy
7531402 i think its just a matter of time until he hits hes a good hitter and hes going to hit
7531403 playoff baseball without the yankees or red sox and with the rays and twins would no doubt scare tv executives and delight thousands of baseball fans sick of watching andy pettitte face jason varitek
7531404 we hung in there and battled and definitely deserved to win
7531405 games like this if that doesnt inspire you and get you going and give you a lift i dont think you like to play
7531406 sometimes you have it from the start and sometimes you have to get a feel for it
7531407 i got a guy or two on base and had to find it quick i tried to work out of a jam and was fortunate to get out of it with limited damage
7531408 to prepare as much as you can and watch a lot of video especially their bullpen guys
7531409 god forbid if someone gets hurt you have to be ready to go in right away you have to be ready at any moment other than that the secret to pinch hitting is that it has to be something you want to do
7531410 on a club thats in a playoff race and they have enough respect to call me up
7531411 es por ello que hemos determinado unos requisitos para los profesores en los que se incluye el lugar de residencia de los aspirantes
7531412 if we dont reverse our accommodative stance sooner rather than later
7531413 we will face rising inflation which may be costly to deal with and we will face a risk to the feds credibility to contain inflation
7531414 if i did or said something that hurt you im sorry
7531415 indeed the very presence of this cluster confirms the existence of a mysterious component of the universe called dark energy
7531416 such massive galaxy clusters are thought to be rare objects in the distant universe they can be used to test cosmological theories
7531417 the existence of the cluster can only be explained with dark energy
7531418 according to the current cosmological theories we should only expect to find this one cluster in the 1 of sky that we have searched
7531419 companies are land locked near central city is really tight so people are moving north where theres more opportunity
7531420 its a growing economy and a growing business needs more and more room
7531421 for industrial projects theres a limited amount of industrially zoned land and there is a good amount in north fort worth and its relatively well priced industrial land
7531422 our area is somewhat underdeveloped in that we have a lot of land available which attracts a lot of larger companies that need a lot of space like barnett shale companies and trucking companies
7531423 they need to be able to store equipment and trucks and that sort of thing and that takes a lot of space
7531424 as their business grows they can move into larger space you cant find that in the city here you can lease as much or as little as you want and still have access to outside storage but in the city you can find that outside storage but it comes with a set amount of office warehouse space you get what you get
7531425 it was a good amount of land that would take care of future expansions plus it has good egress and ingress
7531426 we go all over tarrant county and being able to get around 820 is pretty advantageous traffic is getting extremely heavy along i 35 and we identified about four ways that we can get to this new property
7531427 the appetite in this community for regional commuter rail is very very high
7531428 our transportation department in texas has been way too much about highway building and not nearly enough about alternative modes of transportation i think weve got to begin a very serious dialogue about making sure that all of those systems are funded and planned and integrated in a way that it works well and provides options for people
7531429 were working on the north tarrant express with txdot and the comprehensive development agreements to make sure they stay on line and they get done on time
7531430 we were successful in getting the 161 extension of the george bush turnpike settled about two months ago and making sure that contract was resolved between the north texas tollway authority and txdot
7531431 i carried legislation to keep the cement kilns from emitting as much carcinogens as they have in the past we passed it in the senate however it died in the house
7531432 were continuing to find ways to take care of this
7531433 primarily the real concern for north texas because of the direction of the wind is the midlothian cement plants
7531434 at the state level i think txdot from this point forward any highway project theyre involved in they should have clean cement purchasing power
7531435 having said that though i also recognize when youre asking an industry to impose a pretty high cost on doing business its important for the state to look at being a partner in helping to make that happen
7531436 in holding the positions i have for tarrant county and my committee assignments and being able to pass all the legislation that the local governments ask me to pass are paramount reasons i should return for my fourth session in the senate
7531437 what i would say sets me apart most dramatically from kim brimer is that i have a demonstrated history of being that kind of representative and he has a demonstrated history of being the kind of representative that works on behalf of special interests without care or concern for the consequences on the community he represents
7531438 i am proud to have served residents of tarrant county for over 20 years i consider it an honor and a privilege to do so
7531439 if i have an eligible opponent on the ballot i look forward to an exciting and vigorous campaign
7531440 and name brand outfits for 2 you can find good deals and its really worth it why pay full price
7531441 the sales are crazy moms are digging in bins and on their knees sifting through books or movies but boy does everyone love it who doesnt love a good deal
7531442 at the public sale where children are welcome youll see a child sitting in a wagon buried under a pile of clothes
7531443 our shoe department was my kitchen counter we were thinking about 15 or 20 people would show up but we had 34 consigners and a lot more shoppers i had to trim the trees in my backyard and we got some tents to put up back there
7531444 some people come for one big ticket item a baby bed or an outside play set
7531445 and if they volunteer they shop before anyone else so theyre more likely to get what theyre after
7531446 we do the money donation but our consigners are the ones donating their unsold items
7531447 so everyone is helping and everyone benefits those in need get donated items and clothes and consigners get more storage space in their attics
7531448 ive even done it you go to a yard sale and find someone whos selling their baby clothes for 25 cents each and turn around and sell them at just between friends for 3 each theres a business in it
7531449 it speaks well for our institutions consciousness in preventing an otherwise needless waste
7531450 whenever theres a bunch of people here at one time it gets crazy you have people bumping into you so if youre balancing stuff youre going to end up dropping something or breaking something
7531451 so if a college is looking to go green they need to start looking in the dining facility
7531452 its going faster in some places than others because you have different cultures and different ways that universities do things
7531453 i think its just about as good of a working environment as you can have
7531454 i started officially loading trucks on the night shift at the produce warehouse in dallas
7531455 from there i worked in frozen foods helped on a produce truck filled in for salesmen who were on vacation
7531456 we made the decision that we did not believe we could have a long term future just being in the produce industry
7531457 so we set out to become what is now called a broadline food service distributor
7531458 there is no lack of competition in the food industry beer is the same way
7531459 our brands compete against miller and coors and against all different varieties of craft brands and imports that are handed by other distributors
7531460 we have better people who genuinely care about our customers and they are about their business we have very good competitors but we think were a notch above
7531461 we feel like we try to put a lot more emphasis on customer care than competitors do
7531462 sysco the name itself stands for systems company and thats what they are
7531463 im not trying to in any way run down sysco theyre a very fine company and also very successful but they are a very systems driven company and we are a customer driven company as customers do better we do better
7531464 right now we are distributors but this capability youre actually kind of a semi manufacturer you might say
7531465 youll take in the raw product and cut it to specifications
7531466 i am jairus of the guild of scholars i am here to discuss something with you can we go inside
7531467 what i have to tell you must be kept in the utmost secrecy discussing it out here would not be wise there is far too great a chance that someone to whom i do not wish this information to be spread to may hear our conversation now please let us step inside
7531468 it involves your son but what i am about to say cannot risk being heard by other ears
7531469 its a silence cube it prevents others from hearing what we discuss and prevents their entry until we are done it is also partially connected to your sons disappearance
7531470 we are beginning a plan that will stir things up as the youth of the islands would say
7531471 but it is not a war between the islands it is a war against our captors it is our intent to disturb their research and draw their attention away from our real efforts which will ensure our freedom from captivity once and for all
7531472 and how am i supposed to believe that what youre telling me isnt some big fish tale
7531473 ive already demonstrated technology far beyond our capabilities this is not some elaborate ruse or some cruel joke done in bad taste no this is very real
7531474 well then if its real why are you telling me this what is it you want from me
7531475 we could have asked someone else to help us on our mission against our captors however we chose you
7531476 wait what youre mad my son is dead everyone knows that
7531477 your son is alive and well to the best of our knowledge he is being held captive at a facility several thousand miles to the east of here we dont know his current status but we believe that he is safe for the moment
7531478 alright ill join your little war if theres even the slightest chance of getting my son back alive ill take it but if i find that youve lied to me i will make sure to feed you to the great black fish myself
7531479 the only reward i want is the return of my son now what do you want me to do
7531480 we are going to attack the black fish tomorrow we would like the use of your boat to take us out there to the barrier to engage the fish
7531481 the great black fish you actually want to challenge them
7531482 the great black fish are not fish at all they are something known as a submarine a boat that can sail under water
7531483 in order for this to work we need a way to sneak onto your ship unseen
7531484 the fish tank is the last place anyone would look for a stowaway my brother doesnt even check it in the mornings if you slipped on my boat and got down into the fish tank before the first watch of the morning i could come in at my usual time around the second watch and take the boat out over the horizon after that i let you out and we can start our little fight
7531485 i could put forty big strapping men in there and still have room to spare
7531486 then i and a companion would have no problem staying in it
7531487 not at all but id bring something to cover your face the tank reeks of fish
7531488 thats a pretty crazy list im not sure we can get all of this

7531534 ive seen you do that before i just didnt think youd do it at that point in the game
7531535 i think we have this assumption in the west that capitalism that free markets lead to free societies that capitalism will lead to democracy in china that its almost an automatic process once income levels reach a certain level there that this political change is going to happen in china just as it did in other parts of the world my argument would be that its not automatic certainly weve seen 30 years now of strong economic growth and the communist party is arguably stronger now than it has been ever in these past 30 years the party has been able to use capitalism to strengthen its hold on power at the same time though the party has retreated in many ways people have much more personal freedom than ever before because so many people have been lifted out of poverty they have many more options in life so its a mixed picture but i think it would be na ve for policy makers to assume that this is going to be an automatic process that we just have to continue to trade with china and the political change is just going to happen

7531600 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
7531601 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
7531602 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together

7531622 when truman boarded a train january 1953 at union station without a penny in federal largesse except a microscopic army pension the president knew he would have to sell some property and would even have to dip into his own pocket to buy stamps to answer the 72 000 pieces of mail he received in just the first two weeks after he left the white house
7531623 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
7531624 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
7531625 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily
7531626 john mccain would be stronger against gore gore will be a dull unspiring loser candidate for the democrats mccain looks stronger he is stronger mccain because of his military service and vietnam prisoner of war hero status you know he had a hehluva military record

7531659 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7531660 whether someone helps win you an election i think is kind of a side benefit you certainly want to pick someone who doesnt hurt you
7531661 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7531662 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7531663 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7531664 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7531665 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
7531666 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
7531667 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7531668 with the possible exception of al gore i cant think of someone who generates as much excitement
7531669 mccain was the same for nearly seventy years then he changed
7531670 claiming that mccain suddenly transformed into a different bad man is not plausible
7531671 launching implausible negative attacks is not the new politics weve been promised
7531672 its not just something biden is making up back during the primaries i remember talking to a lot of people about how i thought the 2000 version of mccain might have made a pretty good president but the 2008 model not so much but then the 2000 version would never have won the republican nomination which is why he moved so far to the right
7531673 i think bidens gaffes tend to be pretty superficial they dont reflect a fundamental lack of knowledge or empathy far from it so much as a certain ham fistedness in putting words together this is almost entirely forgivable and unlikely to create long term problems
7531674 i voted for the bill before i voted against it
7531675 family is shaping the content of the entire day and thats not been done before
7531676 he let me know the world was large and that i should get to know as much of it as possible
7531677 they want to contrast the story of obama who has been through struggles that many americans are now facing with mccain who seems increasingly out of touch
7531678 filled with black rage against white people and hatred of the united states
7531679 the challenge is to avoid anything that smacks of angry black woman and get her back into the kitchen the question is whether she is willing to go along with that
7531680 she is bright and she is gifted but she also has a healthily ordinary attitude towards her family that american voters will respond to
7531681 make people aware of the kind of sacrifice barack made to give a voice to people who had all but given up hope
7531682 a nashville based free market think tank and watchdog organization
7531683 its easy i think of a man and i take away reason and accountability
7531684 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
7531685 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
7531686 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7531687 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7531688 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7531689 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7531690 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7531691 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7531692 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7531693 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7531694 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7531695 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain

7531699 my goal was to bring myself and my personality into this project
7531700 it wasnt as bad as i thought it would be
7531701 i was a little nervous because i hadnt seen or talked to her in 14 years everyone was making it out to be such a big deal that i think we both fell prey to having that affect us
7531702 im not much of a small talker and i dont think she is either
7531703 pakistans president pervez musharraf the dictator who reinvented himself as a u s ally against terrorism resigned to avoid facing impeachment charges for illegally seizing power and mishandling the economy
7531704 judge denies mans bid for new trial says deputies didnt intimidate jurors
7531705 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope
7531706 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling
7531707 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7531708 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7531709 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7531710 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean
7531711 i mean thats a storybook man not a fairy tale
7531712 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
7531713 and neither do we since noone wants to be on the ticket with me
7531714 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7531715 the mainstream media has frankly put the security of our great country at risk with an obama coronation media like cnn amp msnbc is the only way obama managed to steal the dem nom its extremely concerning that so many americans could care less about who their candidate really is simply amazing and frankly scarey
7531716 i know ill pick the guy that doesnt endorse me thatll throw em off
7531717 leader who is ready to step in and be president
7531718 secondly do you want to live in a one party state because i have a few suggestions if so
7531719 last night biden wanted to leave his driveway and drive straight to the white house and tell bush paraphrasing that he knows what the world needs
7531720 i dont know if you are aware that i am a decorated vietnam war veteran
7531721 that global warming is unequivocal and that human activity is the main driver very likely causing most of the rise in temperatures since 1950
7531722 with ties to the oil and gas coal and timber industries
7531723 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
7531724 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
7531725 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7531726 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7531727 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7531728 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7531729 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7531730 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7531731 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7531732 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7531733 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7531734 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7531735 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7531736 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7531737 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
7531738 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7531739 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7531740 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7531741 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7531742 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7531743 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7531744 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7531745 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7531746 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7531747 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7531748 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7531749 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7531750 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
7531751 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7531752 c est moi qui ait raison les autres sont dans lerreur voir pire
7531753 los estados partes garantizar n al ni o que este en condiciones de formarse un juicio propio el derecho de expresar su opini n libremente en todos los asuntos que lo afectan teniendo debidamente en cuenta sus opiniones en funci n de su edad y madurez
7531754 not as bad as some of the guys that hit every play like the safeties
7531755 ive got losses from last year i still cant get over
7531756 el amor es el castigo que se nos impone a los que no sabemos estar solos
7531757 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7531758 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7531759 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
7531760 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7531761 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7531762 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7531763 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
7531764 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
7531765 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
7531766 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
7531767 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
7531768 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
7531769 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
7531770 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
7531771 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
7531772 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
7531773 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
7531774 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
7531775 and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7531776 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
7531777 however nothing rallies the righties like a clinton a recent poll showed 49 of americans would never vote for hillary
7531778 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
7531779 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
7531780 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7531781 this is a message of defiance to the international community we call on the unamid peacekeepers to do their job and defend the idps internally displaced persons
7531782 we therefore feel that these repeated defaults and violations have forced us to withdraw our support from the ruling coalition and sit on the opposition benches
7531783 onbemande vliegtuigen zoals de zephyr 6 vormen volgens het britse defensiebedrijf qinetiq een ideaal platform voor verkenningsvluchten en communicatieverbindingen op het slagveld
7531784 qinetiq voert aan dat deze onbemande vliegtuigen heel wat voordelen hebben tegenover traditionele vliegtuigen en zelfs satellieten

7531796 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
7531797 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
7531798 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
7531799 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
7531800 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
7531801 whats great about this attraction is that anyone can do it

7531809 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
7531810 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
7531811 at least i dont cake on the makeup like a trollop you c t
7531812 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
7531813 ladies and gentleman the coverage of barack obama was embarrassing
7531814 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7531815 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7531816 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7531817 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7531818 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7531819 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7531820 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7531821 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7531822 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
7531823 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
7531824 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
7531825 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7531826 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7531827 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7531828 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7531829 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7531830 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7531831 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7531832 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7531833 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7531834 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7531835 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7531836 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7531837 ik zie danny als een aanvallende middenvelder die ook op de flanken uit de voeten kan ik beschouw hem als de beste middenvelder uit de russische competitie we volgden hem al een tijdje
7531838 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
7531839 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government

7531843 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7531844 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7531845 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7531846 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7531847 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7531848 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign

7531859 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7531860 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7531861 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7531862 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes

7531884 no sharp line can be drawn between scientific technique and traditional arts and crafts the essential characteristic of scientific technique is the utilization of natural forces in ways not evident to the totally uninstructed
7531885 as we approach modern times the changes deliberately brought about in social structure become greater this is especially the case where revolutions are concerned the american revolution and the french revolution deliberately created certain societies with certain characteristics but in the main these characteristics were political and their effects in other directions formed no part of the primary intentions of the revolutionaries but scientific technique has so enormously increased the power of governments that it has now become possible to produce much more profound and intimate changes in social structure than any that were contemplated by jefferson or robespierre science first taught us to create machines it is now teaching us by mendelian breeding and experimental embryology to create new plants and animals there can be little doubt that similar methods will before long give us power within wide limits to create new human individuals differing in predetermined ways from the individuals produced by unaided nature and by means of psychological and economic technique it is becoming possible to create societies as artificial as the steam engine and as different from anything that would grow up of its own accord without deliberate intention on the part of human agents such artificial societies will of course until social science is much more perfected than it is at present have many unintended characteristics even if their creators succeed in giving them all the characteristics that were intended the unintended characteristics may easily prove more important than those that were foreseen and may cause the artificially constructed societies to break down in one way or another but i do not think it is open to doubt that the artificial creation of societies will continue and increase so long as scientific technique persists the pleasure in planned construction is one of the most powerful motives in men who combine intelligence with energy whatever can be constructed according to a plan such men will endeavour to construct so long as the technique for creating a new type of society exists there will be men seeking to employ this technique they are likely to suppose themselves actuated by some idealistic motive and it is possible that such motives may play a part in determining what sort of society they shall aim at creating but the desire to create is not itself idealistic since it is a form of the love of power and while the power to create exists there will be men desirous of using this power even if unaided nature would produce a better result than any that can be brought about by deliberate intention
7531886 there are in the world at the present time two powers which illustrate the possibility of artificial creation the two powers in question are japan and soviet russia
7531887 modern japan 1930 is almost exactly what it was intended to be by the men who made the revolution in 1867 this is one of the most remarkable political achievements in all history in spite of the fact that the purpose which inspired the innovators was simple and such as every japanese might be expected to sympathize with the purpose was in fact nothing more recondite than the preservation of national independence china had been found impotent to resist the western powers and japan appeared to be in like case certain japanese statesman perceived that the military and naval power of the western nations rested upon western education and western industrial technique they decided to introduce both with such modifications as japanese history and circumstances demanded but whereas industrialism had grown up in the west with very little assistance from the state and scientific knowledge had developed very far before the western governments undertook the task of universal education japan being pressed for time was obliged to impose education and science and industrialism by governmental pressure it was clearly impossible to effect so great a change in the mentality of the average citizen by mere appeals to reason and self interest the reformers therefore skilfully enlisted the divine person of the mikado and the divine authority of the shinto religion on the side of modern science the mikado had been for centuries obscure and unimportant but he had already been restored to power once before in the year a d 645 so that there was a precedent of respectable antiquity for what was being done the shinto religion unlike buddhism was indigenous to japan but had been for ages thrust into the background by the foreign religion imported from china and korea the reformers very wisely decided that in introducing christian military technique they would not attempt to introduce the theology with which it had hitherto been correlated but would have a nationalistic theology of their own shinto as now taught by the state in japan is a powerful weapon of nationalism its gods are japanese and its cosmogony teaches that japan was created sooner than other countries the mikado is descended from the sun goddess and is therefore superior to the mere earthly rulers of other states shinto as now taught is so different from the old indigenous beliefs that competent students have described it as a new religion as a result of this skilful combination of enlightened technique with unenlightened theology the japanese have succeeded not merely in repelling the western menace but in becoming one of the great powers and achieving the third place on the sea japan has shown extraordinary sagacity in the adaptation of science to political needs science as an intellectual force is sceptical and somewhat destructive of social coherence while as a technical force it has precisely the opposite qualities the technical developments due to science have increased the size and intensity of organizations and have more particularly greatly augmented the power of governments governments have therefore good reason to be friendly to science so long as it can be kept from dangerous and subversive speculations in the main the men of science have shown themselves amenable the state favours one set of superstitions in japan and another in the west but the scientists both in japan and of the west have with some exceptions been willing to acquiesce in governmental doctrines because most of them are citizens first and servants of truth only in the second place in spite of the extraordinary success of japanese policy there are certain unintended effects which are likely in time to cause serious difficulties the sudden change of habits and of conscious opinions has induced a certain nervous strain at any rate in the urban part of the population this may produce a tendency to hysteria in time of national stress indeed such a tendency was shown in the massacres of koreans that occurred after the earthquake of tokio what is more serious the position of japan demands the growth of both industrialism and armaments owing to the expense of the latter the industrial workers are poor they tend consequently to acquire a rebellious mentality and the circumstances of their work make it difficult for them to preserve that close family organization upon which japanese society is built if japan should become engaged in an unsuccessful war these stances might produce a revolution analogous to the russian revolution the present social structure in japan is likely therefore in time to become unstable but it may be that the same skill which has rendered possible the triumphant career of japan throughout the last seventy years will enable the japanese to adapt themselves to changing circumstances gradually without any violent upheaval the one thing that seems fairly certain is that whether gradually or by revolution the social structure in japan will have to be profoundly modified remarkable as it is therefore it is not a perfect example of scientific construction i do not mean by this that it could have been bettered at the time but only that it is not in all respects a model for the future
7531888 the attempt at scientific construction which is being made by the soviet government is more ambitious than that which was carried through by the japanese innovators in 1867 it aims at a much greater change in social institutions and at the creation of a society far more different from anything previously known than is that of japan

7531993 although we have seen improved unctioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force some weeks before our last meeting here in jackson hole has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment add to this mix a jump in inflation in part the product of a global commodity boom and the result has been one of the most challenging economic and policy environments in memory
7531994 if not reversed these developments together with a pace of growth that is likely to fall short of potential for a time should lead inflation to moderate later this year and next

7532031 cancer doctors you see are really in the business of keeping patients ignorant and uneducated corralling them into barbaric treatments that benefit themselves not their patients while applegate has now lost both breasts and undergone an extremely painful barbaric surgical procedure her cancer doctors have collected enormous sums of cash that they charged her the doctors walk home rich but women walk home maimed and still susceptible to recurring cancer is that really the best modern medicine can offer the answer is yes if you limit yourself to drugs and surgery to get something better you have to turn to advanced natural medicine where anti cancer nutrients are found everywhere in foods herbs and nature
7532032 the cancer industry today operates like society in the 1850s its a male dominated system run by people who exploit women for their own selfish reasons following the womens suffrage movement as new rights started to become available to women more and more women began to attend universities education empowered women with new choices and with that power they were able to rise to new positions of power both in the home and the workplace
7532033 modern medicine wishes to keep women trapped in a system of ignorance and enslavement telling women they need to cut off both breasts to treat cancer is like demanding they stay at home barefoot and pregnant serving as little more than servants of their men

7532040 a diferencia del 2003 no s lo tengo la misma ilusi n o m s sino que adem s tenemos la experiencia y la legimitidad que nos da el hecho de haber superado el voto de censura que yo entend como un voto de castigo en efecto ha habido errores y ha habido buenos momentos y concluyo que hemos de estar y aguantar en ambas circunstancias

7532063 true faith constrains a man to live unto the lord from a deep sense of gratitude for redemption it makes him feel that he can never do too much for him who died for him
7532064 in short where there is no sanctification of life there is no real faith in christ true faith worketh by love it constrains a man to live unto the lord from a deep sense of gratitude for redemption it makes him feel that he can never do too much for him who died for him being much forgiven he loves much a regeneration which man can have and yet live carelessly in sin or worldliness is a regeneration invented by uninspired theologians but never mentioned in scripture the spirit never lies dormant and idle within the soul he always makes his presence known by the fruit he causes to be borne in heart character and life

7532068 in a time of hype telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
7532069 the us money supply has experienced the sharpest contraction in modern history heightening the risk of a
7532070 monthly data for july show that the broad money growth has almost collapsed
7532071 the overall debt burden in the us economy is currently at record levels raising concerns that a recession if it occurs could set off a sharp downward spiral
7532072 the biggest one month fall since modern records began in 1959 the process is accelerating and will require the fed to slash rates at its september meeting
7532073 over time inflation will be the last problem that the fed will have to face as a severe us recession and global slowdown will lead to a sharp reduction in inflationary pressures in the u s slack in goods markets with demand falling below supply will reduce pricing power of firms slack in labor markets with unemployment rising will reduce wage pressures and labor costs pressures a fall in commodity prices of the order of 30 will further reduce inflationary pressure the fed will have to cut the fed funds rate much more as severe downside risks to growth and to financial stability will dominate any short term upward inflationary pressures leaving aside the risk of a collapse of the us dollar given this easier monetary policy the fed funds rate may end up being closer to 0 than 1 by the end of this financial crisis and severe recession cycle
7532074 recent government statistics show that only between 10 and 20 of the rebate dollars were spent the rebates added nearly 80 billion to the permanent national debt but less than 20 billion to consumer spending here are the facts tax rebates of 78 billion arrived in the second quarter of the year the governments recent gdp figures show that the level of consumer outlays only rose by an extra 12 billion or 15 of the lost revenue the rest went into savings including the paydown of debt consumer outlays increased to 36 billion from 24 billion so the additional 12 billion of consumer spending was less than 16 of the extra 76 billion of by comparison savings rose by 62 billion or five times as much this experience confirms earlier studies showing that one time tax rebates are not a cost effective way to increase economic activity
7532075 the recent plunge in m3 ed m3 is the broadest measure of money used by economists to estimate the entire supply of money makes it likely that credit lines have been fully tapped and or banks have simply turned off the spigot liquidity shrinks by the day banks scrambling to refinance long term debt are going to have a very tough go of it weekly unemployment claims are soaring consumers out of a job are going to have a tough time paying bills those looking for a bottom in these conditions are simply barking up the wrong tree
7532076 the problem began in the roaring twenties when the fed made money plentiful by keeping interest rates low money seemed to be plentiful but what was actually flowing freely was credit or debt production was up more than wages so more goods were available than money to pay for them but people could borrow money was so easy to get that people were borrowing just to invest taking out short term low interest loans that were readily available from the banks
7532077 the fed began selling securities in the open market reducing the money supply by reducing the reserves available for backing loans the result was a huge liquidity squeeze a lack of available money short term loans suddenly became available only at much higher interest rates making buying stock on margin much less attractive as fewer people bought stock prices fell removing the incentive for new buyers to purchase stocks bought by earlier buyers on margin the stock market crashed overnight

7532088 i dont think ombudsmen are a panacea to all the challenges this new digital age is throwing up
7532089 but i think a refusal to have some kind of independent system embedded within news organisations as we all come under more and more intense scrutiny looks increasingly odd
7532090 i was wrong one or two newspapers have opened little chinks into what they do the bbc has moved a long way

7532186 nato russian relations will need to take fully into account the implications of russian military actions in georgia
7532187 however we believe it would be a mistake to suspend all nato russia contacts when they are so much needed

7532189 we regret that this vote will only add tension in the region
7532190 we call on russia to live up to its commitments and refrain from acts which may further raise already very high levels of tension

7532195 there can be no patriotism without permanent opposition and criticism
7532196 this changes the strategic relationship between the us and poland there is a clear and explicit understanding that if there are negative consequences of stationing the missile shield the us will come to polands defense
7532197 in no way is the presidents plan for missile defense aimed at russia its to protect our european allies from any rogue threats
7532198 the strategic significance of the system consists of intercepting those few dozen missiles moscow can launch following a first strike its a crucial element to develop a nuclear first strike capacity against russia the original plan is for ten interceptor missiles in poland but once established their number could be easily increased

7532206 the dark days of communist yore and captures the threat of what we and russias neighbors are up against
7532207 very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
7532208 immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
7532209 nato can act to stabiliz e this very dangerous situation
7532210 now is the time for action not just words russia must halt its violation of georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia with international monitors to verify that these obligations are met

7532220 kremlin capitalism is a threat to the west by using its market strength in oil and gas resources to strong arm its neighbors and outmaneuver the us and eu
7532221 is to replace a pro western government with a new russian satellite reminiscent of the brezhnev doctrine its part of a broader campaign to annex new territory expand the russian empire conduct cyber attacks against the baltic states assassinate enemies and use economic intimidation through cutoffs of russian oil and gas shipments to ukraine and the czech republic it is important that moscow pays a concrete and tangible price for its latest aggression at least comparable to what it paid for the 1979 invasion of afghanistan
7532222 burned and houses broken unburied bodies lay rotting fresh graves were dug in gardens and basements most victims interviewed were ethnic georgians in central georgian villages some killings were carried out for revenge some involved theft and still others seemed to be that the power balance was shifting away from ethnic georgians to the ossetian separatists and their russian backers
7532223 georgians living in several of the villages said the russians occupying their land had treated them well done nothing to encourage them to leave and offered the only protection available from the south ossestian militias they feared most
7532224 us sees much to fear in a hostile russia by usher ing in a sustained period of renewed animosity with the west problems extend ing far beyond arms deals with syria and the mountains of georgia

7532228 russia is always with you and will never leave you in the lurch
7532229 the kremlin is nearing formal recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia possibly as early as next week
7532230 support is likely and that after all the events that have occurred one should not expect otherwise
7532231 appealed to russia and to governments of other countries to recognize abkhazias independence
7532232 express such a will and if the russian president makes a relevant decision on this score
7532233 again said they will never agree to remain within georgia
7532234 in accordance with the international agreements to their previous places of deployment
7532235 envisaged in the international agreement poti is outside of the security zone
7532236 but that does not mean we will sit behind a fence watching them riding around in hummers
7532237 we have registered an increase in georgian reconnaissance activities and preparations for armed actions in the georgian south ossetian conflict zone
7532238 temporarily suspending military cooperation with nato until a political decision on relations
7532239 now we see russian forces which responded to attacks on russian peacekeepers in south ossetia legitimately
7532240 local s ossetian and abkhazian population said they fear georgia might repeat its regional aggression they also want russian troops to stay in the area to shield them from any possible attacks

7532279 russias historic role of the guarantor of piece in the caucasus has increased said boris gryzlov speaker of the lower chamber following the vote
7532280 the caucasus has always been and will remain the zone of russias strategic interests
7532281 we consider this decision another step in russias fight against georgian sovereignty
7532282 it is and will be if accepted by the russian president a continuation of russian aggression against georgia and a serious violation of international law
7532283 i see no real importance from the legal point of view that this decision may have for the future of abkhazia and south ossetia
7532284 abkhazia and south ossetia cannot become independent states just as a result of the russian parliaments decision
7532285 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will ever again live in one state with georgia
7532286 we will take any decision including up to a complete break in relations if nato countries decide to suspend co operation with russia
7532287 there has been a dramatic worsening of our relations with nato but we are not to blame
7532288 we would like to have a full fledged relationship and partnership but we dont need the illusion of a partnership

7532317 die entscheidung die aktuellen produkte bis auf weiteres nicht ber den appstore zu verbreiten sondern ber eigene
7532318 wir arbeiten derzeit sehr konzentriert an applikationen f r diese plattform und bringen aktualisierungen in einem takt den der appstore derzeit einfach nicht verkraftet ganz offensichtlich ist man in cupertino dem ansturm nicht gewachsen und k mpft zudem auch noch mit politischen mitteln
7532319 es ist jedoch absehbar dass produkte von tobit software auch im appstore verf gbar sein werden entweder weil die entwicklungszyklen l nger werden oder apple den appstore offener gestaltet
7532320 das hochkar tige programm haben wir ganz auf den bedarf der entscheider und anwender zugeschnitten

7532366 lawyers for the detainees have done a great job painting their clients as innocent victims of u s abuse when the fact is that these detainees as a group are barbaric and extremely dangerous
7532367 they are using their terrorist training on the battlefield to abuse our guards and manipulate our congress and our court system
7532368 they have a lot of cultural biases about females and we let them know in our culture that females do everything males do in a professional job environment and we just hold firm
7532369 it happens from time to time at facilities here but it seems the majority of assaults at gitmo were either spitting or bodily fluids being thrown on the guards

7532371 we were arrested and taken to a university for questioning we were held for nearly 24 hours without any sleep and were interrogated for up to about eight hours
7532372 then we were moved to a detention centre and before we were allowed any sleep we had another 12 hours of interrogation
7532373 the guys i was with were given the reason that it was illegal to undertake even a peaceful protest and to talk about the situation in tibet
7532374 they seemed to have decided to really clamp down on protesters

7532393 nato russian relations will need to take fully into account the implications of russian military actions in georgia
7532394 however we believe it would be a mistake to suspend all nato russia contacts when they are so much needed
7532395 we are ready to accept any decision up to halting relations altogether
7532396 we regret that this vote will only add tension in the region
7532397 we call on russia to live up to its commitments and refrain from acts which may further raise already very high levels of tension
7532398 this move can only raise suspicions about russias motives and aims coming after news of continued russian military activity in senaki and poti

7532402 the blacks are putting together cognitive sentences fuck were doomed
7532403 the demise of black people has been ridiculed more than that of any other
7532404 i mentioned the assimilation into the white world because i read somewhere on this post that hr will overlook anyone with a different name give white people some credit they wont
7532405 cnn a new zealand judge has made a 9 year old girl a ward of the court so that her name can be changed from talula does the hula from hawaii the countrys national news agency reported thursday

7532407 i manage to escape the poverty stricken mindset in terms of boisterous behavior and the new status marks tattoos thats our ghetto poverty stricken influence refusing to be silenced
7532408 plenty of blacks elsewhere specifically africa and the caribbean have european names since they were colonized how many us of know west indians named ethan and nigel or how about africans named pierre dieudonne guy and francois

7532415 we built our homes out of palm leaves i saw animals id never seen before he taught me the medicinal properties of all the plants we picked fruit off the trees we swam with and ate piranhas and of course we had sex for almost two weeks
7532416 i got to stay in the jungle and he got to have sex with a cute young american girl
7532417 its more about getting what you want than getting what you need
7532418 unless you think everyone needs a 200 louis vuitton bag
7532419 women are turned on just by the simple idea of their guy getting off his ass and doing something for them
7532420 give it to me first thing in the morning and ill play handyman all day
7532421 theyll touch my hand and theres all this physical contact or theyll run around in their pajamas
7532422 i was painting the hallway right outside a clients bedroom and she was lying on her bed like a girl at a slumber party with her legs up and her arms crossed and her head resting on them asking me if i had a girlfriend
7532423 its all about the fantasy of being taken by the rough hewn construction guy
7532424 i dont get anybody in my office who says my husband sits on the couch all day and eats bonbons and i want to have sex with him all the time
7532425 i didnt even realize what i said until the assistant said excuse me
7532426 once i realized my blunder we ended up having a pretty good laugh about it i am very glad she had a sense of humor but it was a good lesson for me in the future
7532427 all of the sudden the meteorologist has this look on his face and so did my co anchor i looked at them both and said you know weve got lake tuscaloosa they were like ok and we went off the air
7532428 they said you just said b tches on tv i said no i didnt they played the tape back for me and sure enough it sounded like i said the cuss word fortunately we did not get any calls of complaints
7532429 a bit long in the tooth and seemed far older than her actual age of 50 something
7532430 in one highly demonstrative motion similar to that of a major league baseball umpire throwing a player out of the game grandma shrieked youre outta here
7532431 i took one test and then i took four more
7532432 the girl said its supposed to have four chambers and she thought she only saw three
7532433 i started crying and my husband was like what are you talking about
7532434 everything else was a blur i thought i can feel him moving in my stomach but hell never survive
7532435 i was thinking please let him hang on long enough for me to see him
7532436 why something happened with this child we have no idea
7532437 if i could give him my heart id do that any day
7532438 we want to make sure he is situated so he doesnt have to worry
7532439 it needs a stigma attached to it and we need to tell people what to look for
7532440 the most illicit drug dealers are selling this as well
7532441 he was emptying handfuls out for a couple of bucks
7532442 if you can control this on time you wont have as many young people addicted
7532443 it takes the courage and strength of a soldier to ask for help
7532444 whatever mechanisms theyve used over the past 40 years they arent working anymore
7532445 living that life and then coming back to the world people expect you to be the same person that left
7532446 back then it was like ill just have a beer
7532447 then he howled i never heard a sound like that
7532448 but this was beyond coping i think i hid everything i could away
7532449 they were things i thought i had forgotten but i guess not
7532450 because it haunts me and i know it will haunt them too
7532451 you certainly wouldnt say that a person who lost his leg in afghanistan or iraq was weak for receiving a prosthetic leg
7532452 whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7532453 this working class kid from scranton and wilmington has always been a friend to the underdog and all who seek a safer and more prosperous america to live their dreams and raise their families
7532454 the reality is that this is going to be barack obamas week
7532455 we dont have any illusions about the challenges we face in getting our message out but you cant expect people to cover you if you dont show up
7532456 there should be a balance and we want to make sure were available to tell the other side of the story
7532457 youll have a sense of who she is and what our values are and how were raising our kids
7532458 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket
7532459 you almost have to go to extraordinary lengths to avoid her as the vice presidential pick of the democratic party
7532460 has a high regard for senator clinton shes going to be an important voice in this campaign shes going to be an important voice in moving this country forward in the next administration he felt that senator biden would be the best fit for him at this time
7532461 hillary clintons support of barack obama is clear she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care
7532462 john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7532463 i dont have to lead you to anything its showed up over the last eight years
7532464 the city told us this is not a flood area
7532465 half the fun of breaking up is making up said mitch ceasar broward county democratic chairman
7532466 were out in the boondocks it seems like somewhere in kansas away from the action said michael lockwood a disabled 51 year old delegate from fort lauderdale
7532467 but people understand the greater cause and are united in winning the election
7532468 when you get spanked you feel it said former hillsborough democratic chairwoman lynn marvin
7532469 the only way we will be successful is if we are unified as a party and all democrats know we are full partners
7532470 its been a long journey said floridas democratic chairwoman karen thurman who blamed the republican controlled legislature for the mess and said that in hindsight she would have done nothing differently
7532471 id like to thank the 1 75 million democrats that got out and voted and showed their opinion at the voting booth this is a gift to them
7532472 this showed you can challenge a system that doesnt work well and you can land on your feet levin said
7532473 no state should have a dominant and privileged position in this process iowa shouldnt have it new hampshire shouldnt have it michigan shouldnt have it florida shouldnt have it thats the principle were fighting for
7532474 i dont think the delegates come for a view of denver
7532475 the only view that does count is the view of the podium of which we have premier seats
7532476 im almost in tears from the pain and hes milillo yelling lets ride up and down the beach looking for chippies girls
7532477 i told him i need to go home take some tylenol or something because im dying it didnt kick in right away
7532478 the funny thing is i get in there and its scorching hot
7532479 then suddenly im wondering if it got freezing or something because i cant feel anything i tried to get out and i couldnt move i cant even describe it it was the craziest feeling
7532480 i just didnt think hewasthathurt thensuddenly the kid cant feel anything
7532481 the doctors looked at me and said youre going to die i cant explain how that feels
7532482 its weird to go from surfing one minute to sitting in a hospital bed and you cant move or feel your legs
7532483 ive got 29 years in the military i know how to solve problems you dont just accept defeat
7532484 it was like somebody reached into my chest and ripped my heart out you want to yell at someone but theres no one to blame
7532485 they said i would never walk again but they didnt know why i was a medical mystery
7532486 i told them i moved my leg i moved my leg
7532487 i thought i was having a bad dream and just like that its over
7532488 no way did i ever think i was gonna be in this wheelchair my whole life
7532489 that was some christmas present for my parents wasnt it
7532490 and then you live it and you keep living it as long as you can
7532491 half of our office was wet but it was the half that didnt have the servers or voting equipment
7532492 were open for business were dried out were open and weve verified access to all our polling places
7532493 we want to make sure that polling places are sound that theyre able to be gotten to and that voters are safe when they travel to those voting places
7532494 and i want to be sure we get accurate results on tuesday night
7532495 weve been prepared for over a year weve done everything we possibly could
7532496 absolutely this election is one of those historic moments im doing everything i can to campaign for sen obama
7532497 we are doing what the obama campaign asked us to i was asked to come here and i came we have said we will do what we can and what were asked to do thats really in their hands as well
7532498 the obama campaign did not authorize and was not involved in the production or distribution of this document sen barack obama has not endorsed warren dawson in the primary for district 59 state representative
7532499 ill use whatever i need to protect the interest of my country and the military and the state of florida
7532500 we are excited to announce this slate of speakers each of whom shares john mccains love of country and commitment to serving a cause greater than ones own self interest
7532501 they told me they had a foot of water in their parking lot and couldnt get their trucks out
7532502 i think hes going to win and were going to win big
7532503 i think he has a good teammate with biden and the people are just tired of business as usual
7532504 a very viable strong vice presidential candidate who adds a lot to the ticket
7532505 id give obama 60 40 odds right now of winning
7532506 its a toss up in florida right now and weve got a lot of work to do but he is opening 50 campaign offices in the state and hes got 150 000 volunteers to hit the streets for him thats unprecedented in florida
7532507 i think right now were even but obama has a lot of people working in registering voters
7532508 the polls right now are even but i think we have a good fighting chance
7532509 i think what weve had in florida has been one disaster after another in our state budget and with the lack of leadership weve seen the only way to save our state will be to vote democratic
7532510 the fact is that our teams are working closely to ensure a successful convention and will continue to do so senator and president clinton fully support the obama biden ticket anyone saying anything else doesnt know what theyre talking about period
7532511 and her comment this is the first time im proud to be an american as an adult
7532512 maybe one day he will do something to warrant all this attention
7532513 its going to be an incredible opportunity for her to be introduced to america as a warm loving mom a supporting wife and a professional
7532514 like all of you and like women ive met all across this country i play so many different roles
7532515 but most importantly im a mom my girls are the first thing i think about when i wake up in the morning and the last thing i think about when i go to bed at night
7532516 you look at her resume and theres nothing but achievement
7532517 that was a big lesson in our house you cant let what other people think about you affect who you are
7532518 for the first time in my adult lifetime i am really proud of my country
7532519 hillary was always considered whether right or wrong a co president she had a lot of influence i see that even with michelle obama and that gives me a reason not to vote for him said democrat annette kocsis a 68 year old retiree from clearwater who participated in the
7532520 she portrays the same kind of lifestyle that i have shes a soccer mom and thats basically what i am
7532521 were a big part of this were also a very large delegation its kind of hard to miss us and its really going to be hard to miss us now
7532522 right now its wonderful to be whole to know that our state has a voice when youre spanked you feel it
7532523 we have to come together we cant have a party divided
7532524 the only way we will be successful is if we are unified as a party
7532525 and we know that after the storm the sun always comes out
7532526 we have to move on from here and get about the business of electing a democrat to the white house
7532527 they accept the principle that weve been fighting for that no state should have a dominant position
7532528 what i want us to walk away from this whole experience with is how do we make this better
7532529 as a floridian i hope that they give us our votes back
7532530 as a person who looks at the impact it is going to have on 2012 i have to wonder about it
7532531 i am honored to be named by senator barack obama a vice chair of the democratic convention
7532532 this convention will be an opportunity for barack obama to introduce himself and his vision to all americans with their election president obama and vice president biden will begin to turn the page on the tragic legacy of president bush and chart a new course for our nation
7532533 should we crack wise about the clinton national convention or should we go straight to making their candidates first name clinton clinton obama as we did when we turned walter mondale into carter mondale or we could say obamas middle initial doesnt stand for hussein it stands for hillary thats a knee slapper so many openings all good ones
7532534 in the end there was a compromise reached but a couple of delegates and an alternate got replaced
7532535 its a state the republicans absolutely need to win to get up to 270 votes a winning majority in the electoral college
7532536 if obama takes it its hard to see how mccain can make that up
7532537 if he can turn it into a race where mccain really has to work to win florida it will be to his advantage
7532538 we have sort of become a nation of whiners this is a mental recession
7532539 if you are making more than 250 000 then you are in the top 3 4 percent in the country
7532540 in a free market theres going to be good times and bad times thats how markets work
7532541 if you think this economy is working well if you think george bush has been a good steward of the economy then you should vote for john mccain
7532542 thats behind us i support this nominee without reservation as well as his choice for vice president
7532543 he is a very hard working chief of staff who knows a great deal about florida
7532544 i think weve run a much more vigorous campaign in terms of going door to door
7532545 were going to have a whole new economy based on energy
7532546 i think its time florida stepped up to the plate and accepted some responsibility
7532547 what weve done is socialized insurance and its not working
7532548 we just need to go right back to the drawing board
7532549 were hoping a good candidate and a good campaign will lead us to a victory
7532550 i dont think thats a good alternative but if they can prove that it is and they want to pay royalties to the taxpayer then we have something to talk about
7532551 im prepared to preside over legislation that will take a comprehensive approach
7532552 a lot of campaigns went to e mail and phone calls
7532553 even fixed pre scheduled air time which is very expensive isnt running that really plays havoc with your strategy
7532554 i expect it to be busy over the weekend but it wont make up for the two days we lost
7532555 im a resident like everybody else but im also a governmental person
7532556 if there is a problem i turn to the city for help
7532557 adam hollingsworth received an urgent call from a concerned resident and responded based on need
7532558 he acted outside of our policy and he has since admitted that
7532559 that cost me money for those guys to be down there because i pay their salaries
7532560 when you have that many people doing that when theres a storm going on and people really need help thats just blatant
7532561 because all of her hard work she should get a little more recognition
7532562 if water was coming into my home id ask for the same thing politician or not
7532563 our public works employees were able to help save these homes
7532564 he doesnt want to limit his ability to work with both candidates on the issues that matter to floridians like national catastrophe insurance
7532565 i think this is going to be a historic occasion this is not an ordinary cut and dry convention i expect there will be a bit of a floor fight
7532566 its going to be hard to get tickets im going to call in some favors for that one
7532567 ill get to vote for clinton on the first ballot i believe this is a healing process anyone who worked that long that hard should have the opportunity to hear their name
7532568 this presidential election is not about male or female black or white rich or poor but getting the best candidate in
7532569 i think sen clinton and president clinton will be very professional at the convention at first i thought there might be a huge protest but now my gut feeling is everything will be civil
7532570 i kind of felt our country needs to be energized ive been involved in politics for a while never to the point of going to a convention maybe i can come back from this and convince more people to do what they should be doing to change our country
7532571 its a great year to be a delegate with the all the interest with the primary if there ever is a year to be a delegate this is it
7532572 we all get floor passes but i cant vote until im a designated delegate to vote
7532573 this is a big pep rally i expect all the democrats to come together to come out unified on our way to november we just have to make sure florida gets on board as florida goes the country goes
7532574 when i listen to obama speak his designs for change his positions correspond to my beliefs on the war in iraq on health care i want to be part of this historic moment at the time i ran i looked at this as the first time were going to have an african american or female running for president
7532575 im not sure what theyll be able to do but i want them to be a part of history
7532576 youre separating a family we dont know their financial stresses we have not walked a day in their shoes i dont doubt these parents love their children they just need help
7532577 they would have taken my kids if i wasnt honest with them
7532578 when he sees me he is excited when i leave he grabs his face and cries
7532579 im angry im frustrated i dont know how anyone lives as a single mom
7532580 without this program i was ready to throw my hands up
7532581 i wasnt just another dcf case to them i was a real person with real problems
7532582 you dont just turn if off when you go home
7532583 you worry about whether you did what you needed to do to make sure the child is safe and youve helped the family
7532584 not everybody can knock on peoples doors at 2 in the morning and talk to complete strangers
7532585 and when it comes to taking a kid who is crying for their parents its just not for everybody
7532586 thats the life of a pi man protective investigator you never know i never want to go into a home thinking shelter first you want to do everything you can you feel like you are giving the child another chance
7532587 when you take a child from a bad situation and put them in a good situation and watch them recover its the greatest thing in the world
7532588 the only way we will be successful is if we are unified as a party
7532589 weve lived through hurricanes in florida and we know that after the storm the sun always comes out
7532590 we realize mistakes have been made but were excited in florida
7532591 our business is to elect the next president of the united states not to debate history
7532592 but you have to think of the safety of your child
7532593 every doctor knows you cant get sued for doing a c section but you can get sued for not doing one
7532594 c sections are only related to one factor malpractice risk
7532595 i have a large amount of high risk and complicated pregnancies
7532596 it has become more popular nationally and locally for patients to request an elective c section as their route of delivery for a variety of reasons
7532597 i get asked about it about once or twice a month
7532598 i think the professional liability pressure for obstetricians in florida is higher than any state in the nation
7532599 its frustrating to know as a speciality that weve increased c sections without any meaningful improvement in outcomes
7532600 these babies cost a lot of money to treat and there is a greater mortality risk and of having long term handicaps
7532601 research still shows c sections are more dangerous than having a vaginal birth
7532602 i dont think were finished with changes in voting equipment not when were using 4 tons of paper in this election and were tiny
7532603 the question of what to do with the ballots when youre done was expressed but with no real appreciation
7532604 it costs an exorbitant amount and then we have to keep the paper in storage for so long
7532605 when you look at the numbers its a staggering amount of paper
7532606 the jury is still out how big shale is going to be
7532607 right at the time oil prices are skyrocketing were struggling with the economy were concerned about global warming and national security threats remain intense we wake up and weve got this abundance of natural gas around us
7532608 you can have a transition with natural gas that is cheap abundant and clean
7532609 shale is the most significant domestic natural gas find in 50 years
7532610 which means the united states will become gas independent and more industrially competitive versus europe for gas intensive industries such as chemicals fertilizer smelting iron and aluminum
7532611 its hard for me to believe we will have more domestic gas production in six years than we have now
7532612 the larger reserves could very well be out there but their magnitude is uncertain
7532613 we see natural gas as potentially a very important transitional fuel but we cant use it at the expense of our natural resources
7532614 producers will slow down or at least not be as aggressive
7532615 our campaign is literally just beginning well be in a race to the finish like nothing weve seen before
7532616 were tired of fay and glad it looks like shes gone
7532617 all that water is falling into the basins to the north that river levels going to stay up
7532618 the water is very deep its already at everybodys door
7532619 it cost a whole lot of money for a very low turnout
7532620 i think weve got about 6 percent of registered voters voting which isnt high but is higher than usual for a primary
7532621 damage and loss of life that we have already seen from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm can be devastating dangerous and deadly
7532622 these funds will be critical in helping provide humanitarian relief for the millions of floridians impacted by tropical storm fay
7532623 we will put this money to work immediately to help our citizens and to stimulate the local economies
7532624 we can pay for it when we can do some good or when you have to pick up the pieces
7532625 they are now considered essential parts of the health care structure in these communities
7532626 the whole kennedy family will be in a special section it should be quite a moment
7532627 baracks whole message is i can stand in everyones shoes
7532628 is remarkably underdeveloped when it comes to talking about mixed racial experience the places in between for those people who are neither black nor white but both the opportunity with obama is maybe we can start to craft this language to break out of that calcified language america has held on to for all these years
7532629 i know a lot of hardened clinton delegates who are going to be ok theyre going to wind up supporting sen obama
7532630 but they want to cast their votes for her i think thatll make it easier for there to be closure
7532631 were watching while lawmakers party with donors in denver and the twin cities and well be watching when they go back to washington d c and party some more
7532632 this way journalists citizen activists and anybody who likes can find out about these parties and connect the dots to see how all this schmoozing may affect how lawmakers make decisions about energy health care and other public policy issues
7532633 you know theyre paying for breakfast for our delegates its something theyve been doing for years and years and years
7532634 so far the public has only seen the sound bites and the youtube version and you have not heard from michelle
7532635 it will be a proud moment to see the unedited version the smart graceful harvard educated lawyer mother and supportive spouse
7532636 the muttering you hear is that she has a little too much edge
7532637 shes too smart and too accomplished to stand out there and smile for 15 minutes the challenge is to get up there smooth and charming and not have too much attitude
7532638 it is intended to be very personal open and very revealing about who they are
7532639 america will know their values their life decisions and what drew them to one another
7532640 spouses arent viewed as being as threatening or as partisan as their husbands
7532641 because they are not running for office themselves they can do things voters of both sides of the aisle can appreciate involving illiteracy health care the environment or children
7532642 the way he spoke to me and the people there that morning i thought he was very special this is the kind of candidate we see once in our adult lifetime
7532643 i even listen to myself and say geez stacy you sound like you drank the kool aid
7532644 i felt like i had my skin stripped every time i went to talk there
7532645 he raised hundreds and hundreds of thousands for hillary in the primary
7532646 i promoted hillary because she knows us she understands us
7532647 i got not one cent from her and ill get as much from obama
7532648 will latinos cast a vote for mccain because they cant bring themselves to vote for a black man
7532649 yes some will and others may stay home and others may hold their nose and vote the democratic ticket
7532650 people are not going to stay home and the traditional gop effort to tamp down voting by the elderly by minorities and by the working class all strong democratic voters wont play
7532651 as the mayor has stated before his focus remains on serving the citizens of detroit not on presidential politics therefore he will not be attending the democratic national convention
7532652 to ensure we have the appropriate time to prepare for what we hope to be a favorable ruling that will remove the extreme requirements of a tri county travel restriction and a tether
7532653 the mayor has never been a flight risk therefore we believe these restrictions should be removed
7532654 i talked to doug baker about coming down for the hearing and he told me not to bother because it wasnt taking place on monday
7532655 its a protest against president bush and vice president dick cheney it is in support of obama
7532656 stop the torture stop the war this is what were fighting for
7532657 the war in iraq and the war in afghanistan are both the wrong wars
7532658 if the us wants to stop terrorism they should stop participating in it
7532659 john mccain and obama are both saying afghanistans the right war
7532660 you said you were going to get us out of iraq so do it
7532661 i dont even care what kind at this point just cold
7532662 we expect as this system continues to move conditions will deteriorate across the panhandle theres the possibility of very strong severe thunderstorms
7532663 well continue to stand with you in the days ahead
7532664 fema has received the governors request it is a priority and is currently under review we are doing preliminary damage assessments
7532665 were on the moist side of the system well continue to have bouts of heavy rainfall through sunday into monday and tuesday
7532666 i would be surprised if we end up with less than 8 inches in tallahassee
7532667 all this waters going to flow downstream for the st johns thats northward
7532668 this just tells us that were in for quite a siege of water in the st johns
7532669 adjustments have been made but it is along the same lines of events that weve had in the past
7532670 that is not to say that there will be no parties at the conventions
7532671 we are just following the guidelines of the ethics committee and we are completely staying within what they have deemed appropriate
7532672 i dont like the role of stepping in and being a party pooper
7532673 it is the members of congress that will have to face the consequences of any violations
7532674 i probably shouldnt go there but i will anyway the mormon religion is totally not the bible
7532675 its very hard but if hes the choice ok he is a good man
7532676 i would support the ticket if romney was the choice but i dont think hed bring what huckabee would bring
7532677 you need to get conservatives and evangelicals excited right now theyre not excited
7532678 there are some evangelicals who say hes got to choose huckabee or ill stay home
7532679 hes got a long background of being a good administrator and lord knows the country needs that
7532680 if he was a number of republicans who have problems with mccain would look beyond them
7532681 it just shows the bankruptcy of their campaign they have no relevant ideas
7532682 it was so well organized and such a great experience for me and the kids
7532683 an opportunity for senator clinton to see her delegates many for the first time since the primaries ended thank them for their hard work and support and most importantly to encourage them to support and work for senator obama as strongly as she has in order to elect him in november
7532684 i do not own my vote i have to represent the voters who sent me
7532685 the best way for george bush to help mccain is to galvanize the republican base the conservatives the evangelicals those folks with whom he has great credibility
7532686 he will call on the party to do everything it can to elect john mccain
7532687 the governor had an obligation to raise funds for the convention and the financial obligation is tremendous
7532688 this is about civic pride for the state of colorado from our unions perspective we are supporting the democratic candidate and party and it needs to have the money to run a good convention program you cant do it in a pup tent
7532689 its not some secretive soft money slush fund because its really going to a convention
7532690 they missed a tremendous opportunity to really take the initiative and make it a reality
7532691 it was like they were trying not to reach me
7532692 what would give this body the right to add five more years five more weeks or five more minutes to someones sentence handed down by a judge and jury
7532693 the key issues right now for the people in district 42 are the economy and jobs
7532694 i am pro life i am pro 2nd amendment right to bear arms if elected i will show respect to each individual and i will have an open door policy
7532695 ive been here in the district for 10 years and i think my business experience could help in tallahassee
7532696 one is the economic development issue we want to create a biomedical corridor from clermont and recruit private industry we will have we care centers and recruit those to the area it will strengthen our tax base and provide careers for people
7532697 when times get tough they need you just as much as when times are good
7532698 vsnotepad 2 allows you to organize your notes with a modern simple and complete interface
7532699 oh god not again did we pick the wrong liberal one more time
7532700 who do you want in your living room on your television sets every day for the next four years who do you trust to defend your children and grandchildrens future
7532701 a lot of people had high gpas and still didnt get accepted
7532702 we could because of quality take a lot more students if the resources would allow us
7532703 we continue to tell them what weve always told them keep your options open and apply to other universities
7532704 there are a lot of kids that have kind of accepted their fate
7532705 ufs now looking at the big picture beyond grades and curriculum
7532706 to be a really successful university you must have the elements of diversity
7532707 its easy for those of us with plentiful food supplies to ignore the issue but we have a responsibility to use science to help the less well off where we can im asking to see the evidence if it has been a disaster then please provide the evidence
7532708 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7532709 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7532710 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7532711 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7532712 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7532713 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7532714 they speak their minds so you see bullying in the form of teasing taunting social isolation and name calling
7532715 kids who are bullied are at greater risk of physical symptoms physical complaints emotional problems and academic underachievement
7532716 when you see signs of being anxious sad and withdrawn of having a kid move off their typical personality it alerts you that something is going on
7532717 when you see a real change in a childs personality or their normal routine its a bad sign
7532718 one of the reasons kids dont tell their parents they are being bullied is the fear that their parents will run in and do something about it and they think that will make it worse
7532719 you often know them your kids have been in school together you feel like calling them up so theyre on the defensive and really its never a point of resolution
7532720 you need to find out when it is happening where it is happening and exactly what is going on
7532721 younger kids have a limited arsenal from which to draw
7532722 they want to know about it because it ripples into the classrooms and places that arent visible to them
7532723 i do not want parents to leave us out of the scenario
7532724 you will encounter situations where parents will tell their kids if you are hit i want you to hit back
7532725 the best case scenario as local school principal we are bullyproof fully free of any bully incidents that we are truly here with academic focus no fighting no teasing no name calling none of that were here to learn
7532726 podran decir que soy un so ador pero no soy el unico
7532727 when you do shop at the grocery store its very limited they dont have a very wide selection
7532728 i think if we had a farmers market i think we would shop more and eat more produce
7532729 were already outpacing 2007 so i think were going to see significant growth
7532730 it helps the local farmer it helps the families both stretch their food dollars and makes sure they are getting access to fruits and vegetables
7532731 trying taking up a different craft for a little while to mix things up a bit
7532732 americans who share barack obamas vision of making america stronger and safer
7532733 life story his commitment to change and voices of americans who are calling for a new direction for this country
7532734 theres a lot of horse trading in the senate on gambling issues especially when they have the reassurance that the house is not going to pass those
7532735 a first look at the 2008 republican national convention podium
7532736 people vote for a person if they know the person if they trust the person if they believe the person is going to strive to find pragmatic solutions to problems
7532737 do not have anything in common with obamas liberal policies
7532738 the results showed a clear link between outlook and risk of breast cancer with optimists 25 percent less likely to have developed the disease conversely women who suffered two or more traumatic events had a 62 percent greater risk
7532739 young women who have been exposed to a number of negative life events should be considered an at risk group for breast cancer and should be treated accordingly
7532740 the mechanism in which the central nervous hormonal and immune systems interact and how behavior and external events modulate these three systems is not fully understood
7532741 the relationship between happiness and health should be examined in future studies and relevant preventative initiatives should be developed
7532742 when you do shop at the grocery store its very limited they dont have a very wide selection
7532743 i think if we had a farmers market i think we would shop more and eat more produce
7532744 were already outpacing 2007 so i think were going to see significant growth
7532745 it helps the local farmer it helps the families both stretch their food dollars and makes sure they are getting access to fruits and vegetables
7532746 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7532747 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7532748 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7532749 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7532750 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7532751 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7532752 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7532753 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7532754 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7532755 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7532756 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7532757 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7532758 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7532759 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7532760 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7532761 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7532762 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7532763 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7532764 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7532765 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7532766 my husband was driving the support van and it all happened very quickly and suddenly
7532767 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7532768 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7532769 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7532770 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7532771 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7532772 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7532773 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7532774 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7532775 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7532776 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7532777 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7532778 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7532779 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7532780 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7532781 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7532782 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7532783 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7532784 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7532785 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7532786 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7532787 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7532788 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7532789 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7532790 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7532791 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7532792 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7532793 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7532794 the results showed a clear link between outlook and risk of breast cancer with optimists 25 percent less likely to have developed the disease conversely women who suffered two or more traumatic events had a 62 percent greater risk
7532795 young women who have been exposed to a number of negative life events should be considered an at risk group for breast cancer and should be treated accordingly
7532796 the mechanism in which the central nervous hormonal and immune systems interact and how behavior and external events modulate these three systems is not fully understood
7532797 the relationship between happiness and health should be examined in future studies and relevant preventative initiatives should be developed
7532798 people are learning to live within the loopholes and party on
7532799 ive had to scrub some menus and say youve got to dial this back
7532800 about being relevant to the political process at a moment of maximum attention and helping showcase a good cause
7532801 they are events for our supporters to interact with our governors
7532802 we are making inroads with elected officials and policymakers so when we come to capitol hill we are not coming in cold
7532803 democrats need to raise money to compete in house elections all across the country
7532804 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7532805 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7532806 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7532807 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7532808 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7532809 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7532810 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7532811 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7532812 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7532813 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7532814 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7532815 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7532816 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7532817 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7532818 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7532819 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7532820 the lord your god is with you he is mighty to save he will take great delight in you he will quiet you with his love he will rejoice over you with singing
7532821 ok theres these two people im thinking about dating one is really nice but can be a little boring sometimes and the other one is really interesting but is all over the place which one should i go for
7532822 but i want you to be picky i want you to find a good match
7532823 my grandmother told me i should give people a fair chance
7532824 my friend tells me i expect too much of others
7532825 my moms afraid that if i dont find somebody soon i might end up with no one
7532826 boy i shouldve settled more i really shouldve lowered my standards
7532827 if i say no to this one i may not be able to find someone better
7532828 if you could go out with someone whod really be a good fit the ideal person what would that person be like describe them to me
7532829 well what if i ask them out and they say no
7532830 money is important in life it does not give you happiness we all know but it sure calms the nerves
7532831 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7532832 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7532833 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7532834 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7532835 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7532836 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7532837 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7532838 who are open to doing something on the production side
7532839 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7532840 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7532841 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7532842 para usar a intelig ncia n o necess rio mais informa es e sim medita o precisamos fazer mais sil ncio precisamos pensar menos nos entregar mais tornar se menos mente e mais cora o precisamos tomar consci ncia da magia que nos circunda da magia que a vida magia que deus magia presente no verdor das rvores e no vermelho das rosas magia presente nos olhos das pessoas a magia est em toda parte ela est dentro de voc tudo miraculoso pare um minuto e apenas observe o que est em volta tudo isso j um milagre
7532843 when thousands of peoples is riled up to see you that could arouse your ego
7532844 they gotta put your face on a 5 000 bill
7532845 we need to make it personal we need to make it our business to educate folks
7532846 theyre conscious of the relationship with the city and arrowmont and want to do everything they can to preserve that relationship
7532847 theyve offered options on how to keep the arts and crafts school on the property
7532848 obviously a development that size would cause concern until you know more about it
7532849 if i didnt live there and didnt own commercial property it would still be a concern until i knew more about it
7532850 gatlinburg probably is the best of all the cities in terms of having sufficient regulation in place that will protect the public
7532851 its the only place that has got any architectural standards and its got stringent rules like height requirements that make it well suited to handle such a project
7532852 i dont know if its going to happen or not
7532853 it sure has a lot of peoples attention right now im the type who says show me the money if theyre really going to do this then the next big thing is closing on fun mountain property and if they then cut a deal with pi beta phi then its a pretty good indication its a done deal

7532856 that decision is not going to help things it only adds to the tensions in the region
7532857 we have not changed our position namely that the sovereignty of georgia must be respected and for russia to stick to the six point plan and withdraw its forces completely to the august 7 positions
7532858 to withdraw to the lines held prior to the outbreak of hostilities
7532859 we were concentrating more on the flight than the record

7532867 marcus crandells a vet in this league and something like that makes you think about your job security

7532870 i can do anything you can do even if you are a little older
7532871 i cant help but suppose that the blame ought to rest a little more upon you than on the other two they are foolish children good solid citizens but a little young and impetuous i can only guess that you had a much greater understanding of the seriousness of the situation before you even acted even at your age you are already one of the few true masters of the divertisement whether its fair or not your actions have much greater consequences than the actions of others people will follow you for whether you know it or not you are a leader of men only take care where you lead them
7532872 i can use you greatly you might become very prominent a member of the ministerium or even of the inner council who knows if you continue to improve in your skills you might even become the next facilitator of the divertisement but at this point
7532873 im not convinced that your heart is in the divertisment or with the people of fair semblances at all everyone should be allowed once or twice to make a foolish choice or mistake but i am not quite certain that you even see this as a mistake am i correct or am i the one mistaken in my suppositions
7532874 why did the feeling i get seem so similar to the feeling i get whenever i have been to the divertisement why is it the same feeling i get whenever i drink my daily ration of somnia why is it the same feeling i get whenever i pause to think about who we are in fair semblances and what were doing here and how pointless it all is in fact
7532875 i would almost rather be in the impenetrable thicket again where at least the feeling is real and undisguised and unapologetic
7532876 i think you have made your position sufficiently clear you may leave this room but you are not in any case to leave the city until i have met with the inner council to determine what should be done about your rebellion i trust you realize the difficult position into which youve placed me i want only to do you good but i cannot sacrifice the good people of fair semblances even for you now begone
7532877 estoy muy feliz de poder jugar en este equipo y en esta liga el club ha hecho una fuerte apuesta por m y ahora me toca corresponderles s que el objetivo es la permanencia el primer paso ser hacer una buena pretemporada
7532878 somos capaces de ganar la liga y no se puede negar
7532879 sabemos que es muy dif cil conseguir la liga pero somos capaces y no se pude negar
7532880 llego de la mejor manera posible con ganas de empezar la temporada y de conseguir alg n t tulo
7532881 la competencia hace que el t cnico lo tenga m s dif cil para decidir pero a su vez m s f cil para el t cnico ser a dif cil no saber a quien poner porque el equipo no est bien pero si tiene jugadores que est n bien la competencia ayuda la competencia en todos los puestos es lo que hace que el equipo pelee por grandes cosas
7532882 llegamos y vimos un grupo motivado estuvimos viendo un par de partidos y se notaba la uni n en el campo lo que nos pone contentos porque siempre es bueno llegar a un grupo que tiene ganas de conseguir cosas te da ganas de empezar muy bien
7532883 no prefiero nada donde me quiera poner tratar de dar lo mejor de m estoy disponible para lo que quiera el entrenador estoy para sumar
7532884 cuando llegu sab a que habr a una competencia permanente porque este es un equipo lleno de buenos jugadores estoy dispuesto a pelear un puesto de igual a igual de estar lo mejor posible y cuando el t cnico me necesite dar lo mejor hay liga uefa y copa del rey esto es largo y hay que estar bien cuando nos necesite el t cnico
7532885 ojal pueda jugar la mayor cantidad de partidos posibles no lesionarme y estar siempre ah
7532886 he jugado en lan s en varias posiciones de extremo y de segunda punta por mis caracter sticas me siento c modo tanto de extremo como de media punta no voy a tener ning n problema en adaptarme a la posici n que el t cnico me indique
7532887 la verdad que el equipo est muy bien lo vimos algunos partidos como contra el milan lo vi muy bien muy superior y eso a uno le motiva le da fuerzas extras para saber que el equipo est convencido de que hay que conseguir cosas buenas y que va en busca de los objetivos
7532888 i respect his maverick and independent streak and now hes the one with the experience and judgment
7532889 if people are still making digs at the hillary clinton people because we supported her that is not going to bring us on board it makes us feel as though were outsiders and were democrats
7532890 the litmus test for being black is seen as supporting barack
7532891 cher is nolans first choice to play catwoman he wants to her to portray her like a vamp in her twilight years
7532892 the new catwoman will be the absolute opposite of michelle pfeiffer and halle berrys purring creations
7532893 supports the use of alternative therapies if they are proved efficacious
7532894 there is a big problem with people coming back from war they are able to survive physical wounds through body armor but they are blowing up their brains
7532895 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time
7532896 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
7532897 and then rattled off a bunch of made up crap about his academic record
7532898 i felt like putting a bullet between the eyes of every panda that wouldnt screw to save its species
7532899 if theres anything i learned when i portrayed cia agent jack ryan dealing with a nuclear weapon explosion in the us in the hit film sum of all fears its how to respond to international crises
7532900 when i served in the military as captain rafe mccawley in pearl harbor i learned what it really meant to serve your country in the cinema
7532901 i didnt portray matt murdock in the breakaway comic book movie daredevil without learning a thing or two about justice and corruption
7532902 it takes the courage and strength of a soldier to ask for help
7532903 i have always had a bad record with penalties losing the cup in england last year and then the champions league semi final plus my chelsea albeit with another coach lost the champions league final on spot kicks
7532904 i want to point out that i have won the italian super cup but i could only participate in it because mancini won the scudetto so he deserves a portion of this trophy for all the good work he did with this team
7532905 there is some worry that i might be a lightning rod
7532906 yo la admiro por la decisi n de retirarse y por la valent a de pasar de ser la ni a de franco a convertirse en roja roja
7532907 es un paradigma entre los grandes personajes de este pa s que siendo un mito del franquismo se convirti en un icono de la libertad con una retirada y una vida posterior muy coherentes
7532908 de juana es un terrorista y un desgraciado pero ha cumplido su condena
7532909 creo que la participaci n fue razonable como brasile o uno espera que se ganen todas las medallas de oro posible
7532910 la frustraci n que siempre tenemos es que esperamos que el f tbol tenga medalla de oro
7532911 brasil gan en algunas cosas que no ten a costumbre de ganar como maurren maggi que gan en salto y fue extremamente importante las muchachas de voleibol que ten an que ganar en atenas olimpiadas de 2004 y ganaron oro ahora y c sar cielo oro y bronce demostr que brasil puede prepararse mejor para nataci n
7532912 a n as brasil tuvo una disputa razonable de un pa s que a los pocos va ganando tradici n de participar en olimpiadas
7532913 estoy convencido que podemos hacer mucho m s si alcanzamos la madurez profesional en el tratamiento con nuestros atletas
7532914 rio de janeiro tiene posibilidades concretas am rica del sur nunca organiz una olimpiada y pienso que los juegos ol mpicos tienen que venir a am rica del sur
7532915 de juana es un terrorista y un desgraciado pero ha cumplido su condena

7532922 f rslaget r ett dr pslag mot 18 000 funktionshindrade
7532923 we will see the players once or twice a week depending on what problems they have
7532924 in general the physios work with the injured players while we look after the fit ones we need to be able to identify any problems as quickly as possible
7532925 we know the players so well know that we know when players are getting tired and fatigued
7532926 we use lots of different techniques particularly forms of massage it is not just a tickle massage youd get in a beauty salon its very deep and can be quite painful
7532927 the foreign players are a lot more receptive to it though because it is ingrained in them from the previous clubs but some of the british lads tend only to come to you if theyve got a problem
7532928 however once they start to see the benefits they are happy to come back

7532939 hace que el t cnico lo tenga m s dif cil para decidir pero a su vez m s f cil porque lo complicado de verdad llega si no sabe a qui n poner si el equipo no est bien la competencia en todos los puestos es lo que hace que el equipo pelee por grandes cosas

7532948 my goal is to use solar cells in a way thats unobtrusive to fashion while making something thats useful
7532949 mr ganleys unexpected late withdrawal came as shock because he had personally assured me that he would be there to take part in the debate i feel badly let down by mr ganley for not keeping his word
7532950 faced with such heavyweights mr ganley has chickened out and made america his priority instead of honouring his commitment to take part in the only public forum on the difficulties facing ireland in the wake of last junes defeat of the lisbon referendum
7532951 declan ganley took part in extremely robust debates during the campaign i think its fairly clear that he hasnt chickened out of any opportunity to address anybody about the lisbon treaty
7532952 my personal view is that a referendum is the appropriate response to the position we are in this is very much a personal view at this stage
7532953 if we want to retain our position as a constructive eu member state we cannot simply sit on our hands as some would have us do and keep saying that no means no
7532954 mr roche is not calling for a second referendum to be put that would not be a fair reflection the government is instead following the steps it said it would take in the wake of the referendum outcome
7532955 we now need to take a hard look at our situation within the eu
7532956 we have to recognise however that all other member states 26 sovereign democratic parliaments are likely to have ratified the treaty by the end of the year this will leave ireland in an isolated position
7532957 in the view of the other member states we will be preventing the eu from equipping itself to deal with the many political and economic challenges facing todays europe
7532958 european affairs minister dick roche raised the prospect of a second lisbon treaty referendum last night saying he believes it is the appropriate response to the countrys continuing political crisis
7532959 the catholic primate of all ireland yesterday voiced fears that some christians had voted against the treaty because the eu was becoming ever more secular in its outlook
7532960 mr roche said if we want to retain our position as a constructive eu member state we cannot simply sit on our hands as some would have us do and keep saying that no means no
7532961 some members of government may be relieved that the unpalatable truth is now being aired
7532962 a government spokesman said last night mr roche is not calling for a second referendum to be put
7532963 the differing views from senior members of church and state will this week reopen the entire lisbon debate but may not bring closer the finding of a solution that would ensure our continued full membership of the eu
7532964 ireland has been given until october to tell our partner states what we intend to do to rectify the situation
7532965 we now need to take a hard look at our situation within the eu mr roche said we have to recognise however that all other member states 26 sovereign democratic parliaments are likely to have ratified the treaty by the end of the year this will leave ireland in an isolated position
7532966 the european affairs minister privately does not see any chance of resolving the problem by trying to put elements of lisbon into irish law by passing bills in the dail if the legislative route was not adopted the first time out it could not be resorted to now he believes
7532967 because weve already had a referendum on this issue i think the people will have to be consulted
7532968 the government is involved in detailed research to isolate the specific matters that were most sensitive in the minds of voters as we went to the polls on 12 june those matters then have to be addressed
7532969 towards the end of the year well have to decide what our timetable is
7532970 we cannot exclude the possibility that at some stage and in the right circumstances it may be necessary to consult the people again
7532971 sub dural detour shuns the embrace of logic and reason
7532972 so many times we will meet some people and they will be so genuine loving caring and engaged people when we mention to them how awesome they seem they tell us they are mormon and we think well of course you are
7532973 this is how everyone will know that you are my disciples if you have love for one another
7532974 i am the way the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me
7532975 the most important issue that any human being can encounter in the universe is the question of what will you do with jesus
7532976 a group of strident religious political zealots determined to take over society with the institution of their religious political philosophy in a theocratic grab for power
7532977 when scholars and writers can look at the evangelical political movement and describe them as theocrats or worse as fascists something is badly wrong
7532978 basically they were saying those of you who care about abortion who care about homosexuality who care about the family disintegrating dont speak for us because we are too intellectual we are too sophisticated to be concerned about those kinds of things
7532979 you know you want to work with everybody but you dont want to work with those of us who care very deeply about some of the issues that are clearly biblical and some of the commandments that christ clearly gives

7533052 there is a wealth of misinformation about vaccines out there particularly in hollywood my husband and i took the time to speak to several doctors about our concerns what became clear to us was that delaying vaccines could jeopardize our babys life i have teamed up with every child by two to help parents get the facts straight on this very important issue
7533053 my main message to parents is that they should not be taking medical advice from me or any other celebrity they should look to their pediatrician the aap and other experts
7533054 you need to punish him if he bowls a bad ball if you continue to defend him he will always be on top
7533055 i am pleased with the way the two spinners bowled they went for 50 runs but lot of guys do go for that kind of scores these days these are two exceptional spinners and i am sure they well come back strongly
7533056 that is a bad way to talk about because that is factually incorrect

7533061 we carried eight last season and found out that its too hard on people so trading eminger will allow prospects in our system a chance to play with us
7533062 one of the knocks against him is that hes not a big kid but hes a very bright player and weve always said that if youre good enough youre big enough
7533063 thought it best he remain at the junior level before coming to the nhl since we prefer to overcook them a little bit rather than throwing them right into the mix
7533064 what impressed me most about bouchard was how disappointed he was to be cut last year
7533065 he really came to washington expecting to make the hockey club right out of junior we didnt think he was ready but we sure liked the attitude
7533066 coach bruce boudreau really liked him in training camp last season and was very impressed and wanted to make sure we got him signed so he got his wish

7533072 i once stayed with him in the same house in phase iv with pele moleboge he liked to crack jokes and it is a pity that today we are mourning him we talked a lot over the phone about different things even after he retired from football when he worked in orapa he always told me that he wanted to come back to gaborone to push some of his projects
7533073 when i checked him in hospital i never thought we would lose him and i was shocked when i heard about his death
7533074 when i was at chiefs the way he over lapped helped our course a lot even when he stopped playing we used to phone each other i will miss him

7533093 you can swim all day in the sea of knowledge and never get wet
7533094 brians one of those kind of guys whos so valuable to your team because he can impact it in so many places
7533095 he can play running back or fullback he can start a game for you he can come in on third down and catch a pass for you
7533096 its not easy managing your roster in this league if youve got a true blocking fullback or an undersized tailback theres not a lot else you can do with them but brian can do everything is he going to be great at any of them i dont know but i know hes going to be very very solid for us at everything
7533097 i think his value to this team is just going to keep increasing as he gets more experience and we know exactly what we want to do with him
7533098 when they drafted me they kind of told me they were going to be using me for everything including special teams
7533099 one of the reasons they took me was because they liked my versatility i think im most effective when im in a different role at different times
7533100 i had thought about coming out for the draft after my junior year
7533101 then i came back expecting to get a lot of carries and the ball in my hands and that obviously wasnt the case coach sat me down and talked to me about it he told me that was going to be my role and i accepted it
7533102 it was the best thing for the team i still got the ball in my hands a lot i carried it seven eight times a game and caught it five six times a game it wasnt as much as 30 40 times a game like it was in the past but i was ok with it looking back i think it helped me out in the long run
7533103 for us to be able to see that he could do that play fullback really increased his value with us when we were evaluating him he was going to be billed as a heisman trophy candidate going into his senior year and they basically told him they needed him to take one for the team that really impressed me hes a very unselfish guy
7533104 blocking was tough ac joint sprains here and there then you build up calcium in the joints and they start scraping together but they took all that out and now im as good as new
7533105 he came in and took every practice rep never told us about the pain he was in or the problems he was having
7533106 the holdout had given the rest of us a chance to get a lot of reps which cant do anything but help in the long run
7533107 probably one of the toughest offenses to learn in the league but i love it once you get the grasp of it its great its all about getting the ball in the playmakers hands and weve got a lot of playmakers on this team
7533108 having gone through that before i know it can change
7533109 not as bad as some of the guys that hit every play like the safeties
7533110 as we got to allentown pennsylvania people lined up and cheered
7533111 the common refrain everywhere we went was where do we get these cars
7533112 today it is clear that after georgias aggression against south ossetia that georgian south ossetian and georgian abkhazian relations cannot be returned to their former state
7533113 the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia have the right to get independence
7533114 we will look today at the appeals from the peoples of abkhazia and south ossetia to recognise the independence of these republics i think that all these decisions will be accepted
7533115 getting a ceasefire stopping hostilities and the troop withdrawal in eight days thats quite a lot already well have to see we have to take stock of the situation
7533116 i would like to go to amman to stand trial however what i fear is that i am convicted in advance
7533117 highlight that there are some terrorists who misuse islam and they take it as their spiritual ammunition
7533118 i wanted to depict the terrorists as if they were taking the prophet muhammad as a hostage i have no problem with islam but with the terrorists
7533119 i respect islam and its followers and i have nothing against it however i will not apologise we have freedom of the press and religion in denmark i cant apologise i respect islam and i did not target it
7533120 blaspheming the prophet muhammad and islam as well as sowing religious and sectarian discord
7533121 we welcome his reasonable approach but in our opinion this person has committed a crime and should be punished
7533122 weve definitely been excited about the growth and embrace of technology by both voters and candidates
7533123 its been explosive its light years from 2004 youtube didnt exist four years ago and now it is being heavily used for politics
7533124 google is attempting to expand its influence over the political process to help it achieve its commercial goals
7533125 google likes to bask in self congratulatory rhetoric claiming it has the publics interests at heart its all about accessing peoples data for targeted marketing
7533126 in this us election year what information could be more important than the candidates own words to describe their views actions and platforms
7533127 clearly they have chosen the path of arrogance unilateralism thats a serious blow to confidence building in the talks
7533128 if we could change the platform to show us as centrists it would take the wind out of the republicans and give us momentum coming out of the convention but many convention goers are activists they would not support this change

7533144 if the giants make a sincere overture its a good chance that strahan would consider coming back
7533145 there are other things he has to take into consideration the money and his contract with fox
7533146 but if the giants really want him they have a shot
7533147 would i like michael to be a new york giant this season absolutely absolutely
7533148 will he be i have no idea i dont even want to put a percentage on it but things changed very quickly saturday night and if one of the potential solutions is to reach out to michael worst case its certainly worth a phone call
7533149 i havent heard from anybody else so to say if i would or wouldnt is premature
7533150 the only thing i talked with michael about was his new challenge moving forward in his new assignment and he was very excited about that
7533151 obviously he loves the giants and obviously he is working for fox
7533152 right now he is relaxing and getting ready for his fox gig

7533156 young people online are sharing content and issues that are important to their lives
7533157 using video to engage that audience on the web where they hang out is a great strategy for brands that are willing to take risks
7533158 our fans and concertgoers are incredibly digitally savvy but theyre also incredibly socially active they want a place to bring the two together this is the perfect synthesis of music online networking and face to face fun
7533159 i want the performance to go from one to many to many to many
7533160 they thought of sending me back but ive had some acupuncture treatment during the week and its held up quite well today at practice and its settled down quite nicely i think ive got at least a 50 50 chance for trent bridge so were almost there
7533161 i think theres definitely a more set role for me since polly retired
7533162 i think ill bat number seven if i play which is a very important role in a one day batting line up
7533163 so the side will be looking for me to come in then depending on the situation and close the game off
7533164 i think if i bat at number three or if they send me up to go and pinch hit its a bit of a long shot weve got a fairly established top order so to send a guy in to go and pinch hit is not really something were looking at and as a player its much nicer to have a defined role
7533165 we had a bit of a team chat earlier and i dont think we played as well as we wanted to
7533166 definitely england were more up for it on the day than us we had a hard chat and a hard look at ourselves and were looking to bounce back in the second odi
7533167 i think if you compare the scores to the end we were far ahead on run rate when we chased but the three wickets that we lost in a row put us on the back foot
7533168 the wicket was really slow so obviously kp saw that and tried to take the pace off the ball through the middle overs and it definitely worked for them they got a run out on two wickets so they definitely put us on the back foot and we never recovered from there
7533169 i came over here during the last test match and from the sideline you can see theres a new vibe in the side they look energised and he definitely brings that to the team
7533170 i think they have a very talented side if you look at their bowling attack now especially with steve harmison back adding a new dimension to the side theyre definitely going in the right direction obviously the test will be the ashes next year
7533171 ive never ever labelled myself as a limited overs player
7533172 although obviously i got my opportunity to play international cricket through twenty20 which was a nice stepping stone for me into the one day side ive never labelled myself as a shorter version guy
7533173 its very difficult to get a spot in the squad at the moment weve got a very settled bowling attack with dale morne makhaya a spinner and jakes jacques kallis bowling well as a full seamer so its very difficult to find a spot but my aim is just to at least get into the squad and then from there you can work your way in
7533174 i think were different players i dont think i can ever play his role if i play in the side ill probably bat seven or eight in the test side and bowl like he does sort of keep it quiet on one side but i dont think ill bat number three in the test side so i dont think i can replace him
7533175 well have our chat in the next day or so
7533176 i think well try and be a bit more aggressive in the way we play but well also have to wait and see what the captain comes up with in terms of game plans
7533177 one of the reasons for it was the debris that accumulated on the fence itself
7533178 while the bush administration may claim its taking environmental impacts of the border wall into consideration building wire mesh fences across washes prone to debris laden floods is fundamentally flawed
7533179 it doesnt take an expert hydrologist to anticipate the potential for these walls to become like dams
7533180 especially in flash flood type of storms where a lot of water and debris are generated very quickly and can pile up against the fences very rapidly
7533181 we are still required to follow every environmental rule regulation and policy
7533182 he does not waive us doing what we would have to do without the waiver so it doesnt change anything in the environment
7533183 the monument had suggested that they take into consideration everything that can happen with a weather event

7533211 corbett attracts thousands of visitors from across the globe however people visit the park with varied expectations after watching films of tv channels like discovery and ngc tourists need to understand that visiting a forest is different from visiting a zoo you cannot expect to get up close with a tiger in short and swift visit to corbett your corbett safari will be successful if you learn to enjoy all shades of nature and wild saga of corbett is a simple attempt to depict a few of these shades that have fascinated countless wildlife lovers globally

7533218 the staff requirement for various hotels ranges between 1 to 3 persons per room depending on the hotel category this is regardless of the fact that technology is replacing manpower in operations since hospitality is a service oriented industry the challenge for upcoming hotels in pune especially the upper end ones is to find enough skilled professionals to maintain the level of service standards that regular international travelers are used to
7533219 hospitality industry specially the high end hotel segment derives value from the quality of service that can be provided consistently well trained staff with the right attitude thus becomes the most important resource as the vehicle that would deliver the desired quality service with the number of hotels growing by leaps and bounds and other service industries like telecom retail and bpos looking at the hospitality graduates for their recruitment finding and retaining quality staff has become a big challenge
7533220 in short term the growth in number of vacancies will outstrip the growth in trained manpower by a wide margin
7533221 the traditional indian view of the hospitality sector has undergone a huge change and graduates from our schools are in high demand in the travel hotel restaurant cruise ship sectors and even large corporate houses we have found that indian students educated at les roches and glion find excellent career opportunities in india as well as in europe asia the middle east and north america
7533222 well educated management personnel will be a pre requisite for offering the highest international standards of service by the hospitality industry in addition the new indian has a strong entrepreneurial spirit and we have seen several of our indian students embark on numerous successful ventures

7533224 in the indian context the most essential thing is to make such services affordable to a wider section of the public at a reasonable cost the next phase of expansion of mobile services was in the rural areas telecom policies should encourage service providers to push more and more into the interior of the country and develop business models for the rural service

7533251 that seems to be trend these days isnt it mate
7533252 if it was me obviously id like every game to be on all platforms so id only have to buy one perhaps that could happened in the future but right now it doesnt
7533253 i see where you misunderstood me here im not advocating one platform there could be multiple platforms with all these unique features but games in generation would work or even just be released on all of them as an example say i wanted to buy the wii for its control and price id buy that and be able to get the whole library of games on it obviously the problem would be hardware but if there was a standard much like with the dvd i think it could work out fine i dont know could happened probably wont id like it to because i own the 360 and the ps3 and i desperately want to get rid of one but there are like three exclusives on each that pull me towards keeping them
7533254 so as long as its good who really cares how many there are besides most of those good fps are on the ps3 too like cod4 and that doesnt take away from my enjoyment of it

7533305 ive never stumped before but i want to be a part of this
7533306 too often we jump to a solution before we understand the real problem
7533307 this question should be your last waking thought and again no trying to consciously problem solve
7533308 it may take a day or two for the answer to pop into your head seemingly from the blue
7533309 and bear in mind when youre talking on the phone there is a mental stimulus from the conversation itself in addition to the radiation
7533310 the combination makes it doubly hard to relax into deep sleep
7533311 i never had sleep problems until i started using wi fi so now i am careful to shut off my computer at home in the evening
7533312 what other 26 minute investment gives you a 54 productivity boost
7533313 i just didnt know how to turn the business off
7533314 i would look at my outbox and realize that i had replied to almost all of them in the middle of the night
7533315 one time i sent an e mail to a colleague that was just completely bizarre he called me the next morning to ask if i was okay
7533316 i spent a lot of time reading my sent mail at some point it dawned on me that it had to be the ambien
7533317 ive learned to always research any drug thoroughly before taking it
7533318 if you have sleep problems ambien is a miracle drug while it lasts
7533319 the old 80s or 90s attitude of im a type a personality i can get by on four to five hours of sleep is going out the window
7533320 a lot of these people actually die of a heart attack at 45 and 50 theyre no hero anymore
7533321 what they told me was not ok great well give you money or well send our employees
7533322 a lot of people and potential investors were extremely sensitive because they could all relate
7533323 the nature of our business is for people who could just drop in its largely walk ins
7533324 we deal with thousands of spas so we have a good sense of up and coming trends
7533325 ive been watching sleep health become a pillar as much as diets spas are moving toward health and wellness and moving away from the idea of pampering
7533326 i thought i cant be the only person that needs this
7533327 mostly due to the stress of business ownership and jet lag
7533328 you can turn a smart person into an idiot just by over tiring him
7533329 like people who have had too much to drink the chronically sleep deprived have no sense of their limitations
7533330 i would have hoped that a station broadcasting programs which describe jews as the offspring of apes and pigs and which advocates their annihilation would not receive the support of australias arabic community
7533331 we need to make a clear distinction between anti israel and anti semitic and between a terrorist organisation and a resistance group
7533332 got shot in the leg in the process i came in in time to get the last one thought you were gone guess we cant get rid of you that easy
7533333 thats irish whiskey son not that rotgut you were drunk on when i met you itll help the pain might make a poet out of you too
7533334 companys paying for you to heal up in the hotel theyll pay the doctor to come check up on you too
7533335 youll have your job when youre mended if you still want it after getting shot up
7533336 what we do here is the engineering and developing of the product not the field work
7533337 real sailors and navy officers oversee the work so the navy gets what it wants at the end of the day
7533338 its the model program on how to do it right
7533339 it was absolutely critical its not just hardware but the people who realize what the system can and cannot do
7533340 the requirements for the aegis system come from the pentagon
7533341 but the lockheed martin engineers have gotten smart and come up with their own upgrades the information flows both ways between the navy and industry
7533342 we test the radar and simulate things to test the whole system you have to go to a ship at sea
7533343 japan was our first international customer they bought four aegis ships and came back and bought two more systems spain was our second customer theyve now purchased their 5th system
7533344 we have a philosophy build a little test a little
7533345 if we continue to update the system and see results
7533346 we could be working out of moorestown for a long time
7533347 people are coming to the conclusion that its more important to rent goods then to own them
7533348 we invested in erento because we liked the founder and thought of it as an ebay for rentals
7533349 there is no other company in the u s or the european union with a liquid marketplace of this kind
7533350 a woman might be able to afford to buy a wedding dress that costs 2 000 but rent one worth 10 000
7533351 i see that my infant of prague has migrated back to his perch on the sill
7533352 demand for credit analysts rises on the buy side in wake of rating agency disasters
7533353 the credit crisis has impacted the market as a whole
7533354 the impact can be felt in a number of areas
7533355 a year ago you never looked at the balance sheet of your clearinghouse
7533356 the buy side has definitely looked to strengthen counterparty credit risk
7533357 no counterparty is infallible particularly with the household names that have been affected
7533358 we will continue to trade with counterparties that we think are long term viable
7533359 then everytime before lectures they have to give a demonstration on how to wear the life jackets
7533360 i truly admire parents who take on this great commitment

7533366 she was not asked for a single piece of paper she and senator obama have never had a single conversation about it how would he know if shed take it
7533367 sorry tal siach has decided to keep his shouts private
7533368 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7533369 president mwanawasas health has always been a problem even before he started his presidential mandate
7533370 we found that there are a variety of behaviors learning disabilities and emotional problems that are unique to patients with xxyy syndrome that may be better addressed with more targeted therapies
7533371 our research is important because it provides an accurate picture of what patients are experiencing that can help physicians who treat patients with the disorder
7533372 until now physicians have had to search the medical literature to patch together a treatment plan mostly based on information on klinefelter syndrome
7533373 as a result people with xxyy werent being screened for the specific medical problems associated with their disorder they werent receiving therapies or medications for the behavioral and neurodevelopmental issues that are more profound for them and they werent receiving the types of community services that can help them live independent lives our research is an important resource for families and practitioners
7533374 life skills are more of a struggle for these males and they may need different medications a broader array of behavioral therapies and more intensive community support than those with klinefelter syndrome
7533375 we were tired of having our families running around the country looking for answers from people who didnt have them
7533376 the more we talked the more we realized our boys had things in common that were not addressed in the literature
7533377 kyle knows that people dont understand xxyy and therefore dont understand him as a person she said
7533378 the study helps the world know why he is like he is it validates what he knows about himself and what we know about him when he cant follow directions its not because hes stupid
7533379 if we treat all of the lettuce and spinach then theres going to be a very rare instance of exposure to illness causing microorganisms
7533380 whats sad is that the fda after a nearly nine year review selected only two products involved with the massive illnesses in 2006
7533381 i suspect it will take awhile for the supply chain to get into place because of the limited number of irradiation facilities in place in the u s
7533382 these facilities are relatively expensive to build so you have to make sure you have adequate product flow and a market for that product
7533383 it would have to be new construction thats for sure
7533384 we wouldnt expect any immediate adoption and in fact industry wont move forward unless they are sure there wont be a backlash from consumer activists the other issue is that there is a lot more product now being labeled organic and you cannot irradiate products labeled organic
7533385 theres been a lot of research done on that and basically products that have treated with irradiation are as good or better after 14 days typical travel time than those that havent
7533386 we now know that in order to kill e coli on this type of product we can turn down the dosage level the power of the beam effectively and lettuce and spinach remain just as crisp and wholesome as if you grew it yourself
7533387 the american consumer has shown willingness to purchase irradiated products such as strawberries and meats once consumers understand the food safety implications their unfounded worries about the safety of the cold pasteurization process are eliminated even though there are a lot of naysayers and anti irradiation people giving inaccurate information
7533388 the experience with ground beef is that consumers have not reacted negatively to the label
7533389 the only negative reaction is to price it costs more
7533390 in 2006 there were an estimated 50 billion servings of green leafy salads served in this country and there were approximately 1 200 people made ill
7533391 the odds of getting a food borne illness from produce are already extremely low based upon the number of servings that we see but what we have to recognize is that irradiation is one more tool we can use to ensure the safety of our products this is especially important for at risk populations immune compromised folks pregnant women children under the age of eight and elderly these people are at high risk for food borne illness and it may be useful to feed them greens that have been irradiated for that last margin of safety
7533392 the population of the country is aging and people now live with chronic diseases longer so its important to understand from a health perspective how people are being treated as they age
7533393 there are three sides to every story yours mine and the truth
7533394 inflammation is a major factor in a number of chronic diseases affecting millions of people and can cause an unwanted impact on healthy tissue
7533395 past research has shown that the probiotic bifidobacterium infantis 35624 can positively impact the bodys immune defense3 and this most recent data suggests that its benefits are not restricted to the gastrointestinal tract
7533396 the sheer amount of diversity the students discovered surprised everybody strobel said
7533397 we have only just begun to tap the potential of these microorganisms our undergraduates have given us a peek at the treasure these habitats hold and we need to move quickly to preserve them
7533398 but at least my kids are reading instead of watching tv
7533399 but what are they reading and does it have any value
7533400 some literacy experts say that reading itself should be redefined interpreting videos or pictures they say may be as important a skill as analyzing a novel or a poem
7533401 you cant reject your bronze medal youre stripped of it
7533402 antioxidants sit within this tiny trojan horse protecting it from attack from digestive juices in the stomach
7533403 once in the small intestine the nanoparticle gets sticky and bonds to the intestinal wall it then leaks its contents directly into the intestinal cells which allows them to be absorbed directly into the blood stream
7533404 we hope that by mastering this technique drugs and supplements also vulnerable to the digestive process can be better absorbed by the human body
7533405 literally thousands of studies have confirmed that antioxidants can help prevent numerous diseases and will not anti inflammatory foods for health hundreds of ways to incorporate omega 3 rich foods into your diet to fight arthritis cancer heart disease and more healthy living cookbooks
7533406 i will be able to dance i went to the hospital ill be fine
7533407 a scripted and sanitized spectacle for a homogenous group of wealthy elites inside the convention hall versus a thriving organic movement of the masses outside
7533408 its to say to the whole country we are here
7533409 we plan to show that this is a crisis this is something that needs to be looked at with a little more urgency we dont have enough housing we dont have enough healthcare and its killing the people
7533410 democracy is not waiting to vote once every four years democracy is getting out in the streets
7533411 they the politicians are not gonna do it by themselves were gonna force their hand because that is the nature of democracy
7533412 especially now with a candidate who talks a lot about hope and change people talk about why do you need to protest
7533413 i think that we need to define what hope and change are we need to decide what that means to us as a people
7533414 for people who are disenfranchised by the system some of them for the first time are being motivated into politics
7533415 we want to create a broad progressive movement that can invite these newly politicized people in and we want to create a campaign that can take that beyond the voting booth
7533416 the story obama tells about how were gonna change this world by regular people taking action
7533417 creates more space for social movement organizing in a way we havent had since the 60s i would like to see the conventions and the protests around them take full advantage of that opportunity
7533418 use both conventions to put forward a narrative that we are starting a new chapter in american history our job is to be part of that progressive wave and to pull it to the left as much as we can
7533419 because obamas running they think weve got them theyre coming out theyre gonna support obama no matter what
7533420 some of us arent so sure that its gonna make a difference
7533421 the candidacy of obama is a reflection of the publics desire for something different
7533422 we believe that despite the rhetoric obama uses genuine change will always come from the bottom up and that means countering the system as a whole
7533423 people have learned that a top down approach to things doesnt work
7533424 what we have in common is a desire to break the spell that elections have over the us left
7533425 our message is one of direct participation in democracy bypassing corrupt politicians who dont represent us but instead further corporate interests
7533426 the rnc is a very easy target because they are so visibly to blame for whats happening in this country
7533427 theres a whole lot more energy for the rnc than the dnc
7533428 i dont know what to make of shutting down the rnc
7533429 id like to see more of a consciousness raising thing i dont want the left to be perceived as crazy
7533430 we know that it is the police not protesters or activists who will have the tasers guns rubber bullets concussion grenades chemical weapons helicopters the media spin machine and millions of dollars on their side
7533431 were just hoping that the denver police dont recreate the violence that happened in chicago in 68
7533432 recreate 68 at the 2008 dnc has become a point of contention all its own even among activists born decades after 1968 and bred amid a new world order
7533433 it provides inspiration and an example of what can be possible
7533434 but it can also prove a disservice if we just recreate 68 we will be destined to also recreate its problems
7533435 that culture of activist summit hopping im not really into that i do think it is important to show a resistance to both parties i just think that there are different ways that people go about doing that and i hope we dont lose steam over this election weve got a long way to go
7533436 is to get to work organizing where we are at our campuses workplaces and in our communities while at the same time building links with people struggling all around the world
7533437 we really need to find a way to engage the people who are excited and really do think that obamas gonna change something
7533438 we have to do a lot of popular education to say that it isnt politicians who make real change its the movements that politicians have to follow

7533441 i have been thinking for some time about creating a website where i and other songwriters could share ideas experiences and insights about this personal and often lonely endeavor in july i followed through on that goal by securing a domain www onsongwriting com and launching the blog in the process of thinking through what a useful site might look like i landed on the combination of featuring artist profiles helps introduce ourselves to each other and others who may be interested links to mp3s and urls hear what others are doing and fast track to other songwriting sites online resources and songwriting hints and tips can be helpful when youre staring at a blank sheet of paper and forget how to start
7533442 on mondays the site features my own musings on the topic of songwriting everything from the art of creativity to recording considerations to sources of inspiration each thursday i plan to feature a songwriter profile where i interview active songwriters from a variety of genres songwriters who are interested in being featured in a future profile are welcome to contact me by email

7533444 these crustaceans are sensitive to heavy metals such as copper cadmium and zinc and scientists use them as a test organisms for assessing the toxicity of marine sediments says ms chung

7533448 the increasing availability of single serve and multi packs may not serve consumers in the long run but because they are considered to be innocent pleasures may turn out to be sneaky small sins
7533449 maybe the answer lies in consumers taking responsibility for their consumption and monitoring internal cues of sufficiency rather than letting package size take control
7533450 we are the hollow men we are the stuffed men
7533451 we are a nation that shouts at a microwave oven to hurry up
7533452 if there is a real commitment to protect all children then supporting families and children before they reach the point of being abused and neglected should be a priority
7533453 we already know many of the risk factors for child abuse and neglect and in many cases we could identify many children who are most vulnerable before theyre even born
7533454 the current approach does little to prevent abuse but focuses on intervening once much of the harm has already been done an approach that in my view is both unethical and inhumane
7533455 while urgent action is needed to protect children being abused and neglected we need to broaden adult focussed services such as alcohol and drug treatment mental health corrections homelessness family violence etc so that they can enhance the parenting of their clients
7533456 we also need to use health promotion campaigns with messages such as alcohol and children dont mix given that one in eight australian children now lives in a household with at least one adult who is regularly binge drinking
7533457 child abuse and neglect needs to be attacked in the same comprehensive way we have tackled other serious health issues such as smoking or coronary heart disease that is to identify the risk factors promote a range of interventions and change community attitudes
7533458 fundamental breakthroughs in these directions are expected on a time scale of 10 to 20 years and are recognized by the international science community as major milestones on the road to a renewable fuel
7533459 breast cancer psychological distress and life events among young women
7533460 the results showed a clear link between outlook and risk of breast cancer with optimists 25 percent less likely to have developed the disease conversely women who suffered two or more traumatic events had a 62 percent greater risk
7533461 young women who have been exposed to a number of negative life events should be considered an at risk group for breast cancer and should be treated accordingly
7533462 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one severe and or mild to moderate life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women on the other hand a general feeling of happiness and optimism can play a protective role
7533463 the mechanism in which the central nervous hormonal and immune systems interact and how behaviour and external events modulate these three systems is not fully understood
7533464 the relationship between happiness and health should be examined in future studies and relevant preventative initiatives should be developed
7533465 the middle place is about calling home instinctively even when all the paperwork a marriage license a notarized deed two birth certificates and seven years of tax returns clearly indicates youre an adult but all the same there you are clutching the phone and thanking god that youre still somebodys daughter

7533482 saya tidak percaya dengan negara islam bahkan tidak percaya dengan bangsa utsmaniyah kita masing masing harus meyakini apa yang menjadi pendapat kita adapun pemerintah di ankara harus mengikuti garis politik yang tetap terencana dan didasarkan pada fakta fakta dengan satu tujuan saja yaitu memelihara eksistensi dan kemerdekaan negeri turki dalam suatu wilayah yang terbatas tidak boleh ada lagi perasaan atau emosi yang mempengaruhi politik kita buanglah mimpi mimpi dan khayalan khayalan itu sungguh kita telah membayar mahal untuk masa lalu kita

7533548 burden the original decision of the woman and the physician
7533549 would essentially bar abortions because the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child and if this is a child then this would be an anti abortion statute
7533550 as i understand it this puts the burden on the attending physician who has determined since they were performing this procedure that in fact this is a nonviable fetus that if that fetus or child however way you want to describe it is now outside the mothers womb and the doctor continues to think that its nonviable but theres lets say movement or some indication that in fact theyre not just coming out limp and dead that in fact they would then have to call a second physician to monitor and check off and make sure that this is not a live child that could be saved
7533551 if this is a child then this would be an antiabortion statute
7533552 obama is a father of two young girls you can bet that attacks like that will get him or any father riled up that language seems to be way over the top his critics can paint him as a pro choice liberal thats fair but to go any further is really beyond the pale is obama really sinister a monster

7533564 psychologists and neuroscientists have recently become fascinated by the human predilection for storytelling why does our brain seem to be wired to enjoy stories and how do the emotional and cognitive effects of a narrative influence our beliefs and real world decisions the answers to these questions seem to be rooted in our history as a social animal we tell stories about other people and for other people stories help us to keep tabs on what is happening in our communities the safe imaginary world of a story may be a kind of training ground where we can practice interacting with others and learn the customs and rules of society and stories have a unique power to persuade and motivate because they appeal to our emotions and capacity for empathy

7533580 earlier the casualty ward received between 100 to 150 patients only today the number has increased to 800 the challenge is greater but resources insufficient
7533581 i had always been passionate about giving something back to my society which is why i chose to do medicine when i joined as a medical officer in 1989 and witnessed the poor condition of state run hospitals i decided to work towards a change i wanted to uplift the ward i was given charge of and prove that the government sector can also deliver if provided with the funds and opportunity this i was able to do over the years
7533582 the emergency ward at the jpmc karachi is possibly the only ward in the country where doctors are constantly busy if there is no political clash or bomb blast we are dealing with deaths from epidemics rain and what not

7533642 the staff requirement for various hotels ranges between 1 to 3 persons per room depending on the hotel category this is regardless of the fact that technology is replacing manpower in operations since hospitality is a service oriented industry the challenge for upcoming hotels in pune especially the upper end ones is to find enough skilled professionals to maintain the level of service standards that regular international travelers are used to

7533749 in 1994 i addressed a group of prominent evangelical leaders in london having been given the subject the biblical features of revival i looked at my notes to see how lakeland measured up not even close a great awakening would among several other things i do not have the space to go into here demonstrate the centrality of biblical preaching preaching itself in lakeland has been minimal and what preaching there has been calls more attention to angels miracles and manifestations than to jesus who died on the cross im sorry but my heart is sick that these meetings have excited so many good people they are indeed good people very sincere many of them have been a part of previous moves of the spirit and since church history has taught us that those who were in the middle of a move of the spirit often lead the way in opposing the next work of the spirit some did not want to be seen doing this i can understand that when one is reported to have been to the third heaven as the main evangelist of lakeland has stated and told not to preach jesus because everybody knows about him but rather angels which people know little about i can only call this another gospel as in galatians 1 i would go to the stake for the gospel of salvation which paul preached that emphasizes reliance solely in the precious blood of christ i would certainly not go to the stake for the lakeland message and would be afraid to face god if i did it comes to this is the bible true because i believe the bible i can testify the jury of my mind on lakeland is in leave lakeland alone

7533859 it is strange how a man who immensely benefited from a process suddenly kicks against that same process democratic primaries and elections made tinubu what he is today but he seems to have forgotten that fact now he wants to play god it shows that he is not ready to practise democracy internal or external because reading between the lines what tinubu has said is that votes elections and democracy will not count in the coming council elections tinubus pronouncement meant that ac had benefited from the regime of sole administrators hence the desire to foist them once more on lagos at the flimsiest excuse
7533860 we had long ago read such tendencies and it informed why we refused to be legalistic in the matter of the local government elections and agreed to bend over backwards and to contest whether ac wants to hold election in 20 or 57 local government structures
7533861 we have all seen devastating pictures of abuse starvation homeless effects of war but never have been unified with music in a way until now that reaches the listeners core level creating feelings that pictures alone cant and that allows for the proper contribution
7533862 to unite people across the globe with music to take action to create a better world so future generations will have a planet worth inheriting

7533864 in saner climes these series of misadventures are more than enough for any self respecting person to step aside from any important post whether public or private that impacts on the lives of many
7533865 and if such a person fails to follow the path of honour by quitting then he or she should be given the boot the experience of dr co traveller on the train of indiscretion mr festus odimegwu who was cleverly eased out of his post at the nigerian breweries after getting himself bogged down in a political quagmire is still too fresh to forget

7533872 if the giants make a sincere overture its a good chance that strahan would consider coming back
7533873 there are other things he has to take into consideration the money and his contract with fox
7533874 but if the giants really want him they have a shot
7533875 would i like michael to be a new york giant this season absolutely absolutely
7533876 will he be i have no idea i dont even want to put a percentage on it but things changed very quickly saturday night and if one of the potential solutions is to reach out to michael worst case its certainly worth a phone call
7533877 i havent heard from anybody else so to say if i would or wouldnt is premature
7533878 the only thing i talked with michael about was his new challenge moving forward in his new assignment and he was very excited about that
7533879 obviously he loves the giants and obviously he is working for fox
7533880 right now he is relaxing and getting ready for his fox gig

7533912 a long term threat and a short term threat to our national security
7533913 for sen bidens iraq hearings to be anything more than a political sham used to invoke a modern day gulf of tonkin resolution equivalent for iraq his committee will need to ask hard questions and demand hard facts concerning the real nature of the weapons threat posed by iraq
7533914 everyone in the world thought he had them the weapons inspectors said he had them
7533915 preordained a conclusion that seeks to remove saddam hussein from power regardless of the facts and using these hearings to provide political cover for a massive military attack on iraq
7533916 as long as saddams at the helm there is no reasonable prospect you or any other inspector is ever going to be able to guarantee that we have rooted out root and branch the entirety of saddams program relative to weapons of mass destruction
7533917 the only way were going to get rid of saddam hussein is were going to end up having to start it alone
7533918 its going to require guys like you in uniform to be back on foot in the desert taking saddam down
7533919 one thing is clear these weapons must be dislodged from saddam or saddam must be dislodged from power
7533920 if we wait for the danger from saddam to become clear it could be too late
7533921 he did not snub the u n or our allies he did not dismiss a new inspection regime he did not ignore the congress at each pivotal moment he has chosen a course of moderation and deliberation
7533922 i do not believe this is a rush to war i believe it is a march to peace and security i believe that failure to overwhelmingly support this resolution is likely to enhance the prospects that war will occur
7533923 we must be clear with the american people that we are committing to iraq for the long haul not just the day after but the decade after

7533925 its not the intent of the charitable check off donations to have a hidden diversion of employee dollars to president strogers pet charities
7533926 the notion is employees get to direct where their hard earned dollars go todd stroger should make donations to his charity and let the employees make donations to the charity they want rather than forcing them to make donations where they might not want their hard earned money to go

7533939 the results showed a clear link between outlook and risk of breast cancer with optimists 25 percent less likely to have developed the disease conversely women who suffered two or more traumatic events had a 62 percent greater risk
7533940 young women who have been exposed to a number of negative life events should be considered an at risk group for breast cancer and should be treated accordingly
7533941 the mechanism in which the central nervous hormonal and immune systems interact and how behavior and external events modulate these three systems is not fully understood

7533961 we are ready to join a discussion but land should be returned first
7533962 if he really wants a solution he should return 400 acres and enable the tata plant to come up on 600 acre without making it an ego issue

7534037 to me if it helps anyone else out there who is in their middle aged years putting off something they couldnt do because they thought they were too old or maybe because they had a child they thought they couldnt balance things as a parent if it shows anyone you can do it im absolutely thrilled

7534041 canberra has the highest percentage of public servants than anywhere in australia and they retire a decade earlier than the rest of australia

7534047 mate no one in world rugby is playing the way their coach is talking about not successfully anyway everyone has discipline policies and a procedure in their game the way he is talking is nonsense you cant just play an expansive wide game
7534048 if de villiers keeps on going down this track he will be unsuccessful he has got to learn if he wants to coach at international level you have to have some sort of discipline involved then get the players to play for that the hard thing for peter is that he has never coached professionally an d this is one of the most difficult teams to coach
7534049 what they do demand is that you must be fitter and play better from un structured ball
7534050 but you dont need to go to a harum scarum type of game
7534051 but south africa have gone to the other extreme theyre attacking off everything and theyre going lateral not through defences you have to go through sides like australia and new zealand first south africas problem is if you have played one game then try to go to the other extreme thats a danger knowing the south african players i would say they would prefer much more discipline theres no structure in their game at present and they have lost all their discipline
7534052 they could turn it around even in 7 days 20it will be tough but they are a resilient bunch of players some of the toughest footballers i have ever been involved with
7534053 but he has to change his philosophy because it doesn t fit these players its not credible you have got to give players a framework to work under peters big test now is to learn if he learns he can turn it around but if he continues to be stubborn he wont last long because his tactics wont work
7534054 we were arrested and taken to a university for questioning we were held for nearly 24 hours without any sleep and having interrogation of up to about eight hours then we were moved to a detention centre and before we were allowed any sleep we had another 12 hours of interrogation
7534055 the guys i was with were given the reason that it was illegal to undertake even a peaceful protest and to talk about the situation in tibet

7534063 there are four people who live there and theyve got two or three of kids
7534064 yesterday afternoon i saw the man next door doing target practice against some kind of shooting board in his back garden with an air rifle
7534065 i asked him if he was with a club and he said he was i have to admit i wasnt very happy at this going on next door to me because it made a loud clacking noise and i dont like having guns so nearby
7534066 they are a nice family and are no trouble to anyone at all the little boy who was shot was a lovely boy
7534067 the family are very upset but it was a complete accident they dont want to talk to anyone
7534068 we were called to an address in washwood heath in birmingham at around 6 40pm last night following reports of a child having been shot he had suffered a serious head injury

7534096 we asked many of our customers if they would switch to recycled paper if we could get it for them at a cheaper rate
7534097 it works for every one because its the environmental choice and also offers savings to departments

7534099 theyve really improved it weve been using it in our office printers and copiers for several years with no problems
7534100 this is the book in which there is no doubt a guidance for those who have taqwa who believe in the unseen and who establish salah and spend out of what we have provided for them
7534101 the believers men and women are protecting friends of one another they enjoin good and forbid evil and they establish salah and give zakah and obey allah and his messenger allah will have his mercy on them and surely allah is all mighty all wise
7534102 so whatever you have been given is but a passing enjoyment for this worldly life but that which is with allah is better and more lasting for those who believe and put their trust in their lord and those who avoid the great sins and lewdness and when they are angry they forgive and those who answer the call of their lord and perform the salah and who conduct their affairs by mutual consultation and who spend of what we have bestowed on them
7534103 truly those who believe and do righteous deeds and perform salah and give zakah they will have their reward with their lord on them shall be no fear nor shall they grieve
7534104 when have finished performing the salah remember allah standing sitting and reclining but when you are free from danger perform the salah surely salah is enjoined on the believers at fixed times
7534105 and establish salah and give zakah and bow down in worship along with those who bow down in worship
7534106 guard strictly the salah especially the middle salah and stand before allah with obedience
7534107 seek help through patience and salah truly it is extremely difficult except for the humble true believers
7534108 oh you who believe seek help through patience and salah truly allah is with those who are patient
7534109 oh you who believe when the call is made for the salah on friday come to the remembrance of allah and leave off business that is better for you if you only knew and when the salah has ended you may disperse through the land and seek the bounty of allah and remember allah much so that you may be successful
7534110 shaytaan desires only to excite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants and gambling and hinder you from the remembrance of allah and from salah so will you then not abstain from these evils
7534111 recite that which has been revealed to you of the book and perform salah verily salah prevents from lewdness and evils and indeed the remembrance of allah by you is greatest and allah knows what you do
7534112 indeed your protecting friend wali is none other than allah his messenger and the believers who establish salah and give zakat and bow down in prayer 5 55
7534113 and stay in your houses and do not display yourselves like that of the times of ignorance and perform salah and give zakah and obey allah and his messenger allah wishes only to remove uncleanness from you oh people of the house and to purify you with a thorough purification
7534114 verily the hypocrites seek to deceive allah but it is he who deceives them when they stand up for salah they stand with laziness only to be seen by men and they do not remember allah but a little
7534115 and nothing prevents their sadaqa from being accepted from them except that they disbelieve in allah and in his messenger and that they do not come to salah except in a lazy manner and that they do not give sadaqa except unwillingly
7534116 and remain always turning to him only and be fearful and dutiful towards him and perform salah and be not of those who commit shirk

7534138 nur wenige der befragten unternehmen geben an ber ein zentralisiertes oder zentral geleitetes vertragsmanagement zu verf gen
7534139 hinzu kommt dass viele keine standardprozesse im vertragsmanagement implementiert haben sie arbeiten mit hauseigenen systemen aus tabellen und datenbanken die weder die n tige skalierbarkeit aufweisen noch die entsprechenden zugriffsm glichkeiten erlauben und keinerlei transparenz bieten dies sind aber faktoren die f r eine abteilungs und funktions bergreifende zusammenarbeit unerl sslich sind
7534140 interessanterweise stimmen die herausforderungen mit den funktionalit ten berein die sich die befragten von einer contract management l sung erhoffen das zeigt das gro e potenzial f r unternehmen prozesse durch die automatisierung ihres vertragsmanagements effizienter zu gestalten
7534141 eine umfassende l sung zum vertragsmanagement kann einen systematischen prozess f r die erstellung durchf hrung archivierung compliance und analyse von vertr gen in einem unternehmen erm glichen dies hilft bei der optimierung der betrieblichen performance der kostenreduzierung und der minimierung von risiken

7534374 the christian community in india abhors violence condemns all acts of terrorism and opposes groups of people taking the law into their own hands we have had major differences with mr saraswati the deceased vhp leader it was the hate campaigns of the sangh parivar which led to untold misery for christians including the unprecedented violence last christmas in orissa but we wish peace to everyone and urge everyone to follow the rule of law
7534375 we are concerned at reports of communal violence in the last few hours against innocent christians in nearby districts weve heard that at least one prayer hall in sudergarh was burnt the van of some catholic nuns was destroyed and the sisters were injured we urgently appeal to officials to take whatever steps are required to maintain peace and harmony in all areas of orissa to prevent further attacks on christians and to arrest those responsible for the deaths of saraswati and his associates
7534376 the situation in the district was slowly returning to normal people were engaged in rebuilding houses and settling down after a horrifying experience over christmas 2007 now we are afraid that the death of saraswati will further destabilize the situation in the communally sensitive kandhamal district the aicc will continue to work for peace in orissa one of the most undeveloped states in the country

7534401 el hablar actual sobre dios tiende a alejarse del compromiso con los dogmas o ritos de las religiones establecidas la invocaci n a dios es quiz ansia de una fuerza que d sentido a la propia vida claro que la aproximaci n a lo divino sigue estando mediada por las grandes religiones monote stas y por el creciente evangelismo y otros cultos como hare krishna budismo yoga o cultos populares como el del gauchito gil pero ahora las v as tradicionales y colectivas de la religi n conviven con la aparici n de un sujeto que puede ser receptivo a varias creencias religiosas pero sin perder por esto su independencia su no pertenencia formal a ning n culto en particular
7534402 si los profetas abraham isaac jacob ismael jos o jesucristo la paz est con l estuvieran hoy entre nosotros c mo juzgar an tales conductas
7534403 me han dicho que su excelencia sigue las ense anzas de jes s la paz est con l y que cree en la promesa divina de un reinado de los justos en la tierra

7534405 el liberalismo y la democracia de corte occidental no han podido contribuir a la realizaci n de los ideales de la humanidad

7534408 la religi n surge de la necesidad de dar sentido a la realidad de escapar al caos que significa el sinsentido el hombre desde un principio no dej de experimentar una fractura que hab a despedazado su integridad algo andaba mal se necesitaba una recomposici n para que el caos no terminara de arrojarlo al sinsentido surge entonces una actividad esencialmente simb lica destinada a otorgar sentido al grupo etnia tribu o pueblo y en consecuencia al individuo es la religi n
7534409 dios no est muerto ni agonizante al contrario de lo que pensaba nietzsche porque no es mortal las ficciones no mueren las ilusiones tampoco un cuento para ni os no se puede refutar ni el hipogrifo ni el centauro est n sometidos a la ley de los mam feros un pavo real un caballo s un animal del bestiario mitol gico no ahora bien dios proviene del bestiario mitol gico como miles de otras criaturas que aparecen en los diccionarios en innumerables entradas entre d meter y discordia as pues dios durar tanto como las razones que lo hacen existir sus negadores tambi n parece un inmortal
7534410 la religi n dijo sus ltimas palabras inteligibles nobles o inspiradoras hace mucho tiempo a partir de ese momento se convirti en un humanismo admirable pero nebuloso igual que le pas por ejemplo a dietrich bonhoeffer un valiente pastor luterano ahorcado por los nazis por negarse a actuar en connivencia con ellos no habr m s profetas ni sabios de antiguo cu o lo cual es la raz n por la que las devociones de hoy en d a son nicamente ecos de repeticiones del ayer a veces elaboradas hasta el hilarante extremo de conjurar una terrible vacuidad
7534411 ya fuera para responder al desaf o de la ciencia moderna ya para sentar las bases desde las cuales predicar el cristianismo a mundos y culturas remotas lo cierto es que la iglesia fue desarrollando de modo progresivo toda una doctrina de los preambula fidei en relaci n cada vez m s estrecha con una metaf sica de tipo objetivista
7534412 coincido con hume y con kant en que el concepto de prueba emp rica es irrelevante a la hora de hablar de dios pero este punto sirve por igual contra el ate smo y el te smo el presidente bush ha aportado un buen argumento cuando dijo en un discurso destinado a complacer a los fundamentalistas cristianos que el ate smo es una fe pues no puede confirmarse ni refutarse mediante argumentos o pruebas pero lo mismo puede aplicarse desde luego al te smo ni los que afirman ni los que niegan la existencia de dios pueden reclamar de forma plausible tener pruebas de su parte ser religioso en el occidente moderno no tiene mucho que ver con la explicaci n de fen menos espec ficamente observables
7534413 el renacimiento de la religi n en el tercer milenio no viene motivado tanto por las amenazas globales el terrorismo o la cat strofe ecol gica planetaria como por la muerte de dios por la secularizaci n de lo sagrado que ha estado en el centro del proceso a trav s del cual se ha desarrollado la civilizaci n del mundo occidental
7534414 hay nuevos relatos que ponen en juego soluciones imaginarias creencias m gicas cosas que son semejantes a los mitos simples supersticiones relatos vinculados a mentalidades primitivas que aparecen junto a la religi n tradicional

7534448 it makes the enforcement of already ratified sanctions against tehran more challenging difficult and harder to implement and moreover significantly reduces the chances of consensus among the veto wielding u n security council powers for the imposition of a fourth round of punitive measures against our nation
7534449 even though one hopes the western russian friction proves advantageous for iran it is important to emphasise that snapshot perception of events is often incomplete and at times downright false
7534450 jeopardised the u s strategic objective of exerting pressure on iran

7534463 it is the dedication of board officials such as those at the butler county board of elections who went above and beyond the call of duty that gives me confidence that preparation with our local partners will lead to a successful november election
7534464 now that what appears to be the root cause for this voting tabulation error has been identified we will prepare ohios counties using the premier voting system software with instructions for following strict protocols needed to identify and correct this error if it occurs
7534465 we will continue to monitor the situation and provide boards of elections with the instruction and support they need to ensure an orderly and efficient election and an accurate count of ohioans votes

7534467 the insect repellent deet is effective against a variety of medically important pests but its mode of action still draws considerable debate
7534468 the widely accepted hypothesis that deet interferes with the detection of lactic acid has been challenged by demonstrated deet induced repellency in the absence of lactic acid the most recent hypothesis suggests that deet masks or jams the olfactory system by attenuating electrophysiological responses to 1 octen 3 ol orn octenol

7534470 you dont ever know when youre going to see the beginning of the end
7534471 i just think that wimbledon final meant so much not only to nadal winning it but to federer losing it
7534472 i think him losing that match he has not gotten over it this is a chance for him to do that it has been all the difference in how they played this summer because of that you have to put nadal as a pretty clear cut favorite
7534473 clear favorite i dont know about that but nadal seems like the favorite even though ive won here the last four times

7534475 in the past we essentially measured quality score once per day
7534476 on a scale of one to 10 it was an eight it touched down and went back up and then touched down again tearing everything up and kicking up dust
7534477 i had the flu when i arrived i had pretty hard fevers pretty much every day and low energy i also had quite a big problem with a spasm in my neck which kind of nearly did lead to me not racing this weekend
7534478 fortunately ive got a great doctor who was with me the whole way through it it was so bad that i was struggling to basically stand up and so i had to have injections in my neck and take plenty of painkillers
7534479 i think the key point of this weekend was qualifying managing to put my car in third position it turned out that we had even more fuel than the top two cars so it was quite a good achievement
7534480 but we have to be realistic and i think the true pace of our car is more similar to the race than in qualifying
7534481 we struggled a bit more than ferrari and mclaren on the long stints as soon as the tires get a bit used then the car starts sliding too much and you cannot do anything
7534482 after qualifying i knew that my weekend was going to be difficult at the start i was touched by nakajima and i lost my rear wing my mechanics did everything to try and allow me to continue but my race was already compromised
7534483 i am extremely disappointed because i was hoping to have a special race in my second home grand prix and for the supporters who came here this weekend to support me

7534499 youre never going to have every venue filled up especially in the preliminary rounds
7534500 ticketing continues to be a big challenge for the olympic games for every organizing committee in beijing it didnt seem the problem was selling the tickets but getting people into the seats
7534501 that said beijing is so big they could have been partying in 10 different places and you wouldnt know
7534502 well be working very hard to create the right atmosphere downtown so every single night that youre in the city youll feel that youre in the magic
7534503 its embraced in our culture its part of our way of life in canada and we think its unlikely that people would not show up the goal of the organizing committee is to earn the respect of the public

7534518 having worked with many web design houses in the past it was quite an eye opening experience working with dynamix factory
7534519 ive been waiting to e mail you back since this morning i wanted to have a bit of time to let you know how much i appreciate and love the work on the entire site and of course the portfolio awesome the web searches to be listed that high is over the top you did a great job and i appreciate the fact that you never stopped caring and produced the site with the same intensions as when you first took the job
7534520 dynamix factory recently completed a website revision and redesign for us they consistently took our ideas and made them better quality value and reliability are three words to describe our experience with dynamix factory the website exceeded our expectations because of their knowledge and creativity i would recommend dynamix factory to others without any hesitation
7534521 when i ordered the seo starter package from dynamix i was not sure it would make any difference to us since we already had a highly ranking travel portal and felt we had done a decent job optimizing it ourselves but recently more competitors have come on the scene and i was getting that nagging feeling that professional seo consultation could reveal some blind spots on our site to help us keep our competitive edge scott of dynamix handled our case and after a phone discussion about our web site our report was delivered later that same day i was amazed at the thorough job and also stunned by some of their revelations the report uncovered a few serious issues that could be negatively affecting our web sites ranking that i had not even suspected these included issues i already know can be a problem but didnt realize they were happening to us the highly detailed report ends with a summary of recommended actions for anyone who is serious about marketing a web site or doing business online dynamix delivers tremendous value for the price and i highly recommend their service
7534522 dynamix has done an incredible job of analyzing the competitive landscape of our industry and formulating a plan for seo optimization i was extremely impressed by level of detail provided in their competitor analysis report as well as the subsequent site recommendations made by abhinav he went well over the required hours on our project to ensure that the report was thorough useful and provided a clear road map for achieving the search rankings we desired
7534523 i wanted to take a moment to write and let you know just how pleased and happy i am with the work dynamix search engine placement has done for us here at staged homes com and our other web sites this year

7534526 have had to innovate and take matters into their own hands and they have done an extraordinary job yet they should not have to do it alone
7534527 on the internet its a much different sensibility they want it a little more raw less filtered less varnished and i think that plays to my strengths its sort of more of a today show sensibility in terms of being relaxed or being able to make a mistake or laugh at yourself or ask an off the wall question i always thought that hopefully i could be a successful bridge between traditional media and the internet just in terms of the way i communicate in a more casual way

7534532 we had preferred a private buyer but in the present serious situation the chosen solution was necessary
7534533 they speak their minds so you see bullying in the form of teasing taunting social isolation and name calling
7534534 kids who are bullied are at greater risk of physical symptoms physical complaints emotional problems and academic underachievement
7534535 when you see signs of being anxious sad and withdrawn of having a kid move off their typical personality it alerts you that something is going on
7534536 when you see a real change in a childs personality or their normal routine its a bad sign
7534537 one of the reasons kids dont tell their parents they are being bullied is the fear that their parents will run in and do something about it and they think that will make it worse
7534538 you often know them your kids have been in school together you feel like calling them up so theyre on the defensive and really its never a point of resolution
7534539 you need to find out when it is happening where it is happening and exactly what is going on
7534540 younger kids have a limited arsenal from which to draw
7534541 they want to know about it because it ripples into the classrooms and places that arent visible to them
7534542 i do not want parents to leave us out of the scenario
7534543 you will encounter situations where parents will tell their kids if you are hit i want you to hit back
7534544 the best case scenario as local school principal we are bullyproof fully free of any bully incidents that we are truly here with academic focus no fighting no teasing no name calling none of that were here to learn

7534556 there are fewer studios and fewer movies being made people are reluctant to make movies geared toward women when i made the princess diaries in 2001 that was a breakthrough movie what worries me now is that were not providing opportunities for filmmakers with different voices and different backgrounds to be heard

7534583 we have developed an extremely simple iphone application that allows us to display comics that have been specifically formatted for the iphone ipod touch
7534584 what were doing is creating new comics and adapting existing comics into a format that makes reading comic books an enjoyable and easy experience on these devices
7534585 creators and studios will be able to set the final prices on their titles but were expecting most standard length titles to be around 99 and were encouraging creators to give away the first issues of their titles to allow new readers who may not be familiar with comics but are iphone ipod touch owners to give comics on the devices a try
7534586 with digital comics on the iphone ipod touch we have access to a world wide audience no printing costs or print run minimums and it doesnt take 3 months to get the title from in the catalog to on sale in a store each title will be featured as its own application in the app store and will be backed up onto the readers desktop or notebook computer each time they sync their device

7534594 an official order has been issued to freeze all bank accounts and assets of and their organisations
7534595 it could be a pretext for a crackdown on innocent people

7534598 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is sic going to solve the sectarian violence there
7534599 overall violence is down at least 80 percent since the surge began and ethno sectarian violence the kind that seemed to be sucking iraq into all out civil war in 2006 is down by over 90 percent
7534600 by and large whats left of the insurgency is just trying to hang on
7534601 as we have surged into neighborhoods to protect the iraqi people earning their trust and benefiting from their help violence has dropped and locals have turned against the jihadists
7534602 the iraqi people are going about their business and business is thriving it is so more and more i see it in places i could not go even six months ago
7534603 the simple fact is that sending in over 20 000 additional troops isnt the answer in fact its a tragic mistake
7534604 it wont end the violence it wont provide security it wont turn back the clock and avoid the civil war that is already underway it wont deter terrorists who have a completely different agenda it wont rein in the militias
7534605 the group will focus on education religion and social justice

7534607 one of the greatest vice presidents in the history of the united states

7534609 are the conventions scripted are they planned of course but this year theyre also exciting and historic
7534610 this is the first time since 1952 that we havent had an incumbent president or vice president on either side what we have is two candidates who bring an enormous amount of excitement to their candidacies so maybe were old fashioned but we are going to be there and on the air more than we were in 2004
7534611 they didnt suddenly get religion during the last four years what they got are ratings and profits
7534612 the networks made money off the primary campaigns in 2008 for the first time in many many elections and they want to try to continue to cash in
7534613 our job is to cover the news and there is without a question less and less news at the conventions
7534614 it is an enormous expenditure of money to cover these conventions the way we cover them and i would rather that we consider whether we should take the money that is shorter and shorter in all media and use it to cover the campaign
7534615 first i think we were all surprised by the amount of interest in the debates during the primary season which exceeded our estimates and i think were all going on the assumption that there is still a good deal of interest in politics this year
7534616 we suspected this would be an unbelievable political year but i dont think any us had any sense how intense the interest would be to the degree that several million people would come to watch our big events whether primary coverage or the debates
7534617 we know our core audience is a politically minded audience that wants this story and loves this story
7534618 we have all our resources and collective brainpower focused on this story it begins our signature time for the network to own this political story
7534619 the question i keep getting asked by people who are writing stories about convention coverage is why are you bothering whats the big deal arent they old fashioned havent they outlived their purpose
7534620 and i am always coming back saying this is the end of the most exciting campaign in my lifetime why wouldnt you want to be there for it

7534624 we need to get this matter resolved before the transfer deadline
7534625 if berbatov goes we will need time to sign a replacement we want to have the best centre forward we can possibly get
7534626 no this is not yet my inter my inter finishes the match at the right time they win 2 0 and not by a narrow margin
7534627 they say that it is not possible to play beautiful football here but inter and roma showed exactly the opposite four goals lots of chances and enjoyable moves
7534628 coaches are all the same they always ask for more and another winger could be useful
7534629 he would give us another option with two advanced wingers and a centre forward anyway it wont be a drama if quaresma does not arrive
7534630 i felt bad it was tough but we were aiming to finish second and i did it
7534631 it was not easy for lewis but he did the job
7534632 again we suffered with a reliability problem this time on kimis car which lost us precious points
7534633 now we have to find out what happened in yet another engine failure and then decide how to react
7534634 clearly what happened is serious and we will have to do all in our power to make up for the ground we have lost through reliability problems in the coming races
7534635 the most positive element for us was that the boxes containing our spare parts were kept closed all weekend
7534636 we didnt need to fit a single replacement part throughout a race weekend that everyone thought would be full of crashes
7534637 now we can work hard for the final third of the season which begins with the back to back races at spa and monza two particularly challenging circuits that will put maximum stress on the engines
7534638 our presentation of a replacement candidate is conditional upon receipt of our fee and within ten working days of the initial candidates employment
7534639 opportunists and charlatans try to take the of the government
7534640 in our time world powers try to monopolize globalization now that they cant stop globalization of mankind but it is our duty and our mission to guide mankind to the radiant peaks and the secret behind it is connecting the mankind to the imam of the era
7534641 some are engaged in a campaign of lies and propaganda and try to present a violent and unfitting picture of the imam of the era the widespread claim that two thirds of the mankind will fall by the sword of the imam of the era before society can be reformed is a lie and propaganda they say such things in order to prevent mankind to listen to the true message of the imam of the era which they know would transform the masses
7534642 in those places and where ever i went people shouted god is great echoing the slogans of the iranian nation
7534643 raised the banner of imam hussein and your slogan is the same as that of imam hussein at the day of ashura
7534644 futile georgian ambassador to iran praises the islamic republics stance in conflict
7534645 they told me that the signature of one of these people did not seem genuine and could have been forged
7534646 but because i am a christian i do not force things when i fail this time i try next time
7534647 i have always wanted to serve my country in parliament so when i came back and rpf had already finished its nominations i decided to submit as an independent candidate
7534648 even if it will take 10 years because i have a very tangible program that i want implemented
7534649 i have support across a wide section of rwandan society especially the youth
7534650 i have worked with youths in several capacities and they know my abilities as somebody who will change their lives
7534651 that is why they will vote for me in big numbers
7534652 scientists urgently call for greater precaution to protect health from pervasive emf exposure hazards until biologically based standards are in effect
7534653 indicate that an exposure to 50 hz emf acts as a stressing factor on bacteria which can represent a suitable model to investigate acute and chronic effects related to elf emf exposure
7534654 as many as 22 basestations within 500 metres of victims homes
7534655 teenagers who send more than five text messages a day on their mobile phones or make more than five calls are ruining their chances of getting a good nights sleep
7534656 children especially pre adolescent children use land lines whenever possible keeping the use of cellphones for essential purposes only limiting the length of cellphone calls and using headsets or hands free options whenever possible
7534657 while scientists were pretty dismissive of any risk years ago with the accumulation of studies it appears people who have been using their phones for a long period of time are at greater risk of certain kinds of brain tumours there is a pattern emerging
7534658 the result is a complex picture where some studies show effects on the blood brain barrier whereas others do not possible mechanisms for the interactions between electromagnetic fields and the living organisms are discussed demonstrated effects on the blood brain barrier as well as a series of other effects upon biology have caused societal anxiety continued research is needed to come to an understanding of how these possible effects can be neutralized or at least reduced furthermore it should be kept in mind that proven effects on biology also should have positive potentials e g for medical use
7534659 these results demonstrate significant cognitive and neurobiological alterations pointing to a higher genuine individual vulnerability of electromagnetic hypersensitive patients
7534660 this is the first study showing that molecular level changes might take place in human volunteers in response to exposure to rf emf our study confirms that proteomics screening approach can identify protein targets of rf emf in human volunteers
7534661 i would not want to be a heavy user of a mobile phone i think the evidence that has accumulated is pointing towards an effect of mobile phones on tumours people might be shocked to hear that the evidence does seem to be coming more strongly in support of harmful effects

7535084 damage to nxp is not the result of the publication of the article but of the production and sale of a chip that appears to have shortcomings
7535085 we will take any decision up to terminating relations entirely
7535086 cooperation is above all in the interests of nato not russia
7535087 we want our relations to be full fledged and those of partners but we do not want an illusion of partnership
7535088 naturally we are not happy with being surrounded by military bases and being told do not worry everythings fine let alone with the latest events
7535089 these lease agreements are great news for princeton and for the entire central new jersey region in a challenging economy and office market
7535090 the building was recently renovated and weve been able to dramatically increase the occupancy
7535091 the economy could have an impact on how we deal with our corporates but it presents an interesting opportunity
7535092 everyone will want solutions that focus on doing more with less if the roi is attractive and helps reduce overhead thats where the success will be
7535093 the economic situation is the overriding factor in any technology investment for banks and corporates today
7535094 any technology initiative is under more scrutiny around its roi but streamlining the interactive supply chain is a value to corporates and they understand this
7535095 but there is a recognition that if a supplier needs faster working capital turnaround there is a greater willingness and recognition that it is a co equal in the supply chain ecosystem as we build the global supply chain for key buyers suppliers and financial intermediaries they will all see they have a stake in making it work efficiently its a mentality that will grow
7535096 the trend among our customers is that they are looking at ways to optimize their processes
7535097 visibility portals are where the buyers and suppliers meet and exchange bills and invoices
7535098 the biggest technology today in this area is around client access the ability of banks clients to access a plethora of services offered by the financial institution
7535099 this is beyond a web portal because youre offering different services and the ability to settle in different markets where the portal lets you check transactions and pay
7535100 it connects corporates erp enterprise resource planning systems to the portal their positive pay to the portal they can do reconciliation and can move to different liquidity activities its like a portal on steroids
7535101 the buy side learns to survive in the post credit crisis environment
7535102 theres been a general decline in the trust and the faith that the investors have in the rating agencies standard amp poors moodys investor services and fitch
7535103 the onus is on the investor to perform their own credit risk assessment rather than rely on the rating agencies
7535104 institutional investors realize they have to weigh in with their own intelligence and scrutiny of the underlying data to determine the riskiness of the issues so theyre spending money on the data and databases
7535105 theyre calculating their own expected risk adjusted rate of return they expect on these securities based on their analysis of the creditworthiness of the issuers
7535106 its a question of what do you want to spend your money on do you want to spend your money on a room of expensive talent or can you use their data and spend your money more efficiently
7535107 clients consultants prospects are looking at a new paradigm but the fact is that the rating agencies are dead and you have to do all original work
7535108 i am pleased that felicia has joined our staff she brings to fordham experience as a head and assistant coach on both the college and high school levels her knowledge recruiting network in the virginia area will be valuable as we continue to build our national footprint
7535109 she wasnt born with a golden microphone before her mouth shes paid her dues galaxy girl is famous throughout this galaxy or at least on the richmond airwaves and in the greater cyberspace nebula for her fine taste in music and her skill at staying awake when most of us are asleep
7535110 i told my mother i wish i could get that scholarship
7535111 she always told me do well in school and you can accomplish whatever you want
7535112 the perception of the hamptons is that everyone out here is very privileged but its not true
7535113 no one wouldve believed that beneath a middle eastern desert extraterrestrials were conducting a vast worldwide surveillance operation
7535114 we believed that militants were using the sector launching raids from within a tunnel complex
7535115 our mission was to flush them out and seal the tunnels as we neared our point man saw an odd looking silvery metal glinting in the sun
7535116 the air was thick as if it hadnt been exposed to the outside in some time
7535117 fearing a trap we unshouldered our weapons and moved forward cautiously
7535118 gray bulbous headed monstrosities with black inhuman eyes just like ive seen in your paper
7535119 the ets regarded me coldly one slowly raised his long slender fingers in the universal gesture of peace then he beckoned me toward the room i reluctantly lowered my weapon and followed i looked at the monitors a kaleidoscope of intense images showed a grim tapestry of our world at war
7535120 it sounded like camel gibberish to my ears yet i heard him clearly in my mind
7535121 traditionally people of earth have believed us to be warlike aggressors the truth is we are pacifists by nature just ask our good friends the venusians that is why we remain hidden from your primitive space probe landers and why we remain hidden here
7535122 we have been on your earth for centuries observing the human capacity for violence hate and self destruction
7535123 despite our advanced intellect we have not yet found a cure for this curse you inflict on your world
7535124 i fear perhaps one day you will make war on the rest of the solar system that is why we will continue to study this plague and try to find a cure
7535125 then this earth of yours will be quarantined like germs in a petri dish
7535126 the martian told us that in two minutes the tunnel and its occupants would teleport to some other war zone
7535127 we hustled out just as the sands began to shift wildly the ground shook violently as if an earthquake was upon us moments later the desert collapsed on tunnels that were no longer occupied by the martians and their equipment
7535128 naturally i told my superiors what i had seen and heard
7535129 group plans often negotiate lower payment rates than other consumers are billed
7535130 while the us economy has avoided recession to date the major economies are experiencing a generalized slowdown weaker demand in the major economies coupled with the need to contain inflationary pressures will dampen growth in the fast growing asia economies
7535131 die toleranz die reichweite und inhalt der freiheit erweiterte stets parteilich intolerant gegen ber den wortf hrern des unterdr ckenden status quo
7535132 toleranz gegen ber dem radikal b sen erscheint jetzt gut weil sie dem zusammenhalt des ganzen dient auf dem wege zum berflu oder zu gr erem berflu die nachsicht gegen ber der systematischen verdummung von kindern wie von erwachsenen durch reklame und propaganda die freisetzung von unmenschlicher zerst render gewalt in vietnam das rekrutieren und die ausbildung von sonderverb nden die ohnm chtige und wohlwollende toleranz gegen ber unverbl mten betrug beim warenkauf gegen ber verschwendung und geplantem veralten von g tern sind keine verzerrungen und abweichungen sondern das wesen eines systems das toleranz bef rdert als ein mittel den kampf ums dasein zu verewigen und die alternativen zu unterdr cken im namen von erziehung moral und psychologie entr stet man sich laut ber die zunahme der jugendkriminalit t weniger laut ber die kriminalit t immer m chtigerer geschosse raketen und bomben das reifgewordene verbrechen einer ganzen zivilisation
7535133 im rahmen einer solchen sozialstruktur l t sich toleranz ben und verk nden und zwar 1 als passive duldung verfestigter und etablierter haltungen und ideen auch wenn ihre sch digende auswirkung auf mensch und natur auf der hand liegt und 2 als aktive offizielle toleranz die der rechten wie der linken gew hrt wird aggressiven ebenso wie pazifistischen bewegungen der partei des hasses ebenso wie der der menschlichkeit
7535134 da man imstande ist zu entscheiden was man tun und lassen was man erleiden und was man nicht erleiden will
7535135 sondern darin die gesellschaft herbeizuf hren worin der mensch nicht an institutionen versklavt ist welche die selbstbestimmung von vornherein beeintr chtigen
7535136 diese toleranz kann allerdings nicht unterschiedslos und gleich sein hinsichtlich der inhalte des ausdrucks in wort und tat sie kann nicht falsche worte und unrechte taten sch tzen die demonstrierbar den m glichkeiten der befreiung widersprechen und entgegenwirken solche unterschiedslose toleranz ist gerechtfertigt in harmlosen debatten bei der unterhaltung in der akademischen diskussion sie ist unerl lich im wissenschaftsbetrieb in der privaten religion aber die gesellschaft kann nicht dort unterschiedslos verfahren wo die befriedung des daseins wo freiheit und gl ck selbst auf dem spiel stehen hier k nnen bestimmte dinge nicht gesagt bestimmte ideen nicht ausgedr ckt bestimmte politische ma nahmen nicht vorgeschlagen ein bestimmtes verhalten nicht gestattet werden ohne da man toleranz zu einem instrument der fortdauer von knechtschaft macht
7535137 der ununterrichtete darf ebenso lange reden wie der unterrichtete und propaganda geht einher mit erziehung wahrheit mit falschheit diese reine toleranz von sinn und unsinn wird durch das demokratische argument gerechtfertigt da niemand ob gruppe oder individuum im besitz der wahrheit und imstande w re zu bestimmen was recht und unrecht ist gut und schlecht
7535138 f r die recht und unrecht wahr und falsch vorherbestimmt sind wo immer sie die lebensinteressen der gesellschaft ber hren
7535139 das ist vor allem ausdruck und aller kommunikation ein semantischer tatbestand blockiert wird die effektive abweichung die anerkennung dessen was nicht dem establishment angeh rt das beginnt in der sprache die ver ffentlicht und verordnet wird
7535140 weit wahrscheinlicher ist es jedoch da sie die etablierte these st rken und die alternativen abwehren
7535141 n mlich die eine geistige haltung zu f rdern die dazu tendiert den unterschied zwischen wahr und falsch information und propaganda recht und unrecht zu verwischen
7535142 normalen gang der ereignisse der der gang verwalteter ereignisse ist sowie durch die darin geformte mentalit t
7535143 wenn eine zeitschrift nebeneinander einen negativen und einen positiven bericht ber den fbi abdruckt dann erf llt sie ehrlich die erfordernisse der objektivit t es ist jedoch mit wahrscheinlichkeit anzunehmen da der positive das rennen macht weil das image der institution dem bewu tsein des volkes tief eingepr gt ist oder wenn ein nachrichtensprecher ber die folterung und ermordung von menschen die f r die b rgerrechte eintraten in dem gleichen gesch ftlichen tonfall berichtet dessen er sich bedient wenn er den aktienmarkt oder das wetter beschreibt oder mit der gleichen gro en gem tsbewegung mit der er seine reklamespr che aufsagt dann ist solche objektivit t unecht mehr noch sie verst t gegen humanit t und wahrheit weil sie dort ruhig ist wo man w tend sein sollte und sich dort der anklage enth lt wo diese in den tatsachen selbst enthalten ist die in solcher unparteilichkeit ausgedr ckte toleranz dient dazu die herrschende intoleranz und unterdr ckung m glichst klein darzustellen oder gar freizusprechen
7535144 die richtung zu bestimmen in der die herrschenden institutionen politischen praktiken und meinungen ge ndert werden m ten um die chance eines friedens zu vergr ern der nicht mit kaltem krieg identisch ist sowie einer befriedigung der bed rfnisse die nicht von armut unterdr ckung und ausbeutung lebt es ist dem zufolge auch m glich politische praktiken meinungen und bewegungen zu bestimmen die diese chance bef rdern w rden und diejenigen die das gegenteil t ten
7535145 foreign cyclists drawn by the beauty of our country find practically nothing for them
7535146 we must intensify our efforts hoping nobody accuses us of excesses or of wanting to militarize the city

7535149 a lot of our performance directors have really delivered so its not going to be surprising for their phones to be ringing
7535150 we have some of the best in the world there will be many other countries who will want to poach them from us national governing bodies so they can negotiate contracts to sign them up now for 2012 it cannot be done on a year by year basis

7535154 we believe that it would be a mistake to suspend all nato russian contacts at a time when they are so much needed

7535163 the most important threat to independent journalists in mexico is the same threat faced by society as a whole organised crime
7535164 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits

7535170 na poca o mercado brasileiro era fechado n o pod amos importar ent o fizemos uma concess o de uso da marca tudo era fabricado aqui
7535171 o mais importante foi que a fiorucci abriu o mercado de jeans para o aparecimento de marcas nacionais como f rum e zoomp
7535172 a poca da fiorucci foi muito criativa agora diferente a ind stria muito competitiva as margens s o pequenas s o outras regras um cen rio dif cil para a ind stria de moda brasileira
7535173 ela brilha muito mas n o vende gera uma m dia enorme proporcionalmente mais at do que em outros pa ses como a fran a mas a visibilidade n o corresponde ao faturamento das empresas do setor
7535174 ainda n o temos marcas brasileiras com exce o de havaianas e h stern conhecidas l fora
7535175 o quadro ruim e eu tenho alertado o setor e o governo sobre isso
7535176 hoje isso est invertido a rua que influencia os outros dois todos os grandes nomes as grandes marcas est o indo s ruas observar e o resultado uma moda m ltipla com muitas caras ent o quando me perguntam o que est na moda hoje eu respondo para que tribo
7535177 n o se usa mais uma pe a para expressar que voc pertence a alguma categoria mas sim para expressar a sua individualidade
7535178 consumir moda em determinadas regi es representa a oportunidade daquelas pessoas de n o pertencerem mais a uma categoria e sim terem sua individualidade

7535182 their aerial play is a topic that worries all of us we know that their strong point in attack is in the air and we have to try and counteract it
7535183 in spite of the players theyll be missing they have a team with players of quite a good level and also have substitutes well have to see how they are at game time but we have to take care of ourselves and try to set the rhythm of the match
7535184 theres not much time left to get ready for the game weve been looking forward to it for a long time our main orders are to be patient because we can come back in this round
7535185 we dont need to recall the games against bolton and valencia all matches are different and were talking about different seasons we have to set the rhythm of the match and be stuck in at all times in order to earn a good result
7535186 its our dearest wish that mamadou wears the national jersey again not only to give him pleasure but his fellow citizens too
7535187 only god knows if he will play against algeria and its something we will discuss when we return to france but he knows that he needs his country just as his country needs him
7535188 he has trained well and will be in the squad for madrid whether he plays or not id rather not say
7535189 we have greeted him quite normally he part of our team
7535190 i think he will be useful to us just like he was in years gone by
7535191 they seem to be more common nowadays because of the high divorce rate
7535192 second marriages also come with more children assets so it is important to define the rights and obligations before stepping into a legal arrangement such as marriage
7535193 it is not unusual for parents to be the motivating force behind a pre nuptial agreement
7535194 often a parent requires the child to have a pre nup to protect a prospective gift or inheritance
7535195 prenuptial agreements are used by parties to organize many aspects of their married lives when push comes to shove however most of these lifestyle arrangements are probably unenforceable in a court
7535196 we had a couple enter a prenuptial agreement that provided that the parties would never own pets
7535197 we had another agreement that provided that the wife would have the discretion to own as many pets as she wished without objection by the husband we have had numerous agreements wherein the parties agreed as to household chores such as the husband agreeing to do the dishes and the wife agreeing to do the cooking
7535198 technically you can put these provisions in the prenup but they are unenforceable so what is the point
7535199 should people bother with these agreements probably so if they have an issue that seems so important to them as to warrant a serious discussion even though they may not hold up in the courtroom they usually hold up at home most people honor their agreements and voluntarily live up to their commitments
7535200 in the process of having to do twice as much as an actively partnered parent many a single parent becomes doubly dedicated to their childrens growth exerting an extremely powerful motivating influence in their lives some of the very best run families i have seen have had a single parent at the helm
7535201 an intact family does not always guarantee a successful and happy child the quantity of parents is less important than the quality of parenting
7535202 just distant i dont think its good or bad theres not much there
7535203 every parent who is stitting in the stands wants their child to do their best
7535204 michael phelps mom should win a mother of the year award
7535205 dont bet on the prince how to have the man you want by betting on yourself
7535206 she single handedly raised three kids and since michael had learning disabilities she gave him one thing on which he could focus and call his own his swimming the phelps experience shows how survival is all about rising above anger and hostility toward an ex and getting on with your life the best revenge is doing well
7535207 this certainly disproves the myth about kids having trouble when coming from broken homes
7535208 its all in the parenting and direction we give our children whatever their immediate surroundings

7535221 in 1869 the lord chamberlains office issues new guidelines governing the wearing of court dress and in an effort to standardise the appearance of gentlemen attending at court prescribed for the first a suit of clothes cut from black silk velvet and trimmed with cut steel buttons hither to court uniform has consisted of a coat and breeches of superfine cloth worn with a floral waistcoat this in turn had descended from the lavishly decorated court clothes worn during the reign of king george iii this new more restrained style of dress became the regulation uniform for high sheriffs and retained some of the elements of dress from a previous age amongst these was a species of folding cocked hat known as a chapeau bras which had first made its appearance in the dying years of the eighteenth century and the black silk rosette worn at the back of the neck the last vestige of the bag wig of the 1740s the coat itself echoed the style of the 1780s though the advancement of nineteenth century tailoring techniques lent a more fitted silhouette to this later garment to offset this more sober uniform a great variety of cut steel buttons shoe buckles and sword hilts were produced allowing the wearer to express his personal taste today henry poole amp co make shrieval court dress to much the same standards set a century or more ago whether for ladies or gentlemen each suit is fully bespoke cut and handmade from the finest italian velvet trimmed with a choice of buttons and shoe buckles in the correct court patterns for ladies we offer a design service and are happy to advise on style and choice of material

7535227 the u s economy is still facing challenges to economic growth but no matter what stage the economy is in building trust with your partner concerning finances is a process that can be managed and remains imperative at all times
7535228 how couples handle finances while theyre married usually reflects attitudes and habits they formed long ago observing their own families
7535229 the problem is bad enough when their styles dont match then proactive financial planning budgeting discussion counseling and self awareness often can help if the spending is just about spending and the partners are open to honest discussion compromise etc
7535230 in all situations and especially with disproportionate earnings between partners steps should be taken so that both partners have equal knowledge and authority of their system for spending and saving it is important to have a discussion identifying the values each person attaches to their finances and how they can work together to achieve those goals making financial decisions as a team from the beginning ensures that both partners have equal knowledge this increases the level of trust between them and provides a system of checks and balances
7535231 when that mismatch of styles is not discussed respected analyzed acknowledged when its discounted belittled or ignored when the spending spouse has no ability or real intention of changing her or his actions to help meet the financial emotional needs of the other whether it be for security investment or savings then you have a classic standoff his need to spend invest provide as he alone sees fit versus her needs for security investment savings
7535232 a married person who habitually spending more he makes and runs up debt or borrows from future earnings retirement whether its hidden or not and knows that this is contrary to his spouses wishes is being unfaithful to the health of the marriage relationship he is demonstrating a lack of respect reciprocity prudence honesty especially if he knows that that style of money management is distressing to his spouse thats why he may hide spending or he may do it without hiding but saying im the boss tough about your feelings on the subject either way its a kind of financial infidelity

7535313 we understand that some in the news media are more interested in reporting the rumor of controversy than the fact of unity the fact is that our teams are working closely to ensure a successful convention and will continue to do so senator and president clinton fully support the obama biden ticket and look forward to addressing the convention and the nation on the urgency of victory this fall anyone saying anything else doesnt know what theyre talking about period

7535460 think of all the hate there is in red china
7535461 my impression is obama thinks that if we leave somehow the iraqis are going to have an epiphany of peaceful coexistence among warring sects i ve seen zero evidence of that
7535462 this terrain is already so rugged why did the chinese need to add a wall to prevent foreigners from entering their country

7535464 cottage cheese in a lime yet another policy position that shows mccain is in fact running for bushs third term
7535465 limited due diligence and there being no material adverse change in the business and business assets of vmetro before the launch of the offer
7535466 one of the reasons for it was the debris that accumulated on the fence itself
7535467 while the bush administration may claim its taking environmental impacts of the border wall into consideration building wire mesh fences across washes prone to debris laden floods is fundamentally flawed
7535468 it doesnt take an expert hydrologist to anticipate the potential for these walls to become like dams
7535469 especially in flash flood type of storms where a lot of water and debris are generated very quickly and can pile up against the fences very rapidly
7535470 we are still required to follow every environmental rule regulation and policy
7535471 he does not waive us doing what we would have to do without the waiver so it doesnt change anything in the environment
7535472 the monument had suggested that they take into consideration everything that can happen with a weather event

7535495 we recognize it is a growing concern and were taking it very seriously
7535496 new york citys drinking water continues to meet all federal and state regulations regarding drinking water quality in the watershed and the distribution system
7535497 septic systems are essentially small treatment plants that are essentially unmanaged and therefore tend to fail
7535498 people think that if they take a medication their body absorbs it and it disappears but of course thats not the case
7535499 based on what we now know i would say we find theres little or no risk from pharmaceuticals in the environment to human health
7535500 theres no doubt about it pharmaceuticals are being detected in the environment and there is genuine concern that these compounds in the small concentrations that theyre at could be causing impacts to human health or to aquatic organisms
7535501 it brings a question to peoples minds that if the fish were affected might there be a potential problem for humans
7535502 it could be that the fish are just exquisitely sensitive because of their physiology or something we havent gotten far enough along
7535503 i think its a shame that so much money is going into monitoring to figure out if these things are out there and so little is being spent on human health
7535504 they need to just accept that these things are everywhere every chemical and pharmaceutical could be there its time for the epa to step up to the plate and make a statement about the need to study effects both human and environmental
7535505 we realize that we have a limited amount of data on the concentrations
7535506 were going to be able to learn a lot more
7535507 these are chemicals that are designed to have very specific effects at very low concentrations thats what pharmaceuticals do so when they get out to the environment it should not be a shock to people that they have effects
7535508 we know we are being exposed to other peoples drugs through our drinking water and that cant be good
7535509 were grateful for steves extensive background in the healthcare industry including this latest achievement

7535525 being included in the inc 5000 for a second consecutive year is a significant achievement for our company
7535526 we are excited about our continued growth and to be ranked among some of the most elite companies in the country
7535527 the inc 5000 provides the most comprehensive look ever at the most important part of the economy the entrepreneurial part
7535528 the expansion of the list has allowed us to tell the stories of larger companies older companies and a wealth of companies in the industries like manufacturing and construction that are underreported in the business media
7535529 some of the most exciting aspects of the show were the opportunity to meet with several global distributors who requested product information for the sole purpose of nationwide distribution

7535535 theres no doubt he can start a test hes perfectly capable of that
7535536 it was great for timana to get the time that he got
7535537 we delayed his entry obviously and deferred to the blokes who had the background of test rugby first with the initial replacement option
7535538 but when timana got in the game my first instinct was that he did really well having watched it live
7535539 well have a look at the footage and pour over it and contemplate our combinations and what we believe will work for us
7535540 i think ive taken my opportunities this year so hopefully if i get a spot we can make it another good win
7535541 i see myself as a 13 but obviously stirlings captain and also had a great game but i could slot in at 12 or any other place in the backline
7535542 you never call at this time so this must really be something
7535543 i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us
7535544 he comes from a middle class background he went to school on scholarships he had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about child care they had to figure out how to start a college fund for their kids
7535545 stop the torture stop the war thats what were fighting for

7535571 these developments are placing severe pressure on australias competitive position in high performance sport
7535572 sport in this country is at the crossroads and the next few months provide the government with the opportunity to make its mark on the system and to leave a legacy of sporting success into the future
7535573 the single major change i believe that is needed is for the genuine amalgamation of the various programs and activities of the australian institute of sport and the state and territory institutes and academies of sport into one integrated system
7535574 this needs to be complemented by increased spending on talent identification sports science and sports medicine and support for coaches
7535575 we need to sharpen our funding focus on highly ranked athletes and sports at the expense of non performers and grants for national sporting organisations need to be increased and indexed
7535576 it will be an important issue for the review but so will be many other issues like how to get more young kids involved in organised sports and creating strong pathways from local junior sports into the more senior levels
7535577 are there areas of fragmentation i mean of course the federal government puts a lot of resources into sport but so do our state governments and then so do our sporting organisations are there ways that we can better co operate and make that money go further
7535578 the government will be long term funding partners with the aoc australian olympic committee with the australian institute of sport in the lead up to the london games and to the games beyond that as well
7535579 we compete well at olympics we believe in getting behind our athletes we do the right thing but at the same time we want to broaden out the community participation in sport as well
7535580 the jewel on the crown of love has started to lit the darkness of universe

7535582 tomorrow when i am back at the club i will discuss these things
7535583 it is important to be focused before a game last week we only talked about wigan but tomorrow i will talk about players
7535584 tomorrow when i come into the club i will discuss this or that who comes who goes
7535585 first we finished the game now we get back to london and i start a new week
7535586 if deco is scoring goals or if lampard is scoring goals is not important what is important is if chelsea win
7535587 chelsea is more important than us they are friends and if one scores the other players are happy
7535588 i read that lampard in the last two or three seasons has scored 20 goals every year this season maybe 25 but maybe 15 or 10 maybe even five it is not important if chelsea win
7535589 the word twat was used in context it was meant to be a nasty word on purpose because this is a nasty character
7535590 however jacqueline doesnt want to offend her readers or her readers parents so when the book comes to be reprinted the word will be replaced with twit
7535591 everyone was polite and seemed interested but no one offered to raise money to build her
7535592 when i was growing up i felt the dragons were my family
7535593 but today the dragons are angry with us and see us as enemies
7535594 we dont want the komodo dragon to be domesticated its against natural balance
7535595 we have to keep this conservation area for the purpose of wildlife it is not for human beings
7535596 if we let the locals hunt again the dragons will be gone
7535597 if we are not strict in enforcing the ban everything here will be destroyed
7535598 we threw branches and stones to drive him away but the dragon was crazed with blood and just wouldnt let go

7535600 certainly if these allegations are proven then we are certainly into the territory of looking at not only his future at that club but his future in the game
7535601 if that happens then clubs are able to act more quickly than in situations where the version of events are in dispute
7535602 obviously these are very serious allegations i certainly support the action of the sharks in standing the player down
7535603 its certainly disappointing in terms of the series of allegations that have been made and its now a matter for the courts to sort out
7535604 there is nothing going on ive been out all day enjoy your sunday
7535605 pretty much that there was an incident at his unit involving some guests that were staying there and he wasnt involved
7535606 but obviously the matter is a legal matter it is a bit of a kick in the teeth luckily ive still got my teeth
7535607 to be part of the game in this its centenary season is a special honour for every player in the game today and we are very much aware of that
7535608 its a reminder to us that we represent not only our hopes and dreams and those of todays fans but that we have been lucky enough to inherit something that is truly great the greatest game of all
7535609 on behalf of todays players i would like to pay tribute to the champions who dug the well and i offer our commitment that we will in turn do everything in our power to pass rugby league on to the next generation in even better shape than it is today

7535613 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7535614 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7535615 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7535616 no loco vos sos un boludo y no sabes nada chau
7535617 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7535618 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7535619 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7535620 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7535621 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7535622 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7535623 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7535624 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7535625 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7535626 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7535627 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7535628 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7535629 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7535630 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7535631 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7535632 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7535633 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7535634 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7535635 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7535636 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7535637 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7535638 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7535639 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7535640 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7535641 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7535642 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7535643 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7535644 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7535645 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7535646 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7535647 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7535648 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7535649 the neck is fine and 100 but he has lost a lot of weight hes well underdone in terms of conditioning
7535650 we will take some guidance from the player himself on whether hes mentally ready but i think he has been in the game long enough to know he would only go out there if he was confident he could be an effective player

7535656 she did so much to keep everyone in the family happy even though there were problems
7535657 i saw how desperate these people are and how much theyre struggling
7535658 this was my grandmas funeral though this wasnt the time or the place
7535659 we did the best we could and we put the rest in gods hands kedar was blessed
7535660 he put a lot of holes in the walls and broke the back door that way
7535661 he popped his older brother on his head from far away and gave taru a good knot
7535662 we thought he was lost so we called the police
7535663 kedar was a sweet kid trying to make his mama happy usually
7535664 my grandma let us stay at her house until we started to miss our mama that was the kind of thing she did for us so that everybody was happy

7535670 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7535671 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7535672 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7535673 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7535674 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7535675 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7535676 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7535677 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7535678 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7535679 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7535680 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7535681 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7535682 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7535683 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7535684 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7535685 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7535686 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7535687 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7535688 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7535689 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7535690 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7535691 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7535692 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7535693 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7535694 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7535695 i still believe its an advantage if you know how to win a u s open
7535696 i think he definitely didnt have his best day against me but playing him nine times i guess hes bound to have one off day out of all of them because there are times when i felt like there was nothing i could do
7535697 the goal is still the same and the pressure is still the same
7535698 the goal is to continue to improve my tennis and to continue playing a very good tournament
7535699 rafa will now feel what i had to feel for a very long time
7535700 so it will be interesting to see how he handles it but so far hes been great and hes played so well on all surfaces now maybe its nice to go into a grand slam for a change not having no 1 next to me and it should be interesting
7535701 i think its tough to play perfect for five years in a row
7535702 i think one big result and its turned around for him i know pretty much every player except for one that would take his bad year so i think you have to use a little bit of perspective hes created a monster for himself
7535703 thats the plan but i dont think either one of us is aiming for two
7535704 everything that you get in this game youve earned whether it be a touchdown a win whatever it is
7535705 in some sense it is satisfying in that light but trust me theres a lot of work ahead and i know that probably just as much as everybody around here theres going to be some ups and downs but youve just got to stay mentally tough and grind through it thats where my mind set is right now
7535706 we feel like he gives us the best chance to win
7535707 hes picked up our system ill have to keep repeating this but its a learning curve for a quarterback in this league hes going to see some things he hasnt seen before but i think matt is the kind of guy who might get fooled once but the next time it comes up hes going to be able to handle it i really anticipate that we wont see the gaffes that a lot of people think
7535708 he just shook it off and said im glad i got that one out of the way in the preseason
7535709 hes got a very good outlook about the game of football hes got a good understanding to play quarterback in this league hes prepared for it hes mature beyond his years and itll be a great season for him to come in and be out leader
7535710 hes going to have his growing pains just like anybody
7535711 you look at peyton manning in his first year he struggled i just hope the fans and the media give this guy a chance hes not going to go out there and be a hall of famer every game this year hes going to have some mistakes and were going to help him out as much as possible
7535712 were going to play against some really good players and theres really good coaches on other teams as well
7535713 so theres going to be good schemes and sometimes were not going to be at our best but youve got to learn from those mistakes and youve got to understand that theyre going to happen and youve got to bounce back from them as quickly as you can
7535714 the way this works is a real smart racer explained it to me this way after he wrecked me and i was real mad he said i just had to look at your rear bumper and decide would you do this to me and you had before so it was a real simple decision
7535715 earlier in the year we had a nationwide race and kyle was a lot faster than me and he went ahead and got to my back bumper and just smoked the back bumper of my car and sent me up the race track
7535716 afterwards he said sorry man my car was just faster so in my mind i had to ask myself when i went down there in the corner should i lift and brake early and do the best i can or should i just kind of give him a little tap and see what happens
7535717 so thats the way it went and thats the decision i made id do it again
7535718 it was all going fine there till the end just a tough break for us and this m amp ms toyota team steve addington crew chief and the guys built us a fabulous race car
7535719 we could get through traffic way better than anybody and it was really a cool car to have and be able to work with
7535720 heres the deal that doesnt mean anything hes raced me that way and thats the reason it went down like that
7535721 its nascars decision and their discretion he spun me out so i just you know got into him a little bit and let him know that i didnt appreciate the way he passed me and he retaliated and ended up spinning me out so couldnt tell you
7535722 we had a good car but we didnt have a car that could run with the 18 kyle busch or 99 carl edwards it seemed like on the long runs we were as good as the 99 but the 18 seemed to be the class of the field
7535723 it was a solid day and we did what we had to i didnt have to really race guys too hard and guys really didnt race me too hard it was a good day for us
7535724 i just had to ask myself would he do that to me
7535725 and he has before they keep talking about rivalries we might have one now
7535726 its just his normal fashion thats fine ive grown to know that now you know to pass a guy to hit him getting into the corners and chatter his tires is what he did
7535727 thats what happened its too bad we tore up the car a little bit after the race but i guess he wasnt happy about it and i can understand
7535728 i dont know what happened in front of me two cars got together
7535729 i was getting into the corner and the car behind me just didnt see it and ran over me
7535730 we had a good race car and its a shame we got caught up in that mess
7535731 the crash happened so fast i just saw cars wrecking everywhere in front of me and there was nothing that i could do
7535732 our collective future has to be negotiated in open conversations so that we escape the complacency of self and discover ourselves again in the larger context of life

7535737 dies hat auswirkungen auf die beschaffungskosten von erdgas und damit zwangsl ufig auf die einheimischen erdgaspreise
7535738 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7535739 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7535740 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7535741 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7535742 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7535743 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7535744 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7535745 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

7535773 parkinson ist eine kostspielige krankheit und stellt sowohl f r das betreuungspersonal als auch f r die gesellschaft als ganzes eine riesige belastung dar regierungen m ssen erkennen dass das ergreifen von massnahmen die diese belastung verringern und menschen die beste zur verf gung stehende betreuung und behandlung zuteil werden lassen wirtschaftlich und sozial gesehen den meisten sinn ergibt
7535774 in europa gibt es beinahe 1 2 millionen menschen die mit parkinson leben und mit einer zunehmend lter werdenden bev lkerung wird diese zahl steigen es ist zeit die ungleichheiten bei der betreuung und behandlung der krankheit anzusprechen und das leben jener die von parkinson betroffen sind jetzt und zuk nftig zu verbessern
7535775 es berrascht mich immer wieder wie parkinson auf sozialer ebene so sichtbar sein kann und dennoch f r die gesellschaft unsichtbar zu sein scheint dies ist ein r cksichtsloser zustand und hilfe wird in ganz europa ben tigt diese initiative der epda ist von bedeutung wir m ssen das verst ndnis erh hen wir m ssen den bekanntheitsgrad steigern leute sollen nicht nur sehen sie sollen handeln

7535791 were the men and women who cover politics in washington and were disappearing fast
7535792 the major reasons contributing to the loss are energy cost soda ash prices and other domestic raw material and packing material prices
7535793 thus the steep increase in the tariff of any of these sources of fuel directly impacts the performance of the company
7535794 the international price of soda ash an imported raw material alone has gone up by 55 percent till the first quarter of the current financial year
7535795 in terms of exports the company will be focusing on specialty food and beverage bottles i e short run food and beverage bottles with colouring or decoration for value addition
7535796 the company is in a unique position in the asian market exporting boutique wine and specialty liquor bottles for leading brands in india its in the process of developing several such products for markets like uk australia south africa and usa
7535797 the management is positive about the future of the company
7535798 the initial loss situation is a temporary phenomena in the glass industry or industries with such a high capital expenditure as apart from the initial gestation period

7535800 we will not know the real magnitude of the problem until there are safeguards for people to file charges
7535801 during the past year weve been evaluating secure computings secure web along with appliances from other industry leading vendors
7535802 secure web gave us all of the features we needed without adding to our carbon footprint thats very important to us here in hawaii where energy costs are particularly high
7535803 in a school setting its obviously very important to have technology in place that blocks inappropriate and malicious content in our testing secure web consistently blocked threats effectively
7535804 trustedsource assigns reputation scores to internet hosts and devices based on their behavior much like a credit bureau assigns credit ratings to consumers
7535805 as a result secure web can stop spyware viruses phishing and other malware even if the site is in an allowed category and there is no available signature for the bad code
7535806 in the past we used separate products for reporting and filtering
7535807 with secure web well have one number to call for all of our support needs
7535808 punahou school has a well deserved reputation for excellence in both academics and athletics
7535809 because secure computing also has a reputation for being the best it seemed like a natural fit
7535810 we were really impressed with the secure web product and were convinced that its the solution that best meets our schools needs
7535811 lars did what he could but its hard to put pressure on the peloton in this race we kind of knew this beforehand but of course you still gotta give it a go and lars did a great job out there
7535812 that was an unbelievable fight up to the last meter today
7535813 the guys went totally to their limit sometimes even over it a big compliment on bjorn who thanks to his strong performance rewarded us with this enormous success
7535814 once you touchdown i want you to open this up and read it
7535815 he said with a withered voice trying to calm himself down pausing in between sentences to wipe his tears he passed her a small note and she took it amiably
7535816 the agency has determined that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment
7535817 it is unbelievable that the fdas first action on this issue is to turn to irradiation rather than focus on how to prevent contamination of these crops
7535818 instead of beefing up its capacity to inspect food facilities or test food for contamination all the fda has to offer consumers is an impractical ineffective and very expensive gimmick like irradiation
7535819 its the latest in a series of pr moves designed to mislead the public from the fact that the government is asleep at the wheel here
7535820 i dont know if courtney would have got through if it wasnt for blood donors
7535821 i have been donating blood for about 10 years but before courtney was born i didnt realise just how many lives are saved and how many people benefit from blood donation
7535822 its such a simple way for ordinary people to save lives
7535823 although winter is always a difficult time for the blood service as many of our regular donors are unable to give blood due to colds and flu it is highly unusual to call two appeals in one winter
7535824 appeals are only called when the blood service experiences severe shortages
7535825 recently collections have been on the decline and blood stocks are low in all blood groups
7535826 theres no substitute for blood we need to ensure people with cancer heart disease kidney and bowel disease premature babies and accident victims get the blood and blood products they need to survive
7535827 i am disappointed but i have to accept this i just couldnt go any faster the course was not hard enough for me
7535828 i felt really strong and confident after winning the tour of denmark on the road i was stronger then ever in the trainings last week so i expected to be racing for the medals for sure i have no idea what went wrong but i had no power at all
7535829 it was a long day for me because i dont usually go in breakaways but it was worth it now ive got the leaders jersey this is a protour race and so its pretty important
7535830 i dont think i can win the race because of the final time trial but with boasson hagen in second just behind me the team is in the best possible position for the final stages
7535831 im still feeling good and so hopefully i can win the sprint on monday as well and take another stage victory
7535832 it was a long day for me because i dont usually go in breakaways but it was worth it now ive got the leaders jersey this is a protour race and so its pretty important
7535833 i dont think i can win the race because of the final time trial but with boasson hagen in second just behind me the team is in the best possible position for the final stages

7535844 it really was a tropical storm which meant you know it shouldnt have been too too bad but were getting the water we always get the water and we always have to be careful of the water
7535845 while this is the first storm in over 50 years to make at least three landfalls in fact fay is going down in record books with four landfalls it is pretty unusual for such a storm to do so over florida

7536026 theres no doubt hes determined to get healthy and hes pretty close to making a decision and hes keen to play again
7536027 the first thing he needs to do is indicate he needs to play
7536028 as yet he hasnt put his name up but once his name is in there is a mechanism in place for the afl commission to hear his application
7536029 hes done enough work and hes been in for long enough and i think hell be competitive on saturday after what i saw last week when he trialled so well at geelong when he was only beaten a half length
7536030 we have two options we can either run him in the sprint race or the memsie i prefer the memsie because i think hes done enough work to cope with the trip and looking back on his past form he was a fine weight for age horse when they got him to his best
7536031 he had a flexi tendon problem behind the knee that was four years ago
7536032 i think weve got him right now and if he lets go hes a very smart horse on his day
7536033 hes got a great record in argentina but hes a really sluggish lazy galloper on the track
7536034 he sort of just does exactly what he has to do without breaking any records
7536035 i trialled him at flemington recently and he finished on terms with orange county so hes pretty forward but my major concern at this stage is getting a run
7536036 we have not really thought about how it felt then i just know that all the boys now are 100 competitive everyone is prepared to do the hard things on the pitch and that goes a long way when you are playing everyone showed against wellington they can work hard and grind out a result
7536037 we are really looking forward to a home game next friday its a short turnaround but we should have three players back archie thompson midfielder nick ward and goalkeeper michael theoklitos is close to being right i will have really enjoyable selection problems

7536045 its a great programme i got to work with 13 beautiful girls who wanted to prove that they are stronger than men and it got decent trps too
7536046 not at all i believe that women are stronger than men at all times
7536047 quote me on that any day she is definitely the stronger person between the two of us in fact marriage by far has been the most difficult stunt that ive performed in my life
7536048 hes just five right now he enjoys films and im enjoying fatherhood
7536049 yes i agree that there is a lot of money in the industry now and thats good for all of us the number of people whore going to the multiplexes to catch movies are unprecedented and im sure that all this money will increase by next year there are so many things that we can do with our films now we can make them hi tech experiment with good scripts and what not in fact i have my own production house now and its doing great too
7536050 these collaborations are about getting two cultures together and im doing them because people want to see it they want to see me rapping with snoop and work out other similar tie ups too abroad people really enjoy indian cinema i want to do more such things in the future

7536058 well be working very hard to create the right atmosphere downtown so every single night that youre in the city youll feel that youre in the magic
7536059 its embraced in our culture its part of our way of life in canada and we think its unlikely that people would not show up the goal of the organizing committee is to earn the respect of the public

7536091 a diet is a cure that doesnt work for a disease that doesnt exist
7536092 weight itself is not a health problem except in the most extreme cases
7536093 he makes no effort to do that and he is probably less healthy than i am
7536094 basically can opt out of their gym classes and eat fast food every other meal
7536095 is that child going to more than likely end up with diabetes now were seeing diabetes in people in their 20s 30s and 40s when it used to be a disease that hit people in their 60s

7536099 its finding what works for you finding what makes you feel healthy and fit
7536100 exercise alone wont do it you have to reduce calories too you need both sides of the equation to effect weight loss
7536101 it takes a lot of exercise to expend a lot of calories
7536102 there have been a number of studies that suggested dieting actually has a negative influence on weight loss success emotional health etc
7536103 you can lower your risk with good diet and exercise
7536104 but you cannot neutralize the effect of your excess body fat
7536105 just because youve heard over and over and over that fat kills doesnt mean its true
7536106 it just means that people in this culture really love saying it
7536107 i dont get incentives because i exercise five days a week and eat a vegetarian diet
7536108 but when im 400 pounds and smoke three packs of cigarettes a day and have raging blood sugar im going to pay the same amount in health insurance as you

7536110 they do the yo yo thing lose the weight then go off the wagon feel terribly guilty and depressed then they get it back
7536111 the olympics have showed chinas tremendous achievements and real openness compared to 10 years ago
7536112 the olympics has made us feel more lenient toward the outside world
7536113 i hope the country can now move beyond the century of shame and humiliation thinking and ditch all that stuff in its psyche for the past 60 years
7536114 although western reporters have encountered many problems the olympic openness is unprecedented
7536115 i think the pressure to open will outweigh the pressure to tighten after the games
7536116 top leaders will be congratulating themselves by basking in the light of success
7536117 the communist party has the power to mobilize society for the success of the olympics

7536121 in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests
7536122 this campaign is not about barack obama and hillary clinton
7536123 his campaign is about george bush and four more years of george bush under john mccain
7536124 that message is going to echo clearly from this platform

7536126 the republican track record on national security has not been particularly good
7536127 my job in this campaign is to explain that talking tough and acting dumb is not a way to keep you safe and secure

7536131 there is something more than just the reduction in driving that has to be brought in as an explanation for the huge drop in fatalities
7536132 its really very interesting that with all these efforts that have gone into building safer highways safer cars better enforcement this really dramatic change were seeing is due to economics to the price of gasoline
7536133 this is really the first time since the 1970s that people are thinking about driving and about what is the cost of an individual trip

7536141 surrounded by thriving hindu bohra and european merchants the agiarys parsi patrons wanted to show they were prosperous too
7536142 the agiaries represent a layer of the city that spans architectural styles over almost 300 years the oldest the banaji limji also in fort was consecrated in 1709
7536143 there were very few parsi merchants then and those who lived here needed shelter in case trouble broke out
7536144 it was a given that they would rush to the fortress like banaji limji with their families in such circumstances

7536180 freddy hurt his groin in the first 10 minutes we kept him on hoping it would get better but it didnt keiren has concussion and a dislocated thumb after the collision for the first goal which we felt was a free kick
7536181 i dont know whether steven wright will be ready for newcastle or doncaster so well probably have to go in with aron at right back again
7536182 thats not ideal you can get away with it once perhaps twice but you cant keep getting away with it and we missed him in the middle of the pitch
7536183 you want your best players fit on the pitch in their right positions so we might have to move for another right back possibly on loan

7536187 en la corte suprema de justicia estamos preocupados no s lo por la retardaci n de justicia sino tambi n por los obst culos que en materia civil tiene la poblaci n para acceder a la justicia porque los procesos son demasiado onerosos
7536188 los procesos civiles siguen siendo escritos lentos y exageradamente formalistas los jueces civiles practican diligencias que deben ser reordenadas y hasta suprimidas debido a su inutilidad o tiempo que consume a los despachos judiciales produciendo una aguda congesti n
7536189 es una alianza pol tica y militar de car cter ideol gico que conspira contra la libertad de comercio el ejercicio de las libertades individuales y la libre determinaci n
7536190 con los estados unidos no hemos tenido nosotros ning n tipo de esa informaci n que si un pa s hace una asociaci n con otro ellos van a tomar represalias
7536191 el alba es un proyecto social de solidaridad entre pa ses de am rica que buscan solucionar de manera unida los problemas que padecemos estas comunidades
7536192 tienen que respetar nuestra libertad de asociaci n nuestra libertad de integrarnos con centroam rica de integrarnos con latinoam rica y de poder salir adelante
7536193 este gobierno se ha definido como un proyecto basado en la doctrina del liberalismo social y adicionalmente hemos dicho que ideol gicamente estamos ubicados en el centro izquierda
7536194 me enter por una amiga que trabajaba como enfermera auxiliar en el hospital fernando v lez paiz que una se ora de nombre ofelia estaba regalando a una ni a
7536195 cuando me la dieron estaba desnutrida ten a gusanillos en la boca y ven a con una imagen religiosa que seg n su madre la iba a proteger
7536196 la ni a se puso rebelde y comenz a preguntar por la se ora que la engendr pero la verdad no s mucho de ella tal vez alguien sepa de la historia y a trav s de el nuevo diario la reconozca en las fotos y puedan reencontrarse
7536197 para m ella es mi hija mi esposo que en paz descanse tambi n la quiso como si fuera de su propia sangre siempre estudi en buenos colegios no le falt nada hoy quiero ayudarla a encontrar a su madre biol gica
7536198 ella tuvo temor de que me la quitara a pesar de que legalmente est inscrita como mi hija la mujer no volvi a aparecer pero eso lo supe hasta hace poco
7536199 el reparto adiact representa para las autoridades policiales uno de los principales focos de violencia y comercializaci n de drogas es por eso que decidimos intercambiar juguetes educativos por juguetes b licos a los ni os de escasos recursos econ micos

7536201 imprimiremos una visi n de desarrollo empresarial de defensa de los derechos y deberes de las mujeres y la elaboraci n de una agenda que recoja las necesidades sociales pol ticas econ micas y culturales de las f minas en cada municipio
7536202 no hay que ser paternalista porque eso hace da o
7536203 el trabajo cooperativo es importante porque se labora de mejor manera y eficacia
7536204 nuestros artesanos vender n sus productos con m s calidad y mejor precio iguales oportunidades tendr n productores de frijol que cultivar n m s reas con la oportunidad del financiamiento
7536205 se trata de fortalecer las cooperativas y darles valor agregado a los productos lo m s interesante no es s lo la articulaci n con instituciones no gubernamentales sino que hay participaci n ciudadana masiva
7536206 debemos formar grupos de hombres y mujeres que trabajen sus fincas y mercadeen sus productos con valor agregado sin intermediarios y con canales directos de comercializaci n para obtener mayores ganancias y mejorar el nivel de vida
7536207 son recursos que escasamente vienen a estos territorios y hay que lograrlos se formar n ocho cooperativas la mayor a integradas por mujeres en una red o una central de asociaciones para impulsar procesos productivos a trav s de toda la cadena lo que produzcan ser comercializado por ellas mismas
7536208 contrataremos abogados para la constituci n de las cooperativas y luego facilitaremos el financiamiento los gobiernos locales acompa ar n las fases del proyecto que tambi n ser apoyado por instituciones gubernamentales y gremios entre otros
7536209 si esto no fuese as si los partidos nacionales resolvieran nuestros problemas entonces por qu los indicadores de desarrollo y educaci n est n m s deprimidos que en otras partes del pa s
7536210 puede haber una alianza de c pulas pero la base sigue siendo yatama sigue siendo antisandinista y no comprende lo que sucede arriba porque no ha sido parte del proceso
7536211 nuestra nica debilidad es la falta de dinero esto hace que compitamos en desventaja con el plc el fsln y yatama que tiene el apoyo del gobierno porque nosotros despertamos simpat as en las minas pero no se nos ve viables por la falta de recursos
7536212 hay mucha inconformidad por un pacto a expensa de las bases y por eso vemos a yatama no sandinista a yatama sandinista a yatama de la resistencia y eso s lo divide y al final de cuentas el electorado yatama podr a terminar yendo hacia otra opci n
7536213 esto vendr a a dar mayor participaci n porque habr a influencia de la poblaci n en cuanto a que se ponga los mejores candidatos los l deres son de la regi n y pueden ser presionados por nosotros

7536218 con esta amenaza est diciendo que est listo para salirse de la oea
7536219 yo le quiero decir al secretario de la oea nuestro amigo jos miguel insulza con todo respeto que el proceso electoral en nicaragua lo decidimos los nicarag enses y si eso nos tiene que llevar a retirarnos de ese instrumento del imperio y de la oligarqu a pues primero nos retiraremos
7536220 los procesos internos de los pa ses est n interrelacionados y eso nos obligan a un mejor comportamiento
7536221 parece que esa es una idea que tiene entre ceja y ceja pensando que puede ir acompa ado por otros pa ses
7536222 was a record itself and is likely to be surpassed
7536223 todos esos factores combinados hacen que el sector aunque todav a sigue creciendo en el a o se est reduciendo dr sticamente
7536224 lo que queremos plantear es que el sector est reduci ndose y estos impactos se ven claramente por el cierre de varias empresas principalmente las del grupo taiwan s nien hsing
7536225 a diferencia de otras empresas del sector industrial que pueden trasladar una parte del costo al precio nosotros no podemos hacerlo en lo m s m nimo porque el valor de nuestro producto en el mercado internacional ya est dado y porque la alta competencia que hay en estados unidos con otros pa ses que son estructuralmente m s fuertes que nosotros hacen que nuestros precios no sean movibles e inclusive han bajado
7536226 se est n ajustando primero para ver c mo absorben esa reducci n de precios en el mercado y segundo para ver c mo recuperan esa baja en el precio produciendo m s
7536227 en eso se ve el claro ejemplo de c mo la crisis que est n enfrentando las empresas es una afectaci n de precios del producto en el mercado internacional
7536228 tienen que pasar por un proceso de reacomodo ajustes y capacitaci n de personal adem s de buscar clientes a quienes venderle
7536229 en el momento en que las empresas pierdan competitividad y no puedan vender en el mercado reducen sus precios de exportaci n se reducen sus ingresos por exportar es obvio que no podemos tener capacidad de seguir absorbiendo costos
7536230 la verdad es que estoy saliendo con muchas emociones contrarias
7536231 creo que ustedes no entienden qu belleza y qu riqueza tienen yo veo el potencial de nicaragua no es un pa s pobre es sumamente rico pero lo que ustedes tienen es un pa s donde la mayor a vive en pobreza por distintas razones adem s la brecha social la inequidad para m es intolerable que hay gente que vive all arriba que tiene lujos que casi yo no he visto en europa mientras otros viven en la pobreza absoluta extrema
7536232 hay que apurar eso y mejorar las condiciones para todos
7536233 es cierto que he recibido cr ticas de algunos o varios pol ticos diputados o gobierno y por supuesto que me hace sentir triste y tambi n las acusaciones de injerencia pero al mismo tiempo creo que cada uno tenemos una misi n y hay que ser leal a esta misi n
7536234 mi misi n aqu es defender los valores del gobierno de suecia en cuanto a democracia derechos humanos los derechos de la mujer de la ni ez y contra los fen menos de la corrupci n
7536235 para ser leal a sus principios y valores uno tiene que estar dispuesto a recibir cr ticas tambi n porque la persona que no recibe cr ticas de nada tal vez no ha hecho nada y es muy dif cil complacer a todo el mundo
7536236 s s s eso te queda bien tienes toda la raz n
7536237 todo mundo nos daba las gracias yo s que es gracias a su trabajo nosotros ponemos la plata pero el esfuerzo de estas personas es mejorar su vida
7536238 eso de ver estas mujeres yo he salido a visitarlas y me cuentan c mo esto ha mejorado sus vidas
7536239 yo lo vi en la cara no hab a duda es una mujer muy fuerte que conf a en su valor estaba produciendo en mejores condiciones para su familia y creo que para m es lo esencial
7536240 do a eva eres tan bonita que no te vas
7536241 muy sinceras y yo siento que es demasiado para m
7536242 por supuesto que se ha mejorado en mucho sentido pero tambi n hay casos que no vemos y creo que sigue siendo un problema serio para nicaragua
7536243 tambi n es importante lo que se ha mencionado tantas veces de los fondos de la cooperaci n que vienen de tantos pa ses nosotros los que estamos aqu ha sido importante plegarnos a las instrucciones de canalizar nuestros fondos a trav s de la cuenta unica de hacienda para el control y nos ha costado mucho la burocracia a veces tener la aprobaci n de la asamblea pero lo que quiero ver tambi n son los fondos de venezuela los que llegar n de ir n de otros pa ses tambi n hay que canalizarlos para tener recursos muy transparentes

7536446 la uf es un agente inflacionario que repite que en el mes que viene la inflaci n del mes que pas tambi n es injusta puesto que asegura reajustabilidad nicamente a los ricos que depositan dineros en los bancos en lugar de destinar esos recursos a las inversiones que el pa s requiere para su ajuste no es l gico otorgar reajuste autom tico a los ricos y negarlos a los pobres que ganan un salario
7536447 evidentemente creo que es necesario terminar con la uf ya que es un agente inflacionario que repite que en el mes que viene la inflaci n del mes que pas
7536448 fue inventada en el gobierno de frei montalva pero nicamente para inversiones de largo plazo luego se generaliz en el gobierno militar para toda la econom a cuando chile sufri la crisis de la d cada de 1980 se encontraban indexados no s lo los dep sitos en dineros sino que tambi n los sueldos posteriormente y para permitir el ajuste requerido para superar la crisis s lo se desindexaron los salarios as el ajuste fue pagado por los m s pobres si las cosas siguen como van y la inflaci n y el tipo de cambio suben se volver a repetir el mismo cuadro anterior
7536449 la situaci n actual es delicada y amenaza crisis hace m s de 3 a os que vengo anticipando lo que hoy es reconocido por todos la inflaci n se mantuvo baja mientras ca a el tipo de cambio a causa del alto valor del cobre lo que necesariamente provoc un enriquecimiento temporal del pa s pero este decaer al ajustar el tipo de cambio a una realidad estable gener ndose desocupaci n creciente es evidente que las empresas no pueden prosperar con un tipo de cambio artificialmente bajo no se han tomado todas las medidas necesarias para reducir la tasa inflacionaria y aumentar el crecimiento se debe actuar con urgencia por sobre el alto precio de la energ a que impide agregar valor a nuestras materias primas
7536450 hice mi servicio militar en la escuela militar lo mejor que pude y obtuve la primera antig edad alcanzando el grado de brigadier mayor hice mi servicio civil lo mejor que pude obteniendo en dos meses y luego de un infarto provocado por la arbitrariedad del r gimen militar que me conmin a retirar mi candidatura porque tem a que restara votos a la del candidato oficialista m s de 1 mill n de votos luego como senador fui electo con la primera mayor a porcentual de chile es decir ya aport mi grano de arena
7536451 ahora he vuelto a lo que me gusta es decir a crear empresas y crear trabajo y ese es mi actual trabajo
7536452 se han restado indispensables atribuciones que debe tener el parlamento en una democracia hoy se destacan all s lo los que hace show y no los que aportan con su inteligencia y capacidad en el quehacer legislativo
7536453 se ha privilegiado depositar los excedentes del pa s en el exterior sin considerar que el d lar ya no es una moneda dura y que su devaluaci n en los ltimos meses ha significado que chile haya perdido con tales pol ticas seg n mis c lculos m s de us 5 000 millones es decir el valor de varios transantiago ninguna de estas medidas que menciono a t tulo de ejemplos significa inflaci n pues el dinero queda fuera del pa s y el capital expresado en conocimiento y bienes dentro de chile
7536454 la energ a cara condena a nuestra juventud a ser recolectora de esas materias y por lo tanto a recibir salarios menores situaci n que ya advert siendo senador y presidente de la comisi n de econom a del senado el acaparamiento de aguas por endesa que se hizo due a del 87 de los derechos del pa s deriv en la situaci n actual una ley mal hecha durante el gobierno militar que fija el valor de la energ a no en base a oferta y demanda real actual sino que en base a valores esperados no incentiva la creaci n de nuevas fuentes de energ a porque los productores son pocos y est n concentrados por lo tanto jam s aumentar la producci n si con ello se les reduce el precio por el contrario demorar n las inversiones porque as gozar n hoy del alto precio que tendr a la energ a ma ana pero que se les paga ahora es decir los incentivos al igual que en el caso del transantiago est n mal puestos
7536455 acu rdese de los problemas que me cre endesa despu s de ofrecerme dinero para que como senador les apoyara y como ante mi rotunda negativa buscaron mi desafuero juicios todos que gan pues as ser m s f cil entender como los poderosos defienden sus posiciones de privilegio aunque sea a costa del pa s es sorprendente observar ahora que lo que advert en el a o 2000 el tiempo lamentablemente vino a confirmar
7536456 el costo de la energ a se ha cuadruplicado al no haberse tomado oportunamente medidas olvidando el gobierno que el estado tiene un rol subsidiario que cumplir en una econom a de mercado lo que tampoco se ha hecho pues los actuales gobernantes que antes abominaban del liberalismo al estudiarlo se enamoraron de l pero no saben aplicarlo ni saben sentirlo que es requisito indispensable para administrar una econom a de mercado
7536457 cuando los particulares no cumplen o no pueden cumplir su rol debe necesariamente el estado en una econom a libre cumplir el suyo que es subsidiario ello no sucede en chile en que en asuntos relevantes se observa un estado ausente que es la ant tesis de un liberalismo progresista en el cual yo creo el gobierno aplica un liberalismo decimon nico
7536458 ahora inventan historias truculentas para continuar dilatando creyendo que los vascos no somos tenaces defensores de lo que creemos justo es as como formamos nuestro pa s junto con los castellanos y as defendimos tambi n la pen nsula ib rica de la invasi n extranjera que logr someter a su gente durante 8 siglos sin nunca lograr vencer al pueblo vasco somos feroces defensores de lo que creemos justo y humildemente reconocemos nuestros errores cuando nos equivocamos como ocurre con todos quienes no nos creemos due os de la verdad pero tampoco del error y por el contrario con la verdad ajena enriquecemos la propia

7536462 attempt by organized labor to alter the workplace radically by seeking union recognition outside the long protected secret ballot election
7536463 rather than hold an election union representatives would need only to coerce a majority of employees to sign authorization cards once a union collects enough signed cards the organizing drive would be over and the business would become unionized all of this would occur either without the knowledge or involvement of the business owner

7536487 ever since bram cohen invented bittorrent web traffic has never been the same
7536488 whether thats a good thing or a bad thing however is a matter of debate
7536489 while initially used to share pirated material the system is now used by nbc bbc and others to deliver legal video content and by hollywood studios to distribute movies online experts estimate that peer to peer systems generate 50 to 80 percent of all internet traffic most predict that number will keep going up
7536490 ease this tension researchers at the university of washington and yale university propose a neighborly approach to file swapping sharing preferentially with nearby computers
7536491 this would allow peer to peer traffic to continue growing without clogging up the internets major arteries and could provide a basis for the future of peer to peer systems
7536492 the technology has the potential to lower bandwidth costs for isps and speed up downloads for p4p enabled filesharing clients

7536499 our goal is to provide families a musical outlet in an environment where their kids will be valued challenged and encouraged and come away with a love of music
7536500 they used basic lessons to teach them the elements of music and they experienced music in a way that helped them really appreciate it the instructors expectations were high but achievable so the kids had a real sense of accomplishment
7536501 we took him to piano lessons but he just went because we took him he never really showed interest until vivo he was excited to go interested in his homework and he really wanted to do well
7536502 part of the challenge is to come up with new and different methods of presenting information
7536503 there are a number of social emotional and physical challenges with any student so you have to tailor your classroom for the student

7536561 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7536562 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7536563 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7536564 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7536565 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7536566 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7536567 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community

7536572 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week

7536583 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7536584 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7536585 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7536586 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7536587 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7536588 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7536589 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7536590 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7536591 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7536592 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7536593 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7536594 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7536595 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7536596 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7536597 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7536598 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7536599 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7536600 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7536601 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7536602 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7536603 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7536604 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7536605 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7536606 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7536607 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7536608 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7536609 you know how many fastballs up in the zone he threw a lot
7536610 but he strikes a lot of guys out its power stuff the first three innings he threw like one breaking ball all of his fastballs were up in the zone and he was getting guys to chase them
7536611 i want to be a two dimensional fly ball pitcher with the ability to get a ground ball when i need to
7536612 say i walk a guy if im a fly ball pitcher i need three fly ball outs but with a ground ball you can get two outs on one pitch so its something ive been working on
7536613 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7536614 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7536615 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7536616 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7536617 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7536618 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7536619 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7536620 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7536621 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7536622 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7536623 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7536624 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7536625 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7536626 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7536627 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7536628 that puts him in a terrible bind because you cant give a ringing endorsement when youre talking about foreign policy
7536629 obviously the hard thing to talk about with obama is commander in chief of all his many talents
7536630 you dont rah rah about commander in chief you rah rah about hope and change and a new party and all that so no matter what he does somebody will find fault with it
7536631 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7536632 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7536633 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7536634 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7536635 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7536636 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7536637 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7536638 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7536639 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7536640 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7536641 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7536642 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7536643 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7536644 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7536645 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7536646 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7536647 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7536648 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7536649 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7536650 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7536651 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7536652 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7536653 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7536654 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7536655 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7536656 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities

7536661 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7536662 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7536663 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7536664 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7536665 i have to put everything on the table i dont think its a good alternative but if they can prove that it is and they want to pay royalties to the taxpayer let us use those royalties to invest in renewable energy resources then we have something to talk about
7536666 oh were going to have elections were going to have them by october theyre going to be inclusive theyre going to be transparent theyre going to be fair and this or that

7536757 its always nice to win in front of the owner of the club
7536758 it does help and im sure he enjoyed it i think winning just helps settle everyone down ive been trying to accentuate the positives for a while but not many people have been paying attention theyre more concerned with negative accounts of what is happening

7536775 we are very excited about moving forward into this important 28 day study with rvx 208 our previous clinical study demonstrated that rvx 208 was safe tolerable and had favourable pharmacokinetics

7536777 the ensuing phase 1b 2a study comprises several novel facets to expedite the clinical process for rvx 208 and its eventual registration as a drug
7536778 along with the required regulatory provisions that must be addressed such as safety tolerance and pharmacokinetics the study also will measure key reverse cholesterol transport markers which rvx 208 impacts these are exclusive favourable features that make this drug unique among its competitors
7536779 inventories continue to remain high which means we are in a buyers market

7536811 i am prepared to take all that responsibility for the good of the team i still back the players do they suddenly become bad players or is there something else wrong
7536812 we should have won the opportunities were there but we just let them slip im not going to panic because having watched the video again i saw how great we played its just that final thing we are missing either a pass not going to hand or someone having the wrong body position and losing the ball in contact or not working hard enough in support
7536813 decision making in split seconds is new to the guys and it has been a bit worrying the onus is now on the player but they want to be in a confined group where they are comfortable but im trying to say to them that even if they make a mistake i still think they are the best in the country
7536814 we should pursue negotiations and working groups on russias wto accession but we will inform our partners of the need to exit some agreements which currently oppose the interests of the russian federation

7536842 there are nearly 1 2 million people living with parkinsons in europe and with an ageing population this figure is set to rise its time to address inequalities in care and treatment of the disease and improve the lives of those affected by parkinsons now and in the future
7536843 some parts of the country have better services than others but the realities of the difficulties facing those with parkinsons on a daily basis suggests that more and better services and greater access to those services is needed along with a greater public awareness of what parkinsons is
7536844 this is a terrible condition and we must heighten the publics awareness of it to ensure the fight for improved care and treatment continues throughout europe

7536860 in order to unit test your program use a functional programming language
7536861 anyone who has tried to test a sufficiently complex class will find that the amount of work to set up the internal state of an object to test a single use case for a method prevents even the most keen programmer from doing so
7536862 maybe i am stupid but i see only one use case for a test that is to ensure that your application is running as expected on other machines as well i dont believe that anyone who does intensive testing wasnt a professional coder who has to use tests anyway for various reasons
7536863 how can i test this method its untestable too hard to test

7536870 by the way to the guys praising groovy groovy sucks it is the java attempt to keep people in java
7536871 jruby not in its setting or configuring jirb under windows
7536872 using c is like shooting yourself in the foot with a machine gun
7536873 since the precise order of execution is not guaranteed the bits of computing specified by the programmer in an fp can be optimized in other ways too for example if the vm sees that a given instructions in the code is not dependent on the outcome of the previous instruction it can execute them both simultaneously if there are more than one cores available

7536880 japanese fans have a committed love of reggae dancehall music making this opportunity more than worthwhile
7536881 as this is our first time in japan the experience has been quite rewarding

7536895 the results showed a clear link between outlook and risk of breast cancer with optimists 25 percent less likely to have developed the disease conversely women who suffered two or more traumatic events had a 62 percent greater risk
7536896 young women who have been exposed to a number of negative life events should be considered an at risk group for breast cancer and should be treated accordingly
7536897 the mechanism in which the central nervous hormonal and immune systems interact and how behavior and external events modulate these three systems is not fully understood

7536950 i liked hillary i saw what she went through with the republicans and she didnt cave in
7536951 but i am not about to vote republican because she isnt the nominee

7537010 the fact that hillary is still on the ballot does not indicate unity and could very well indicate a serious division in the party going into the stretch lets revisit this unity issue next week sometime when all of the polls are in
7537011 suddenly hillary clinton is more popular in the republican party than the democratic party john mccain wants her so bad he can taste it
7537012 no clinton no vote for the jerk cnn made famous president john mccain sounds great about now
7537013 she will release her delegates before roll call vote to save her some major embarassment dont blame her shes playing it right democrats have to get it together or well be known as the party of egotists come on democrats lets be adults and do what is best for our country
7537014 i am disappointed senator clinton will release her delegates im not about to sign on for obama i will not vote for mccain but if he wins he will be saddled by a heavily democrat house and senate thats good enough for me until 2012 and clinton runs again
7537015 no matter how much the media wants to push us to unite there are some of us who refuse to support the candidate they shoved at us www mccain08clinton12 com
7537016 by choosing biden as his running mate obama literally ignored the 17 or so million voters who cast their vote for hillary and this is only on his way to the nomination how many more people is he willing to ignore and overlook should he become president
7537017 i personally believe obama has already promised hillary the first opening on the supreme court which is fine by me but she needs to campaign vigorously not only for obama but against bush mccain well all be able to judge hillarys true character after the next two months
7537018 speakers will seek to validate obama and create the image of a leader capable beyond his years
7537019 give me a break obama at 47 is older than teddy roosevelt john kennedy and bill clinton were when each of them was sworn in as president why not do conscientious voters a favor and start contrasting obama and mccain on issues rather than on age
7537020 i cannot believe that these supporters of mrs clintons are so childish that they do not understand that their support for mccain will be give america four more years of the same neo con republicans government and thus they will be voting against the interest of their country
7537021 the real enemy of the american people is the so called news media they were so busy trying to make obama look good that they ignored the republican party assuming that they couldnt possibly win no matter who they were up against i just love seeing an arrogant plan go awry
7537022 i see that contrary to the assertions by some that democrats will suffer in november the polls show the vast majority still think that republicans have led this country in the wrong direction on both foreign and domestic policy issues republicans are expected to lose a lot more than just the white house

7537041 we wanted to know whether a drug specific for ppar delta would have the same beneficial effects
7537042 genetic engineering in humans commonly known as gene doping when mentioned in connection with athletic performance is certainly feasible but very impractical
7537043 we got the expected benefits in lowering fatty acids and blood glucose levels but no effect absolutely none on exercise performance
7537044 that led us to consider whether ampk activation was the critical trigger that allowed ppar delta to work
7537045 it essentially puts a turbo charge on ppar delta which explains why exercise is so important
7537046 thats as much improvement as we get with regular exercise
7537047 while calorie restriction diets are followed as a matter of course in communities like okinawa the diet can be difficult to follow for most people our discovery indicates that by following a calorie restriction diet for six months and then taking alpha lipoic acid while eating normally the same life extension effects will be experienced
7537048 simply adding the supplement to the diet has no effect it seems that alpha lipoic acid fools the body into behaving as if it was still on whatever diet it was following before the supplement was added we found there was an anti obesity effect as well although weight does rise when you come off the restricted diet if you take alpha lipoic acid even though you are eating normally again you still have a reduced weight
7537049 if you put the animals on to a restricted diet they would normally go on to an extended survival trajectory when they were switched to a normal diet this compound seemed to lock them into the benefits of their pre existing diet
7537050 it is an unusual and interesting finding and it needs repeating in further research that was as far as i was prepared to go but malcolm goyns wanted to apply it to humans i said i didnt agree with his interpretation and we had to wait for further studies
7537051 people have been buying this stuff and taking it for years as a dietary supplement i dont think anyone knows what its effect is there have only been two studies in rats and mice before our study
7537052 it is also sometimes used in stroke patients to treat re perfusion injury what happens as the blood supply is restored after a stroke is oxidative damage to the cells alpha lipoic acid is an antioxidant and can help reduce the damage it is also used to treat diabetics and oxidative damage to the liver in people who have eaten poisoned mushrooms

7537069 when the crews dropped him off he was in a stable but critical condition
7537070 when crews arrived they found an 18 month old boy who had suffered a very serious head injury they were told that it had been caused by an air gun
7537071 crews immediately started treating the child and very quickly took him to birmingham childrens hospital travelling on blue lights
7537072 two additional paramedics travelled with the ambulance crew to provide additional assistance on route to hospital
7537073 shortly after arrival he was described as critical but stable but we have had no further update since that time
7537074 i know this is a subject of police interest already and we will know more as time goes on
7537075 i can confirm that we are still treating him i am not at liberty to confirm anything else if there are criminal matters pending that makes it even more difficult for us
7537076 an 18 month old boy is in a critical condition in hospital with a serious head injury after what appears to be a tragic accident yesterday afternoon at the youngsters home in birmingham
7537077 the toddler was playing with other young children in the garden of his home in the washwood heath area when he sustained a pellet wound to the back of the head from an air weapon
7537078 a strong line of inquiry is that young children aged under five somehow managed to access the air weapon and accidentally caused it to go off
7537079 while we are still trying to establish precisely what happened this does appear to be a tragic accident involving young children

7537089 while these versions did protect against the vulnerabilities discussed in the bulletin they lacked other important security and reliability updates
7537090 this only affected the packages on the microsoft download center microsoft update and office update contained and were distributing the correct versions of the binaries and did not need to be updated

7537092 the best thing i ever discovered in my relationship was that she his girlfriend will never be perfect

7537097 i did talk to him on the phone a short while ago and told him that he is in everyones thoughts and prayers
7537098 it was obviously the news that i did not want to hear

7537100 the only thing i talked with michael about was his new challenge moving forward in his new assignment and he was very excited about that

7537103 i havent talked to any of the players or to kiwi or anyone this afternoon and until i do that i will just refrain from any thoughts about what might happen within our team
7537104 i think its the number one thing that brings frustration anxiety and knots in your stomach all the things that go along with the injury to the players which do not allow your team to function as it is presented on paper
7537105 those types of things are very difficult for coaches no matter what age you are

7537121 he needs to introduce himself to voters who know him by name but not by substance
7537122 the results showed a clear link between outlook and risk of breast cancer with optimists 25 percent less likely to have developed the disease conversely women who suffered two or more traumatic events had a 62 percent greater risk
7537123 young women who have been exposed to a number of negative life events should be considered an at risk group for breast cancer and should be treated accordingly
7537124 the mechanism in which the central nervous hormonal and immune systems interact and how behavior and external events modulate these three systems is not fully understood
7537125 the relationship between happiness and health should be examined in future studies and relevant preventative initiatives should be developed
7537126 when a patient is in crisis or in pain every minute is an eternity and if theyre at home the agitation and anxiety is horrific if you have no idea where to go
7537127 when my husband had terminal lung cancer i kept him at home because im an lpn but even though i had worked in hospitals and rehab for nearly 20 years it was completely different i used vitas and it was such a relief to be able to pick up the phone and call if its a crisis no matter how minor its very comforting to be able to give the patient relief and to know theres someone to turn to who can make the patient comfortable or decide to send the patient to the hospice or hospital
7537128 knowing theres a call center relieves caregivers and gives them confidence
7537129 having staff available at night eases anxiety and decreases emergency department visits
7537130 we can get up to 200 calls at the telecare call center per night
7537131 the triage nurses can handle most calls by phone but if not the nurse prioritizes them and dispatches an rn or lpn runner priority one is basically emergent care and symptom management for pain breathing difficulties fall with trauma alzheimers sun downing and any abnormal activity or something we cant handle over the phone priority two includes dressing changes medication teaching and other things that arent critical priority three is something such as reordering supplies
7537132 theyre dispatched by priority and regional area so the closest nurse can get there fastest usually within a half hour for priority one calls
7537133 we can admit patients during the night whenever patients and families prefer
7537134 it may be because of agitation pain difficulty breathing caregiver distress or if the patient is dying and they dont want the death to occur at home especially if children are present
7537135 nurses can provide round the clock care to enable patients to remain at home go out to stabilize the patient as much as possible and make patients and families as comfortable emotionally and medically as they can
7537136 were there for families afterwards through contact calls support groups and cards
7537137 i swear to allah that i do not know them they were strangers
7537138 one of the womens names was maybe fadhila and the other was called widad
7537139 no no they put it on me and told me to take it off at home
7537140 i did not disconnect it because maybe it fell off me
7537141 we moeten wel de realiteit onder ogen blijven zien ik denk dat iedereen het rekensommetje wel kan maken resultaten zoals vorig kwartaal kunnen we niet te lang volhouden we hebben wel iets langer dan een paar kwartalen maar daar wil ik het niet op aan laten komen
7537142 the results showed a clear link between outlook and risk of breast cancer with optimists 25 percent less likely to have developed the disease conversely women who suffered two or more traumatic events had a 62 percent greater risk
7537143 young women who have been exposed to a number of negative life events should be considered an at risk group for breast cancer and should be treated accordingly

7537145 the relationship between happiness and health should be examined in future studies and relevant preventative initiatives should be developed
7537146 women are included in the populations studied now but the study designs often are not focused specifically on gender differences
7537147 create as large a repository as possible of real time metrics data from windows pcs all over the world whos running what and how its performing
7537148 the study monitors only a very small sample from an unknown number of sources
7537149 these users are not necessarily representative of windows vista users as a whole
7537150 per our longstanding practice allowing downgrade rights enterprise customers and purchasers of windows vista ultimate or windows vista business editions can choose to downgrade to windows xp professional if they feel they need more time to get ready for windows vista
7537151 may downgrade in the short term but with an eye toward upgrading later
7537152 we found that 65 percent of the boxes pre loaded with vista were still running it and the rest were running windows xp
7537153 either manually wiped the drive and installed xp or paid the vendor to uninstall vista and install xp it blows you away that people will pay not to have the default operating system
7537154 getting metrics about your pc is not the kind of thing grandma would want to do
7537155 contrary to the recent devil mountain software survey windows vista momentum is getting stronger and stronger
7537156 the great thing is that nobody can lie about our numbers
7537157 the machines automatically report what theyre running and how burdened they are
7537158 we were arrested and taken to a university for questioning w

7537163 explained dr eric nestler scientific co founder and chairman of psychogenics
7537164 there was a mirror beneath a little desk and it was all broken and i used my foot to push it away from the desk

7537217 some of our managers are worried that russian capital will buy up everything we wont allow that
7537218 the danger is not in russian capital but in domestic bureaucracy

7537222 we have been made aware of a security breach at the offices of an external contractor involving the loss of personal information about offenders in england and wales
7537223 a full investigation is being conducted police and the information commissioner have been informed
7537224 the data was held in a secure format on the contractors site it was downloaded onto a memory stick for processing purposes which has since been lost the transfer of data on this assignment to the external contractor has been suspended
7537225 we are collaborating closely with the home office on this matter we have no further comment to make at this time
7537226 it is deeply worrying that after a number of major data losses and the publication of two government reports on high profile breaches of the data protection act more personal information has been reported lost
7537227 the data loss by a home office contractor demonstrates that personal information can be a toxic liability if it is not handled properly and reinforces the need for data protection to be taken seriously at all levels it is vital that sensitive information such as prisoner records is held securely at all times

7537677 theorists often speculate why open source and free software project contributors give theirwork away although contributors make their work publicly available they do not forfeit their rights to it community managed software projects protect their work by using several legal and normative tactics which should not be conflated with a disregard for or neglect of intellectual property rights these tactics allow a projects intellectual property to be publicly and freely available and yet governable exploration of this seemingly contradictory state may provide new insight into governance models for the management of digital intellectual property
7537678 the types of threats that they defend against differ from the threats typically targeted with these legal techniques first i explicate attributes that open source software shares with public good and common pool resource models next i discuss the research methods and mechanisms used to protect six community managed software projects analysis of these mechanisms motivates a discussion of the practices used to manage common pool resources a conceptualization of open source software that more explicitly recognizes its collective governance is advanced i conclude by exploring ways in which this conception might challenge existing assumptions about the nature of community managed software and inform future research

7537946 albeit these people have clearly stolen intellectual property i think there are better ways of resolving this within our power as developers and publishers
7537947 other than to build game experiences that make it more difficult for there to be any value in pirating games
7537948 to consolidate the processes now in effect to strengthen the re foundation of the government states and the construction of pluri national states and pluri cultural societies via constituent assemblies with direct representation of the indigenous pueblos and nations
7537949 decisions are not taken in mobilizations but in governments states we must keep in mind that we have to build a different kind of power an alternative power to confront the crisis in our countries linking up with unions social movements teachers students the church will help us to build an all inclusive political movement
7537950 participation in politics and becoming authorities is a must the people must become the government and perform well indigenous people are suffering but so are poor people in the cities we must unite with them against the yankee military political and economic apparatus and the transnationals
7537951 f or an indigenous summit the declaration is perhaps notable for its lack of explicit ethnic discourse instead it spoke of struggles against neoliberalism and for food sovereignty on one hand this pointed to the indigenous movements alignment with broader popular struggles in the americas on the other it demonstrated a maturation of indigenous ideologies that permeate throughout the human experience political and economic rights were focused through a lens of indigenous identity with a focus on concrete and pragmatic actions for example in justifying the declarations condemnation of the construction of a wall on the united states mexico border tonatierras tupac enrique acosta declared that nowhere in the americas could indigenous peoples be considered immigrants because colonial borders were imposed from the outside
7537952 the iii continental summit of indigenous nations and pueblos of abya yala marks a new phase in the relationship between the nations of indigenous peoples and the government states of the americas one of the most telling examples of this fact is the presence of the minister of foreign relations for the bolivian government mr david choquehuanca who on monday addressed the inaugural session of the summit abya yala in representation of president evo morales of bolivia president morales himself is scheduled to arrive at the summit abya yala on friday to attend the official closure of the five day gathering

7537959 sue is one of my dearest friends and when we found out she had lung cancer we were so upset
7537960 she has already fought breast cancer and got over that so to have this again is awful
7537961 she is such a friendly and bubbly person and when she said she would lose all her hair i thought i would do it too
7537962 we had a lot of hair between us but we werent nervous about it one or two may have had some worries but when it is such an important cause something like shaving your head doesnt seem a big deal

7538022 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas
7538023 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
7538024 hemos debido salir varias veces de nuestras casas junto a nuestras familias y ni os ya que en los allanamientos la polic a act a violentamente y nos golpean injustificadamente sin respetar a nadie
7538025 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
7538026 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
7538027 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
7538028 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

7538034 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7538035 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7538036 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo

7538041 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7538042 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7538043 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7538044 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7538045 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7538046 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural

7538051 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
7538052 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
7538053 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
7538054 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo

7538059 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7538060 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7538061 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7538062 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7538063 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7538064 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7538065 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
7538066 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
7538067 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
7538068 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica

7538297 he had brass knuckles in his right pocket that were reported missing from the a amp e store
7538298 it took 24 hours to get this case finished but it was worth every minute of it to clear these crimes
7538299 in general camp is tedious and some of the stuff is irrelevant at times its just a long overdrawn out process i personally think that you can still get the same work without doing as much banging but since i got here late for this camp i cant really judge how they do it here since coming in its been a matter of me learning the playbook and the nuances of the defense i came here raw so im playing catch up
7538300 absolutely your starting quarterback has to be ready for the first regular season game
7538301 with the guys that have played as long as he has played you are not quite as concerned about their minutes in the preseason now i want him hasselbeck to feel better thats my main concern but as far as not playing or not getting enough reps i dont worry about that too much
7538302 we were arrested and taken to a university for questioning we were held for nearly 24 hours without any sleep and were interrogated for up to about eight hours
7538303 the guys i was with were given the reason that it was illegal to undertake even a peaceful protest and to talk about the situation in tibet
7538304 they seemed to have decided to really clamp down on protesters
7538305 ive sent a letter to mamata banerjee asking her to end the protests and i hope we will be able to resolve the issue through talks
7538306 our door is open for discussion but the government must return the land
7538307 if he hasnt played in the preseason it would be hard to start him
7538308 teman apa yang terjadi kenapa banyak teman kita yang hilang dan kenapa kamu terlihat sedih
7538309 teman teman kita telah dibunuh oleh orang yang membawa gergaji
7538310 orang orang berdatangan ke hutan ini dan menebang setengah dari teman teman kita dan membawa mereka pergi
7538311 jadi maksudmu teman teman kita telah dibunuh oleh para manusia

7538315 la gente pensa che la vita sia una strada dritta ma sbaglia la vita un circolo un maledetto cerchio che gira in tondo alla fine ti ritrovi in mano esattamente quello che avevi allinizio e finisci per tornare al luogo da cui sei venuto
7538316 mi rimasto cos poco a cui aggrapparmi e non voglio che mi venga tolto
7538317 ti sbagli la realt ce li strappa a uno a uno

7538322 prima di te bella la mia vita era una notte senza luna molto buia ma con qualche stella punti di luce e razionalit poi hai attraversato il cielo come una meteora allimprovviso tutto ha preso fuoco cera luce cera bellezza quando sei sparita la meteora scomparsa dietro lorizzonte e il buio tornato non era cambiato nulla ma i miei occhi erano rimasti accecati non vedevo pi le stelle niente aveva pi senso
7538323 we think we can prevent a problem that could have as much impact as the s amp l crisis
7538324 the fbi correctly diagnosed that mortgage fraud was epidemic but it did not come close to meeting its announced goal
7538325 it used everyday procedures and woefully inadequate resources to deal with an epidemic
7538326 the approach was certain to bring symbolic prosecutions and strategic defeat
7538327 we were dealing with the issue as best we could back then
7538328 cosa devo fare per convincerti non stai dormendo e non sei nemmeno morta sono qui e ti amo ti ho amata
7538329 amo la cosa bella che a noi ci pu cadere pure il mondo addosso che non sar mai una grave perdita perch noi non siamo sole io ho te e tu hai me e sar al tuo fianco sempre qualsiasi decisione prenderai

7538332 lo so bella credimi lo so come se ti fossi portata via met di me stesso
7538333 isabella swan prometto di amarti per sempre ogni singolo giorno per leternit mi vuoi sposare
7538334 eri come un sole il mio sole personale il rimedio migliore alle nuvole
7538335 ceux qui limaginaient repartir sur les chapeaux de roue se trompaient d clare lun de ses proches elle avait besoin dun long repos et surtout de calme avec ses deux enfants
7538336 it was very intimate and both guy and madonna made vows to each other and pledged to try to make their marriage strong again the ceremony lasted about an hour they turned up at the kabbalah centre in their gym clothes and changed into white robes everyone at the centre hopes that they will get through their recent rough patch
7538337 ti criticheranno sempre parlertanno male di te e sar cos difficile incontrare qualcuno al quale tu possa andare bene cos come sei anche se io so che esiste
7538338 se fossi capace di sognare sognerei te e non me ne vergogno
7538339 prima di te bella la mia vita era una notte senza luna molto buia ma con qualche stella punti di luce e razionalit poi hai attraversato il cielo come una meteora allimprovviso tutto ha preso fuoco cera luce cera bellezza quando sei sparita la meteora scomparsa dietro l orizzonte e il buio tornato non era cambiato nulla ma i miei occhi erano rimasti accecati non vedevo pi le stelle niente aveva pi senso
7538340 i expressed this wish he the owner of the car agreed
7538341 amd is executing a strategic plan to transform the company becoming leaner and more focused while seeking to create a business model to deliver sustainable profitability
7538342 will become the core of broadcoms dtv line of business
7538343 there is an agreement between the two sides that there will be no foreign soldiers in iraq after 2011
7538344 there is a provision that says the withdrawal could be done even before 2011 or extended beyond 2011 depending on the security situation
7538345 the neck is fine and 100 but he has lost a lot of weight
7538346 we will take some guidance from the player himself on whether hes mentally ready but i think hes been in the game long enough to know he would only go out there if he was confident he could be an effective player i have a lot of faith in richard to make the right decision
7538347 motus a bit of a struggle at the moment hes got a recurrence of his knee injury
7538348 its going to be tough for motu to get onto the training park this week
7538349 we will make a decision on adam later in the week he has played only in fits and starts which has been the case for him all year
7538350 the disadvantage of that is that we have nothing to go off of
7538351 but the advantage is that we really get to set the direction for agriculture in ghazni province
7538352 the commanders on the ground want as many of these teams as they can get
7538353 they see the good in what the teams can do long term to turn the tide and create stability in the farming regions
7538354 there has been some but not enough to meet the needs of afghanistan revitalizing agriculture is one of the key priorities for our government to the extent that we get technical assistance in military form or civilian form it helps us a great deal
7538355 ive been an infantry officer my entire career 25 years
7538356 this is very different i always thought my command would be in a combat mission but this is a good mission you really get to see the effects youre having
7538357 the challenges weve had getting states on board is because the guard is so busy with missions throughout the theater
7538358 we compete with resources with the entire national guard but having said that the local farm boys of the army guard have come out of the woodwork
7538359 it looks like barren wasteland until you drop water on it
7538360 i dont know what kind of magic stuff is in the soil
7538361 we have not seen any in ghazni but if we did we would not do anything about it thats another units job
7538362 whatever they can sell their harvest for at that time is what they get the rest of it goes to waste they have no means to store it or preserve it
7538363 whatever they can capture and collect at their spot is what they have available water management is the largest issue and it cannot be resolved in one year it will be handed off to future teams
7538364 just in the small amount of time our boys have been on the ground theyve gone after some quick hit infrastructure support projects to start making a turn for the local farmers
7538365 we need technical expertise to use in that secure environment
7538366 thats part of an effective counterinsurgency strategy if we dont help the people with their livelihoods and create jobs it will be really hard to win their hearts and minds

7538383 ich bin supergl cklich das war keine leichte zeit aber ich habe halt nicht gedopt
7538384 das verfahren zieht sich mit sicherheit noch ein paar monate hin sollte ich wirklich gesperrt werden hoffe ich dass ich eine m gliche reststrafe im sommer absitzen kann
7538385 wir sind froh dass polaczek die vorbereitungsspiele mitmachen und kann und zum saisonstart dabei ist er ist f r uns eine wichtige person und er hat darunter sehr gelitten
7538386 es ging uns darum schaden f r das deutsche eishockey die spieler den deb und die del abzuwenden und zu versuchen den richtigen weg zu finden
7538387 die problematik ist gro und juristisch hochbrisant die sperren sind ausgesetzt bis zur entscheidung in der hauptsache der vergleich ist im wesentlichen darin begr ndet dass es formfehler gab
7538388 sekarang sariputta sotapanna sotapanna dikatakan apakah yang dimaksudkan dengan sotapanna ini
7538389 para bhikkhu ketika hubungan dengan orang orang yang bijak terjadi mendengarkan dhamma yang sejati pun terjadi
7538390 sungguh sulit untuk dapat mendengarkan dhamma yang sejati begitu pula sungguh sulit munculnya seorang buddha
7538391 di depan dan dari mulut bhagava sendiri saya mendengar dan menerima pernyataan
7538392 di tempat tertentu ada sangha dengan seorang thera pemimpin kelompok tersebut
7538393 di tempat tertentu ada banyak bhikkhu thera yang telah banyak belajar mahir dalam doktrin dapat menghapal dhamma dan vinaya di luar kepala
7538394 di tempat tertentu ada seorang bhikkhu thera yang telah banyak belajar mahir dalam doktrin dapat menghapal dhamma dan vinaya di luar kepala
7538395 bila hal hal ini menuju pada nafsu bukan pada tanpa nafsu pada kemelekatan bukan pada tanpa kemelekatan pada pengumpulan bukan pada pelepasan pada ketenaran diri bukan pada kerendahan hati pada ketidakpuasan bukan pada kepuasan pada keramaian bukan pada ketenangan kesendirian pada kemalasan bukan pada usaha pada hal hal yang merumitkan bukan pada kesederhanaan tentang hal hal ini engkau bisa merasa pasti ini bukanlah dhamma ini bukanlah vinaya ini bukanlah ajaran sang guru
7538396 tetapi bila hal hal ini menuju pada tanpa nafsu bukan pada nafsu pada tanpa kemelekatan bukan pada kemelekatan pada pelepasan bukan pada pengumpulan pada kerendahan hati bukan pada ketenaran diri pada kepuasan bukan pada ketidakpuasan pada ketenangan kesendirian bukan pada keramaian pada usaha bukan pada kemalasan pada kesederhanaan bukan pada hal hal yang merumitkan tentang hal hal ini engkau bisa merasa pasti ini adalah dhamma ini adalah vinaya ini adalah ajaran sang guru
7538397 kassapa dhamma yang sejati tidak akan lenyap selama dhamma yang palsu belum muncul di dunia tetapi ketika dhamma yang palsu telah muncul di dunia dhamma yang sejati akan lenyap
7538398 para bhikkhu saya tidak mengetahui satu hal lainnya yang dapat dicela sedemikian besarnya selain pandangan salah pandangan salah para bhikkhu adalah sangat tercela
7538399 dan apa para bhikkhu yang disebut dengan pandangan benar pengetahuan tentang penderitaan pengetahuan tentang penyebab timbulnya penderitaan pengetahuan tentang lenyapnya penderitaan dan pengetahuan tentang jalan menuju lenyapnya penderitaan inilah yang disebut sebagai pandangan benar
7538400 demikianlah caranya dia memperhatikan dengan tidak bijaksana apakah aku ada di masa lampau
7538401 ketika dia memperhatikan dengan tidak bijaksana dengan cara ini salah satu dari enam pandangan pun muncul di dalam dirinya
7538402 yang mulia kepribadian kepribadian dikatakan apakah yang disebut kepribadian oleh bhagava
7538403 sahabat visakha lima kelompok kehidupan yang dipengaruhi oleh keterikatan inilah yang disebut kepribadian oleh bhagava yaitu tubuh jasmani perasaan persepsi kehendak dan kesadaran yang dipengaruhi oleh keterikatan lima kelompok kehidupan yang dipengaruhi oleh keterikatan inilah yang disebut kepribadian oleh bhagava
7538404 yang mulia bagaimana asal mula terjadinya pandangan tentang kepribadian itu
7538405 di sini sahabat visakha seorang biasa yang tidak jeli menganggap lima kelompok tersebut sebagai pribadi atau merupakan milik pribadi atau bersemayam berada di dalam pribadi atau pribadi tersebut bersemayam berada di dalam lima kelompok begitulah asal mula terjadinya pandangan tentang kepribadian
7538406 di sini sahabat visakha seorang ariya yang jeli tidak menganggap lima kelompok tersebut sebagai pribadi atau merupakan milik pribadi atau bersemayam berada di dalam pribadi atau pribadi tersebut bersemayam berada di dalam lima kelompok begitulah bagaimana pandangan tentang kepribadian tidak terjadi
7538407 bhagava apa penyebabnya apa alasannya sehingga keraguan tidak muncul di diri seorang ariya tentang hal hal yang tidak dinyatakan
7538408 karena siswa ariya tersebut telah mematahkan berbagai pandangan bhikkhu pandangan pandangan tersebut adalah apakah tathagata ada setelah parinibbana apakah tathagata tidak ada setelah parinibbana apakah tathagata ada dan tidak ada setelah parinibbana dan apakah tathagata bukan ada dan bukan tidak ada setelah parinibbana siswa ariya tersebut memahami pandangan asal mula pandangan berhentinya pandangan serta jalan menuju lenyapnya pandangan 12 sehingga pandangan pandangan yang tidak dinyatakan di atas dengan sendirinya juga tidak akan dinyatakan olehnya
7538409 sahabat yamaka seorang bhikkhu arahat dengan noda yang telah sepenuhnya ditinggalkan apa yang terjadi kepadanya pada saat hancurnya tubuh ini atau setelah meninggal apabila ditanyai sedemikian rupa bagaimana anda akan menjawabnya
7538410 apabila saya ditanyai sedemikian rupa sahabat saya akan menjawab seperti ini sahabat tubuh jasmani adalah tidak kekal apa yang tidak kekal merupakan penderitaan apa yang merupakan penderitaan telah berhenti dan padam perasaan persepsi kehendak kesadaran adalah tidak kekal apa yang tidak kekal merupakan penderitaan apa yang merupakan penderitaan telah berhenti dan lenyap tanpa sisa dengan cara demikianlah saya akan menjawabnya
7538411 bhagava telah sepenuhnya tercerahkan dhamma telah dibabarkan dengan baik oleh bhagava sangha sedang mempraktekkan jalan yang baik
7538412 para bhikkhu bila keyakinan seseorang telah ditanam berakar dan mantap di dalam tathagata melalui alasan alasan istilah istilah dan frasa frasa ini dikatakan bahwa keyakinannya sudah ditopang oleh alasan berakar di dalam visi dan mantap keyakinannya tak terkalahkan oleh petapa atau brahmana atau dewa atau mara atau brahma atau siapapun di dunia ini
7538413 para bhikkhu mereka yang memiliki keyakinan yang tak tergoyahkan kepada tathagata semuanya adalah para sotapanna dari para sotapanna ini lima kelompok di sini di alam manusia lima kelompok lainnya memenangkan tujuannya setelah meninggalkan tempat ini dan mereka yang telah memutus lingkaran kelahiran mereka yang memiliki keyakinan yang tak tergoyahkan kepada tathagata semuanya adalah para sotapanna
7538414 seorang siswa ariya berdiam di rumah dengan pikiran yang bersih dari noda kekikiran bermurah hati dengan tangan terbuka suka menolong bergembira dalam berdana orang yang senang beramal senang berdana dan berbagi
7538415 seorang siswa ariya memiliki kebijaksanaan yang melihat ke dalam muncul dan lenyapnya fenomena yang mulia dan menembus dan menuju pada musnahnya penderitaan secara total
7538416 para bhikkhu lebih dari seratus lima puluh peraturan latihan yang harus diucap ulang setiap dua minggu yang dilatih oleh para pria muda yang menginginkan tujuan
7538417 dan bagaimana pandangan yang ariya dan membebaskan ini membawa orang yang mempraktekkan sesuai dengannya menuju hancurnya penderitaan sepenuhnya
7538418 di sini seorang bhikkhu pergi ke hutan akar pohon atau ke gubuk yang kosong mempertimbangkan demikian adakah obsesi yang belum kutinggalkan yang mungkin mengobsesi pikiranku sehingga aku tidak dapat mengetahui atau melihat segala sesuatu sebagaimana adanya jika seorang bhikkhu terobsesi oleh nafsu indera maka pikirannya terobsesi jika seorang bhikkhu terobsesi oleh niat jahat maka pikirannya terobsesi jika seorang bhikkhu terobsesi oleh kemalasan dan kelambanan maka pikirannya terobsesi jika seorang bhikkhu terobsesi oleh kegelisahan dan kekhawatiran maka pikirannya terobsesi jika seorang bhikkhu terobsesi oleh keraguan maka pikirannya terobsesi jika seorang bhikkhu terjerat di dalam spekulasi tentang dunia ini maka pikirannya terobsesi jika seorang bhikkhu terjerat di dalam spekulasi tentang dunia lain maka pikirannya terobsesi jika seorang bhikkhu suka bertengkar dan bercekcok dan terbenam di dalam perselisihan saling menikam dengan belati ucapan maka pikirannya terobsesi
7538419 tidak ada obsesi yang belum kutinggalkan yang mungkin mengobsesi pikiranku sehingga aku tidak dapat mengetahui atau melihat segala sesuatu sebagaimana adanya pikiranku sudah disiapkan dengan baik untuk terjaga bagi kebenaran kebenaran ini pengetahuan pertama yang dicapai oleh dia yang ariya di atas duniawi dan tidak dimiliki oleh orang biasa
7538420 bila aku mengejar mengembangkan dan membina pandangan ini maka aku memperoleh ketenangan internal aku secara pribadi memperoleh keheningan inilah pengetahuan kedua yang dicapai oleh dia yang ariya di atas duniawi dan tidak dimiliki oleh orang biasa
7538421 tidak ada petapa atau brahmana lain di luar ajaran buddha yang memiliki pandangan seperti yang kumiliki inilah pengetahuan ketiga yang dicapai oleh dia yang ariya di atas duniawi dan tidak dimiliki oleh orang biasa
7538422 aku memiliki karakter manusia yang memiliki pandangan benar inilah pengetahuan keempat yang dicapai oleh dia yang ariya di atas duniawi dan tidak dimiliki oleh orang biasa
7538423 aku memiliki karakter manusia yang memiliki pandangan benar inilah pengetahuan kelima yang dicapai oleh dia yang ariya di atas duniawi dan tidak dimiliki oleh orang biasa
7538424 aku memiliki kekuatan manusia yang memiliki pandangan benar inilah pengetahuan keenam yang dicapai oleh dia yang ariya di atas duniawi dan tidak dimiliki oleh orang biasa
7538425 aku memiliki kekuatan manusia yang memiliki pandangan benar inilah pengetahuan ketujuh yang dicapai oleh dia yang ariya di atas duniawi dan tidak dimiliki oleh orang biasa
7538426 ada yang lebih baik daripada kekuasaan mutlak atas bumi daripada pergi ke surga atau daripada memerintah seluruh dunia yakni pencapaian tingkat kesucian sotapanna
7538427 jangan langsung diterima jangan langsung ditolak teliti oleh dirimu sendiri benar tidaknya
7538428 siapalah orang ini yang menganggap dirinya mengerti dan berceramah di depan orang
7538429 selama dhamma dan vinaya ditaati dengan baik maka dunia ini tidak akan kekosongan arahat
7538430 si a pasti seorang arahat si b punya kekuatan sakti dsbnya sehingga kita mungkin melalaikan praktek sendiri
7538431 russias historic role of the guarantor of piece in the caucasus has increased
7538432 the caucasus has always been and will remain the zone of russias strategic interests
7538433 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will be part of the georgian state
7538434 i read the other day that canada throwed that guy out
7538435 good for them the day jimmy carter became president he welcomed all the draft dodgers home i didnt like that oh no i had no time for him after that
7538436 what they should have done is extradited him directly to the u s because hes being deported hes still free
7538437 its way past time for this guy to face the music
7538438 canada was wrong to rule against jeremy and his family all they seek is to live in peace
7538439 i think he should lose a lot of privileges that red blooded americans have
7538440 he shouldnt be able to hold any state or federal jobs
7538441 ive had the opportunity to speak out against the war no offense to the soldiers over there i have respect for them as soldiers but it was a bogus war based on false pretenses and im happy to have not taken part in it
7538442 they should round him up and have him executed all deserters should be executed on the spot in times of war deserters should be executed
7538443 ill tell them i went through basic training served in the 82nd for three years also i applied for conscientious objectors status and was denied i tried to work within the provisions of the army just because youre a soldier doesnt mean you abdicate your responsibility to be a moral being
7538444 ill end up with whatever they want to give me
7538445 he knew what he was getting into i just thought it was wrong
7538446 maybe if he had a chance and fulfilled his obligation if thats even possible
7538447 then you wonder if he had the kids to avoid going to jail but still
7538448 most of those guys got drafted in if they were a conscientious objector it wasnt their choice when you go to a recruiting station and sign a contract you need to honor the contract read the fine print no i do not have any compassion for this guy
7538449 i feel it is every persons duty to serve if theyre able to i felt like i had to do it as a citizen of the freest nation
7538450 theres no draft anymore he didnt get drafted into the army
7538451 he chose it as a career thats just like me choosing to come to certified brake no matter how tough it gets i have to stick with it these guys choose it for a career he turned his back on the united states the way i see it
7538452 they ought to give him a double dose because he volunteered for it
7538453 i hope there are lots of people in fayetteville even though they feel differently about the war than he does who would be able to respect the kind of integrity and courage he has shown
7538454 if you are going to be retrospective it has to be immediately useful
7538455 any information about the future what went wrong in the beginning and how we can fix it im open ears
7538456 who he was still alive no kidding hows liu xiangs ankle
7538457 chairman who the only chinese leader to qualify as an answer in a pub quiz
7538458 more a figure who was there when chinese politics pivoted than himself being a pivotal figure
7538459 an obscure functionary who briefly served as the handpicked successor to ccp chairman mao zedong
7538460 huas account of his mandate from mao looked extremely shaky there was logic behind his elevation
7538461 these findings indicate that we can use this functional biomarker with confidence to determine stable warfarin doses for patients which should lower the risks of adverse drug effects across ethnic populations
7538462 african americans are known to need a higher dose of warfarin and asians and caucasians need lower doses
7538463 now we have a basis for understanding why this is the case
7538464 this study highlights the importance of identifying genetic biomarkers that reflect a marker genes variability and the molecular mechanisms that underlie that genes activity
7538465 you can more effectively manage healthcare costs and stay healthy at the same time by taking control in other ways
7538466 these are always good ideas not just when money is tight
7538467 lifestyle changes can be very economical and save the individual and system money
7538468 and some folks especially seniors are known to ration their medications because of financial hardship by taking a daily medication every other day to make it last longer
7538469 i would suspect that this is even more the case with milk at 5 a gallon and gas at 4 a gallon
7538470 encourage your doctor to take care of several related issues at the same time

7538472 with one in six people now affected by a neurologic disorder theres tremendous demand for the latest information on how to best meet the needs of this fast growing population of patients and caregivers neurology now books will fulfill this growing demand
7538473 with the experience the academy has had in publishing neurology now magazine its sought to advance patient care and has developed an appreciation for the needs and concerns of neurology patients and caregivers neurology now books will continue to further our mission of improving patient care and public understanding of disorders of the brain and nervous system
7538474 bleeding complications are reduced by 70 percent when interventional cardiologists go in through a radial artery in the wrist
7538475 but our research shows that only a tiny fraction of stenting procedures are done this way the study suggests that maybe its time to change the way we practice
7538476 the findings are somewhat surprising given that numerous studies have shown that r pci is similarly successful to f pci and that r pci can significantly lower risk of bleeding especially among women patients younger than 75 and people undergoing pci for acute coronary syndrome
7538477 based on these results we recommend that new clinical trials in this patient population include testing for wt1 mutations to confirm their prognostic importance and ultimately to develop therapies that target this gene
7538478 this finding was totally unexpected and it suggests that the wt1 gene could be one of the strongest prognostic markers in aml patients with normal chromosomes
7538479 it predicts a higher risk of relapse and death even when other molecular markers or clinical variables are considered
7538480 it is important that people with epilepsy and their caregivers take steps to prevent these tragedies
7538481 people with active epilepsy should shower instead of bathe take medication regularly to control seizures and should have direct supervision when swimming
7538482 the radical behavioral change that is needed to reduce hiv transmission requires radical commitment
7538483 prevention strategies will never work if they are not implemented completely with appropriate resources and benchmarks and with a view toward sustainability the fundamentals of hiv prevention need to be agreed upon funded implemented measured and achieved that presently is not the case
7538484 nothing should be more important than a major focus on young people not only in sub saharan africa but in many other parts of the world as well
7538485 patients managed medically without stenting or bypass surgery tend to be elderly and frail and in some sense we feel they have been overlooked
7538486 we wanted to find out what clinical factors were funneling them into a medicine only group and what happened to them when compared to patients who received stents and bypass procedures
7538487 it is important to know that the patients in the medically managed group had a higher death rate despite receiving most of the currently recommended medications for this condition from clinical practice guidelines
7538488 there are often very good reasons why stenting or bypass are not viable options for some patients what this study tells us is that for these patients who are medically managed we need to come up with better treatment approaches that lessen their risk of death
7538489 the study suggests that the critical ingredient in smoking that may be causing emphysema is cadmium a well known contaminant of cigarette smoke
7538490 the worry is if you are exposed to this cadmium through other sources you can also be at risk for emphysema
7538491 the big picture is we keep learning more about the contributions of environmental toxins to the chronic diseases of aging for which we never suspected an environmental cause
7538492 with a larger population we will be able to better disentangle the independent effects of cadmium and smoking and whether dietary cadmium or other non cigarette sources may also influence lung function
7538493 there are very few drugs with strong evidence of effectiveness in treating trigeminal neuralgia
7538494 if people fail to respond to these drugs physicians should not be reluctant to consider referring the patient for surgery often surgery is considered a last resort and patients suffer while the well intentioned physician tries other medications with limited effectiveness
7538495 if patients dont respond well to carbamazepine or one or two other drugs it is reasonable to consider surgery that targets the root of the trigeminal nerve
7538496 people with trigeminal neuralgia should be aware of the availability of surgical treatments and discuss these options with their physicians

7538506 was of the belief that these sexual interactions would be a positive experience for her daughter and that richards would receive sexual gratification

7538510 we are soldiers still a journey back to the battlefields of vietnam
7538511 the last book didnt finish the story and we thought especially after our trip back to the battlefield there was another story of interest to tell and so we decided to tell it
7538512 its a different book its not just a continuation of the war its post war
7538513 general an sat with general moore on the bus and they talked about their careers for having been worlds apart were remarkably similar
7538514 i had called everyone all together on the field and we formed a circle
7538515 we had our arms around each other and we had a moment of silence for the soldiers who died on both sides and when that circle broke up general an walked over to me and stuck out his hand and we shook hands and very surprising he reached over and kissed me on both cheeks it was totally an unexpected event
7538516 i had a compulsion to go back there in peacetime and walk that ground on which i lost so many men and on which the first major battle of the vietnam war was fought
7538517 and i had a compulsion to not only walk the battlefield in the daytime but to spend the night there and read the feelings that came into my head during the night
7538518 do you hate someone forever when the war is over the battle happened 43 years ago you cant live on hate and what we found is that the veterans of a war even from opposing sides have more in common than any veteran has with any civilian whos never known war
7538519 orangina is a drink which is mainly aimed at children and young people but this new advert places the product in a very sexualised and provocative context
7538520 the almost sinister portrayal of animals in an animation style filled with sexual innuendo leads to very mixed and confused messages
7538521 its outrageous my concern is the ethical standards and moral values of an education system that believes it has the right without my permission to get my daughter to put condoms on plastic penises

7538601 if only i could see the results that these people are getting in the testimonials
7538602 the end game for the gse situation could be quite a long time in coming
7538603 in our view it is highly unlikely that either fannie mae or freddie macs capital will fall below critical levels by the end of the third quarter so a conservatorship nationalization will likely not occur in the near term
7538604 we believe a capital infusion from the treasury is possible but we view it as also unlikely unless losses in the third quarter go far beyond our worst estimates
7538605 while imminent action is certainly possible it is not clear to us that the treasury is in any rush to act
7538606 ultimately it appears as though treasury action will only be forced if a debt auction freezes up as long as investors keep buying the debt the stock price is irrelevant
7538607 likelihood of a quarter percentage point rate hike increased following yesterdays stronger than expected gdp figures for the second quarter
7538608 the main points of contention are proposed cuts in next years budget particularly concerning the defense and health and welfare budgets

7538687 now i say unto you that ye must repent and be born again for the spirit saith if ye are not born again ye cannot inherit the kingdom of heaven therefore come and be baptized unto repentance that ye may be washed from your sins that ye may have faith on the lamb of god who taketh away the sins of the world who is mighty to save and to cleanse from all unrighteousness
7538688 has water in itself any virtue to wash away sin certainly not but the lord says if the sinner will repent of his sins and go down into the waters of baptism and there be buried in the likeness of being put into the earth and buried and again be delivered from the water in the likeness of being born if in the sincerity of his heart he will do this his sins shall be washed away will the water of itself wash them away no but keeping the commandments p 72 of god will cleanse away the stain of sin

7538705 the mpc cannot ignore the fact that recession threats have worsened while the near term rise in inflation is unavoidable it is also temporary as weaker growth would clearly push down inflation sharply next year limiting the threat of a major recession must be the priority
7538706 the mpc continues to be pulled in opposing directions by rising inflation and slowing growth however the balance of risk appears to be shifting more rapidly a cut in interest rates may be needed sooner rather than later to prevent the economy from drifting towards recession

7538709 we used to have this thing about stress being bad but what we call eustress literally meaning good stress has positive benefits it comes from doing things like exercise sex or meeting a challenge physically it improves your respiration lowers blood pressure and heart rate and your levels of endorphins hormones which make you feel good are raised

7538715 roxies way of coping is to go out and surround herself with friends sams is to stay at home
7538716 everyone says how terrible it must be for roxie losing her twin but its just as hard for sam who was also very close to jodie
7538717 at sport and riding she always showed determination and a lack of fear
7538718 she applied those same qualities to coping with her illness she never complained never said why me nor did she show any jealousy of roxie being able to have a normal life michelle and rob had no idea jodies would die so soon after the above picture was taken having an identical twin it was in her face the whole time that roxie had everything but she was only bad tempered a few times when the chemo made her feel awful
7538719 so i took her to the doctor who referred her for an mri scan
7538720 it was wonderful that rob rox and sam were able to visit clic allowed us to stay together
7538721 in the easter holidays jo began getting terrible back pain a scan revealed that the cancer had returned grown and contaminated some lymph nodes on april 29 we were told that she could have more chemotherapy to prolong her life but the cancer was terminal we chose not to tell jo because we didnt want to take away all hope
7538722 we thought jo had an inkling because the pain was returning
7538723 it was a terrible shock to us to find out how much of a shock it was to her that was one of the few times she cried she wasnt afraid of death she thought you became a star but she didnt want to leave her friends
7538724 she decided who to leave which piece of jewellery to and wrote lovely letters to her friends telling them individually that they had been the best friends anyone could want she asked them to keep smiling and said she would be watching them
7538725 she also planned her own memorial service which we held at newton abbot racecourse where jodie had always been good at picking winners no flowers because she wanted the money donated to clic everyone was to come in bright colours she wanted to celebrate the wonderful life she had had her message was that everyone should make the most of theirs
7538726 early that afternoon we played ordinary people by john legend one of the songs she had chosen for her memorial service when it was finished she asked rob and i to hold her up and sam and roxie to hold her hands then she just passed away it couldnt have been more peaceful

7538731 rise to the challenge of defining themselves as an ethical nation
7538732 you may appear nice but we know there are sleeper cells of americans
7538733 please suggest any comprehensive work of tafseer quranic commentary for us muslim youth
7538734 islam wishes to destroy all states and governments anywhere on the face of the earth which are opposed to the ideology and programme of islam regardless of the country or the nation which rules it the purpose of islam is to set up a state on the basis of its own ideology and programme regardless of which nation assumes the role of the standard bearer of islam or the rule of which nation is undermined in the process of the establishment of an ideological islamic state it must be evident to you from this discussion that the objective of islamic jihad is to eliminate the rule of an un islamic system and establish in its stead an islamic system of state rule islam does not intend to confine this revolution to a single state or a few countries the aim of islam is to bring about a universal revolution
7538735 islamic jihad does not recognize their right to administer state affairs according to a system which in the view of islam is evil furthermore islamic jihad also refuses to admit their right to continue with such practices under an islamic government which fatally affect the public interest from the viewpoint of islam
7538736 these kinds of statements are really irresponsible because they can lead to violence against ordinary people i dont see any difference between that and al qaeda and osama bin laden using islamic theology to justify violence against americans whats interesting is if you compare their statements about what islam is and what muslims believe youll find they are almost identical and i reject both interpretations both the non muslims who are saying that islam justifies violence against christians and jews and the muslims who are saying it certainly these statements have a very unnerving effect especially when they continue when more than one person says it
7538737 as a practicing muslim i believe that there is a core of fundamental beliefs and practices that distinguish authentic islam from deviations
7538738 im convinced that it is not only inaccurate but unhelpful if our major concern is security security of this country this is a term that has very bad resonance in the muslim majority world and makes us feel uncomfortable here
7538739 the products that are coming from the muslim world are not being called islamic products or islamic oil
7538740 i believe that many americans believe that muslim women dont have any rights in islam perhaps they see images of muslim women being oppressed in different parts of the muslim world and believe that that is because of their religion but in fact we know that muslim women have the same rights as muslim men and virtually all the same duties and obligations
7538741 one of the popular misconceptions about islam is that women are seen as lesser figures that they dont have rights
7538742 this perception that women in islam are oppressed is based both on misinformation as well as am amplification of certain unfortunate tendencies in some parts of the muslim world its true that people have seen some muslim authorities using islam as a justification for the oppression or suppression of women thats a reality we cant deny it but we have to balance those incidents with whats going on in the rest of the muslim world in which most women are participating in their societies weve seen that within recent times four muslim majority nations have had female heads of state in most countries that ive traveled to muslim women are involved in all aspects of society
7538743 mattson muslim women have the same legal rights as muslim men the prophet mohammeds wife was a businesswoman in fact he met her working for her as her agent the legal rights of women were enshrined in islamic law however cultural practices in many societies have prevented those rights from being enforced
7538744 that can be frustrating i want to also make sure people understand that although american muslims do have a responsibility to clarify their views on terrorism and violence done in the name of islam we dont have control over these situations we dont have some sort of magic power over all muslims in the world
7538745 right wing christians are very risky allies for american jews mattson said because they the christians are really anti semitic they do not like jews and enter into the alliance on the basis of fundamentalist beliefs that it would be desirable for all jews to return to israel she suggested that fundamentalist christians might turn against jews or that there could be backlash from ordinary americans against jewish and fundamentalist christian supporters of israel
7538746 the american government has not criticized sufficiently the brutality of the israeli government believing that it needs to be
7538747 thus it is not permitted for a muslim to maintain a close friendship with a highly intelligent person who engages him or her in stimulating conversation if that person continuously derides the sacred quran 5 57 58 indeed since preserving faith is the highest priority it is important that muslims avoid demoralizing dependence on other faith communities for their protection and material needs clearly there are groups among american christians and jews who are so hostile to muslims that we should not join with them even in shared concerns lest we lend any credibility to their organizations there are many other groups within those communities however who are eager to work respectfully with muslims to further just causes
7538748 we see candidates being asked to prove that they comply with an ever narrower definition of what it means to be a christian forget about being a muslim or a jew
7538749 provided opportunities for the extreme fundamentalist muslims to meet with their supporters

7538919 rural america is getting fleeced by the railroads one shipment at a time

7538921 americas farmers and ranchers deserve a fair competitive and transparent rail system

7539144 childhood is a crucial time when bodies are growing and brains are developing its so important to fuel the body with good nutrition and teaching children smart eating habits at a young age is a great idea it starts with the parents serving as the role model
7539145 when children consume a high fat high sugar meal their bodies will crash and they will become very tired and lethargic which is not going to help them perform at their best level in school

7539184 when the student to pc ratio moves from about 9 1 to 3 1 it makes sense to get the computers out of the labs and into the classrooms
7539185 and once there are enough computing stations in each classroom the teachers can personalize lesson plans be more productive and better engage their students
7539186 students are much more involved during class due to the increased personal attention they are receiving from teaching staff and are also highly receptive to the use of computers in the classroom setting

7539195 what a tremendous opportunity for students and for their potential and what a powerful advantage for canada

7539197 these initiatives will truly make a difference in the lives of our young people who are pursuing post secondary education
7539198 the most daunting challenge we face is related to finances
7539199 that is why programs that provide financial assistance for low income students are so important it opens up doors of opportunity that are otherwise closed to us

7539210 we have recently commenced proceedings against parties involved in the production and distribution of a movie entitled hari puttar
7539211 however it is our policy not to discuss publicly the details of any ongoing litigation
7539212 we registered the hari puttar title in 2005 and its unfortunate that warner has chosen to file a case so close to our films release
7539213 in my opinion i dont think our title has any similarity or links with harry potter
7539214 but the biggest concern for tim gullikson his coach was my attitude on the court i tended to slump and slouch especially when things werent going my way anyone can play tennis when hes firing on all cylinders the challenge is to play well enough to win when youre not at your best theres a sneering inner judge in all of us and a big part of being successful is tuning him out instead of listening to that judge when he says youre lousy or should pack it in because youre tired and theres always next week thats when you need to suck it up and act like a man hang on fight on show the pride of a champion
7539215 hang on fight on and show the pride of a champion

7539220 warner bros production and anticipated release of the watchmen motion picture violates 20th century foxs long standing motion picture rights in the watchmen sic property we will be asking the court to enforce foxs copyright interests in the watchmen sic and enjoin the release of the warner bros film and any related watchmen media that violate our copyright interests in that property

7539226 we have developed an extremely simple iphone application that allows us to display comics that have been specifically formatted for the iphone ipod touch
7539227 what were doing is creating new comics and adapting existing comics into a format that makes reading comic books an enjoyable and easy experience on these devices
7539228 creators and studios will be able to set the final prices on their titles but were expecting most standard length titles to be around 99 and were encouraging creators to give away the first issues of their titles to allow new readers who may not be familiar with comics but are iphone ipod touch owners to give comics on the devices a try
7539229 with digital comics on the iphone ipod touch we have access to a world wide audience no printing costs or print run minimums and it doesnt take 3 months to get the title from in the catalog to on sale in a store each title will be featured as its own application in the app store and will be backed up onto the readers desktop or notebook computer each time they sync their device

7539239 if oil revenues are going up 500 percent you can afford to pay your workers more but that will just add to the inflationary spiral

7539362 money plays a significant role in peoples lives and yet little experimental attention has been given to the psychological underpinnings of money we systematically varied whether and to what extent the concept of money was activated in participants minds using methods that minimized participants conscious awareness of the money cues on the one hand participants reminded of money were less helpful than were participants not reminded of money and they also preferred solitary activities and less physical intimacy on the other hand reminders of money prompted participants to work harder on challenging tasks and led to desires to take on more work as compared to participants not reminded of money in short even subtle reminders of money elicit big changes in human behavior
7539363 we are eager to explore the idea that money leads to a perspective on the world that emphasizes inputs and outputs with an expectation of equity cf

7539391 however we are mindful that the allegations made by police prosecution at this point in time are extremely serious
7539392 the accused person is actively trying to deceive police by inferring other people are involved in the matter and not being entirely honest

7539397 in july they said that the markets spirit would return when the olympics came what spirit is that now we are all dead and have no spirit left in the market
7539398 recent data suggested that the slowdown has taken a firmer hold of the economy and the olympics may present some downside risks
7539399 the deceleration in export growth was the main reason for the slowdown in industrial output
7539400 eight percent growth in china is equivalent to a recession below nine percent would make the authorities quite nervous
7539401 if growth goes lower than 8 the government will be very worried
7539402 concerns over chinas export health will translate into a complete reversal of the current tightening of policy
7539403 make its top macroeconomic priorities maintaining stable and relatively fast economic growth
7539404 external demand will continue to weaken and the negative impact on exports economic growth and employment will emerge further
7539405 place a higher priority on containing price rises and curbing inflation and implement a tight monetary policy
7539406 the top leadership is carefully considering an economic stimulus package
7539407 this will include tax cuts and measures to stabilize domestic capital markets and support healthy development of the housing market
7539408 targeted pro growth policies widely expected from the government in the second half will have a countervailing positive impact on fai
7539409 new policy measures to support growth could include further tax rebates for low end exporters an easing of lending quotas slower yuan appreciation or even depreciation
7539410 china is returning to the investment heavy growth model we saw in 2003 and 2004

7539412 i encountered many instances where i had reason to believe that i and other directors were being deceived on important issues by one or more levels of management
7539413 various forms of deception would come to the fore in the playing out of these structural tensions
7539414 by deception i mean something broader than deliberate lying although that can certainly occur
7539415 it can also involve the withholding of important relevant information or the cynical advocacy of the most self serving of a range of possible interpretations in other words spin
7539416 an enormous amount of publicity perhaps all of you will have heard or read something about this trial
7539417 only three weeks ago i had to discharge the jury because some of the jurors disobeyed my directions and misconducted themselves the court is anxious to ensure that every member of the jury that tries this case can be completely impartial
7539418 absolutely forbidden from making your own inquiries about this trial
7539419 these developments are placing severe pressure on australias competitive position in high performance sport
7539420 sport in this country is at the crossroads and the next few months provide the government with the opportunity to make its mark on the system and to leave a legacy of sporting success into the future
7539421 the single major change i believe that is needed is for the genuine amalgamation of the various programs and activities of the australian institute of sport and the state and territory institutes and academies of sport into one integrated system
7539422 this needs to be complemented by increased spending on talent identification sports science and sports medicine and support for coaches
7539423 we need to sharpen our funding focus on highly ranked athletes and sports at the expense of non performers and grants for national sporting organisations need to be increased and indexed
7539424 it will be an important issue for the review but so will be many other issues like how to get more young kids involved in organised sports and creating strong pathways from local junior sports into the more senior levels
7539425 are there areas of fragmentation i mean of course the federal government puts a lot of resources into sport but so do our state governments and then so do our sporting organisations are there ways that we can better co operate and make that money go further
7539426 the government will be long term funding partners with the aoc australian olympic committee with the australian institute of sport in the lead up to the london games and to the games beyond that as well
7539427 we compete well at olympics we believe in getting behind our athletes we do the right thing but at the same time we want to broaden out the community participation in sport as well

7539429 major issue still relates to recognition of the deteriorating patient
7539430 variation from expected standard of care which had significant contribution to death
7539431 which contains potentially preventable deaths is the greatest cause for concern and should be the highest priority in relation to ensuring recommendations are implemented
7539432 it was determined that aspects of the provision of health care may possibly have contributed to or exacerbated the patients outcome
7539433 communication delays in sharing clinical information and documentation were the most common causal factors

7539471 the results showed a clear link between outlook and risk of breast cancer with optimists 25 percent less likely to have developed the disease conversely women who suffered two or more traumatic events had a 62 percent greater risk
7539472 young women who have been exposed to a number of negative life events should be considered an at risk group for breast cancer and should be treated accordingly
7539473 the mechanism in which the central nervous hormonal and immune systems interact and how behavior and external events modulate these three systems is not fully understood

7539514 dyer actually i spent the past year doing a very high speed self education job on climate change and i think i probably talked to most of the senior people in the field in a dozen countries they are scared they are really frightened things are moving far faster than their models predicted i mean you may have the arctic ocean free of ice entirely in five years time in the late summer you know nobody thought that would happen until about the 2040s even a couple of years ago so there is this sense of things moving much faster the military are picking up on that and drawing their own scenarios and analyses and predictions up accordingly the train is leaving the station
7539515 in fact our research shows there are relatively few places on the planet where the us military isnt active in some way

7539522 with the success of searchmela for airfares we are thrilled to be able to offer the same tool for consumers looking for hotel rooms
7539523 unlike the air industry the hotel market is very fragmented and finding the right price in this era of soaring prices is even more important allowing consumers to compare hotel rates from whichever sites they choose will provide travelers with more quality hotel choices at better rates
7539524 sixty two percent of our business was lease and that business overnight has evaporated
7539525 weve really had to rethink what were doing and how were doing it
7539526 leasing has been their saviour for so long it gets that customer into a higher end vehicle which obviously has a fatter gross profit to it it keeps the customer tied to the dealership because they know at the end they have to return the car to them and typically it puts them in a shorter buying cycle
7539527 the farmer wants a wife phenomenon is very real in these places
7539528 years ago it was the case that a woman in those areas might have been married to the guy next door by the age they are 21 and having kids by the time theyre 23 but thats just not the case anymore
7539529 instead weve seen a generation thats very mobile that is interested in obtaining a tertiary education who want to live in the big cities travel and do all those things that were beyond the reach of their parents
7539530 ive been cooked and roasted and carved up i dont have a hair left on my body
7539531 i dont think barry realises how close he is coming to seriously getting the business community offside he is going to have some serious navel gazing to do if he plans to sell it off when he is premier but opposed it in 2008
7539532 i will listen to them the lobbyists as i have listened to others but ultimately as weve said all along were here to determine our position on this matter on whats best for the state
7539533 people are not knocking on the door looking to invest billions of dollars in nsw
7539534 certainly electricity is one of the key issues that has to be settled to unblock billions in investment thats why theyre beating a path to his mr ofarrells door saying well state a position
7539535 its now clear mr ofarrell can only be delaying for one of two reasons hes weak and directionless or hes playing politics
7539536 either way he has no excuse for failing to be honest with the people of nsw
7539537 im opposed to it and have been since the first mention of it
7539538 we love the park and we love trees but now some of the residents in new beach road have no sunlight
7539539 theres no doubt that these trees have completely blocked out peoples views of the harbour and even the harbour bridge we cant ignore this issue
7539540 i am not saying they should be pulled out but i think we should do further investigations into what extra pruning can be done so people can still have their views
7539541 the final result of removing the lower foliage and the uppermost foliage would severely disfigure the trees
7539542 if we remove these trees because they block views it sets a dangerous precedent
7539543 maybe we should have a development application process for trees
7539544 trees and views are an issue right across the municipality
7539545 i totally agree we should be preserving views and these trees were the wrong species from the start
7539546 an enormous amount of publicity perhaps all of you will have heard or read something about this trial
7539547 only three weeks ago i had to discharge the jury because some of the jurors disobeyed my directions and misconducted themselves the court is anxious to ensure that every member of the jury that tries this case can be completely impartial
7539548 absolutely forbidden from making your own inquiries about this trial

7539552 yes let me see on the one hand i could have had granite countertops and stainless steel everything and spanish tiles or on the other hand i can have a wife who cant tell the difference between an almond and her index finger hmmm let me think about that

7539561 for people with obesity and reflux together the gastric bypass procedure appears to be effective not only for weight loss but also for the control of reflux symptoms
7539562 because in this case most of the acid from the stomach is being partitioned away so it doesnt have exposure to the esophagus
7539563 however with gastric banding the problem is that you actually create a pocket which acid has the ability to fill from the remainder portion of the stomach
7539564 and this acid can just sit there above the band and make its way back up to the esophagus this can cause reflux disease to develop or make it worse than it had been if it was a problem before the procedure

7539703 our study shows that americans are better at saving money when they are thinking about it month to month on an ongoing basis rather than a long term goal

7539723 at this stage i was still a muslim and i thought that i would remain one but every day i saw the terrible things done in the name of religion by those who considered themselves great believers i studied islam more thoroughly and found no answers there i reexamined the koran and the principals of the faith and found how it is mistaken and misleading the muslims borrowed rituals and traditions from all the surrounding religions
7539724 i feel that christianity has several aspects its not only a religion but a faith
7539725 i now see god through jesus and can tell about him for days on end whereas the muslims wont be able to say anything about god i consider islam a big lie the people who supposedly represent the religion admired mohammed more than god killed innocent people in the name of islam beat their wives and dont have any idea what god is i have no doubt that theyll go to hell
7539726 there is only one way to paradise the way of jesus who sacrificed himself on the cross for all of us
7539727 i hope that hell understand this and that god will give him and my family the patience and willingness to open their eyes to jesus and to christianity
7539728 maybe one day ill be able to return to palestine and to ramallah together with jesus in the kingdom of god
7539729 im opposed to a policy of killing civilians or using them as a means to an end and i understand that israel has a right to defend itself

7539733 arguably as the bigger more cost efficient stores move out the poor increasingly are likely to find themselves choosing between traveling farther to purchase nutritious competitively priced groceries or paying inflated prices for low quality processed foods at corner stores
7539734 stores pricing and location decisions in most instances are guided by competitive factors rather than any bias against the poor or their neighborhoods
7539735 one suggestion would be to explore the possibility of encouraging co operative stores which spreads the ownership among a relatively large group of stake holders within the poor community while at the same time increasing its operational economies of scale another possibility might be to consider joint ownership or management of franchises of selective stores in the poorest neighborhoods by the corporate owners of big grocery chains and poor residents

7539737 what started as a chamber of commerce event to recognize orville redenbacher who developed his popcorn business in the city has turned into one of the top summer festivals in the state
7539738 this years is a significant milestone for this event and the vcfe board of directors felt it appropriate at this time to recall those many memories for current residents those who have moved away and return with happy thoughts about the events and for the many visitors who come from throughout the state the chicagoland area and across the country to participate in this event

7539851 we call on the government to introduce legislation to reduce the voting age to 16 and allow thousands more young people who want to exercise a right to vote to do so

7539855 i recently spent three hours on the streets of london talking to the public about this issue and i collected 90 postcards to send to gordon brown calling for a reduction in the voting age so im personally aware of growing support for votes at 16 amongst the general public

7539894 it is troubling we have young people that are dying and being murdered
7539895 the homicide bureau is up to the task of solving all of these but once again it doesnt bring the victims back
7539896 we cant deny weve got 19 homicides we dont have all the answers as to why
7539897 were growing as a community when these things happen we need to react and solve them
7539898 we dont know if theres an increase in crime unless weve looked at this over a period of time
7539899 i told him to leave i told him it was stupid dont go to the fight
7539900 were still asking those questions and its slowly being pieced together however we need to have all the information brought forward

7539904 if we call our case we lose that last kick at the cat opportunity as well
7539905 by not calling evidence the crown has to draw all the strings together and try and come up with a common thread and then we have an opportunity to hear the entirety of that argument before we make ours
7539906 in general theres a circumstantial body of evidence that the crown is going to rely on and suggest that it is sufficient to prove his involvement
7539907 obviously the man was kidnapped its a question of who did it or if you will what involvement they had
7539908 i might have something to say after the verdict but not now
7539909 our job is going to be to say when you look at the evidence carefully that actually isnt what occurred
7539910 basically the law on circumstantial evidence is such that if theres other reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the evidence the judge is obliged to consider those
7539911 its all stuff that can be dealt with by way of argument because if there are other inferences that can be drawn he judge silverman is obliged to consider them
7539912 hes so experienced as a former criminal defence lawyer himself that he is capable of doing that
7539913 if it was a jury trial it would have been substantially different

7539963 let me just read this one e mail this testimony may be a shocker to you but it proves that people who say the gospel of grace gives people license to sin are wrong just the opposite happens they find out how wonderful jesus is and that his unconditional grace is truly unconditional and that by his incredible love we actually get free of what oppresses us
7539964 for the last 10 years i have been addicted to internet pornography i have been involved in 3 churches in this time and i have confided to pastors who were good men and they suggested many things i also had many insights about ways i could get free but i could not stop my addiction
7539965 i attended church every week and was a zealous worshipper of jesus after 10 years of this i was absolutely desperate and was looking everywhere for an answer i wondered what would become of me yet i was more involved than ever
7539966 once i accepted that god accepted me totally on jesus performance alone the love of god flooded my being and it was then that i recognized and truly understood the magnitude of gods ongoing unconditional grace and it again dissolved my desire for pornography
7539967 it has been 3 months since i visited a pornographic website i am confident that i am free of this thing at last and have no desire for it i am writing this letter to confirm that this experience bears witness with the doctrine of the uncompromising grace of jesus christ as the truth i want to shout about gods love from the rooftops and advertise it in the newspaper that there is an answer
7539968 by this we shall come to know that we are of the truth and can reassure our hearts in his presence whenever our hearts in self accusation make us feel guilty and condemn us for he is above and greater than our consciences our hearts and he knows everything and beloved if our consciences our hearts do not accuse us if they do not make us feel guilty and condemn us we have confidence complete assurance and boldness before god
