4480025 it counts only those things that most people are likely to buy
4480026 so new products that are very expensive do not get included in the index until after their prices come down to a level where most people can afford them
4480027 everything cannot be included in an index both because of the enormous time and money this would require and because everything itself changes over time with the creation of new products and the disappearance of old ones
4480028 since the poverty rate has never been adjusted for real improvements in our standard of living its a dubious statistic for comparing the poor of today with the poor of yesterday
4480029 the poor today spend between two and three dollars for every dollar they earn which is why looking at consumption patterns suggests a very different picture of those supposedly living in poverty

4480088 probably the most important reference to jesus outside the new testament
4480089 bearing indirect testimony to the conviction of the early church that the christ who had been crucified had risen from the grave
4480090 unlike other gods who were worshipped christ was a person who had lived on earth
4480091 is suspect it implies that jesus was more than human and it is quite unlikely that josephus would have said
4480092 he is going forth to be stoned because he has practiced sorcery and enticed israel to apostasy
4480093 as schlomo pines and david flusser stated it is quite plausible that none of the arguments against josephus writing the original words even applies to the arabic text especially since the latter would have had less chance of being censored by the church
4480094 at this time there was a wise man who was called jesus his conduct was good and he was known to be virtuous and many people from among the jews and the other nations became his disciples pilate condemned him to be crucified and to die but those who had become his disciples did not abandon his discipleship they reported that he had appeared to them three days after his crucifixion and that he was alive accordingly he was perhaps the messiah concerning whom the prophets have recounted wonders

4480102 we dont really care who were playing all we want to do is get back out on the pitch and try to make up for monday night
4480103 we just want to put the memory of the hamilton game behind us as quickly as we can
4480104 the biggest thing is that we know we probably couldnt play any worse than we did
4480105 i reckon we could be as much as 75 better this weekend that shows how bad we were on monday but also tells you how much scope we have for improvement as well
4480106 we were up in the air and two guys who were surprisingly a lot older than us started fights
4480107 then we had to be redirected to venice for a couple of hours the police came on and had to get them off
4480108 they had a couple of drinks on them they were extremely aggressive one of the guys half way through the flight stood up and started smashing the overhead compartments
4480109 there were loads of girls and a couple of children and i think some people felt a bit threatened
4480110 the incident occurred in italian airspace at approximately 10pm irish time where a number of passengers were involved in an incident on board
4480111 the captain then made the decision for the safety of all on board to divert to venice where the aircraft was met by members of the italian police
4480112 five people were removed from the aircraft by italian police and the remaining passengers continued their flight approximately two hours later and have arrived safely in heraklion
4480113 hamilton have a good blend of youth and experience and a bunch of guys that look like they are desperate to do well and when that happens you always get a good response
4480114 both teams will be going into it in a positive frame of mind after positive results it is going to be a tough game for us
4480115 i was especially pleased with our togetherness the way we passed the ball and the way we competed against aberdeen
4480116 i was excited about the start of this season because of the way pre season had gone
4480117 i think the preparation has been excellent and i was confident we would start the season well
4480118 the boys are full of enthusiasm and have points to prove
4480119 one thing i can guarantee is that there will be no lack of trying on our part this season and we are not going out to play for a point we will try to win as we will do in every game this season
4480120 its always nice whatever league you are in to get off to a good start
4480121 fortunately we did the right things against united a lot of people said united didnt play well but i think a lot of that was down to the way we played

4480132 it was disappointing not to start as youre always looking to be in the team for the first game of the season
4480133 but the manager said its going to be a long season and to keep my head up
4480134 ive been lucky and ryan oleary has been unlucky and ive managed to get back in the team and hopefully ill stay there
4480135 itll be a hard game but looking at the results from last weekend inverness winning hamilton winning and st mirren playing well its going to be a hard league this year and you wont get an easy game this season

4480266 a large contingent of georgia army national guard soldiers flew to the republic of georgia on sunday for joint military exercises at a time when tension is brewing in the region
4480267 ever since the continents started interacting politically some five hundred years ago eurasia has been the center of world power
4480268 it is imperative that no eurasian challenger emerges capable of dominating eurasia and thus of also challenging america the formulation of a comprehensive and integrated eurasian geostrategy is therefore the purpose of this book
4480269 how america manages eurasia is critical a power that dominates eurasia would control two of the worlds three most advanced and economically productive regions a mere glance at the map also suggests that control over eurasia would almost automatically entail africas subordination rendering the western hemisphere and oceania geopolitically peripheral to the worlds central continent about 75 per cent of the worlds people live in eurasia and most of the worlds physical wealth is there as well both in its enterprises and underneath its soil eurasia accounts for about three fourths of the worlds known energy resources

4480276 neurologists say that the self is a construct of the neurons of your mind firing away in their chemical condition creating the illusion of the self
4480277 it is very hard to imagine that all that i experience is absolute illusion if i could get there passivity takes over and questions of purpose and intention become much more important
4480278 and more importantly is there a force which is actively involved in our existence i mean is there some higher power who is actually concerned about my well being
4480279 what you are referring to is the contemporary dogma developed by a certain strain of modern christian interpretation of a collection of books that we no longer have original copies of
4480280 in short you are reflecting the teachings of men a thousand years dead who for the most part were far more concerned with maintaining the status quo of their day than they were in preserving the souls of the lost
4480281 new translations of the existing work and brand new denominational viewpoints were established in forward thinking groups as a result groups like that salvation army rose up to minister to the needy rather that merely stand in their piety many others began a movement away from slavish idolatry of the bible and toward a more healing view of their fellow human beings

4480288 people have been dreaming up religious crap for thousands of years with the sole intention of controlling others with their gods firmly in their heavens the egyptians could build mighty pyramids the greeks could espouse great philosophies the incas could construct lofty cities in the sky if thor hadnt ruled in valhalla what viking would have ever gotten on those little boats

4480295 its only in our puritan influenced western minds that sex becomes a dirty word unfit to be discussed this is the attitude that drove the victorians of our country to such grand hypocrisy and were still suffering with that today
4480296 sex is a good thing a pleasant thing and can even be a holy thing if we will look at it from the correct perspective we should be doing more of what comes naturally
4480297 it is a good thing that we can sensibly discuss these matters too many times ignorance and fear have kept our ancestors from truly searching such questions our history is filled with examples of religious bigotry acting in horrific ways but it is only when we put away our preconceived notions and entertain this search with open minds that a living faith can be isolated
4480298 some have said that gods will must not be doubted it has often led to violence in the past and continues to in this hour a god who cannot stand up to inspection is surely an idol while it is the nature of man to have gods we must always question our gods these have most often been personified but lately have become much more esoteric science or technology or wealth or power or on and on the human spirit however does seem to require a higher power mentality etc without it we would probably all go insane turning upon each other like the animals we are said to be

4480417 the first half of 2008 has continued to be a challenge to the entire alternative fuels industry in all markets however it is our firm belief that the global opportunities for clean burning renewable fuels have never been greater and timelier despite the challenges o2diesel continues to provide optimum near and long term solutions to many of the problems being encountered globally with the need to improve air quality and reduce our dependence on oil the balance of 2008 should see many of the projects we have begun over the past several years maturing the development of o28 for the u s air force has continued to move forward and we expect to conclude the final testing and to obtain a decision on their wide scale use of this fuel by late summer or early fall in europe the tests conducted at veolia transit have as anticipated gone very well as evidenced by their press conference in april our efforts in south america continue as we seek greater market awareness in paraguay and colombia as part of our effort to streamline our operations and cut our overhead we have continued to execute cost saving measures throughout the organization by remaining focused on commercial implementation via strategic partnerships with companies that will help support the costs of developing our target markets while participating in the economic benefits our progress in this area has allowed us to reduce operating expense for the first half of the year by nearly 40 and we fully anticipate expanding this strategy into new untapped markets
4480418 we remain very optimistic about our new partnership with kl process design group kl announced earlier his year their position as a leader in the development of cellulosic based ethanol cbe process technology and the fact that they have built and are operating a small commercial scale plant in upton wyoming has enabled us to create a lot of interest in the commercial application of this technology with potential partners in europe and south america this enthusiastic response demonstrates that we are in a position with kl to be at the forefront in the roll out of second generation ethanol technology which will further support our strategy to vertically integrate with ethanol production to obtain a greater percentage of the value created with every gallon of o2diesel sold we are confident that the remainder of 2008 will bring positive change for the company
4480419 many of the participants in this event view it as an opportunity to validate themselves as grapplers in particular despite the fact that they are already established their reputations in mma in general
4480420 it has been interesting observing mma fighters from different systems as they embraced grappling a significant number of our fighters come to mma with an opinion that their particular form is superior to another but quickly learned two things 1 no one system is better than another the preparation and heart of the fighter are most crucial to success but 2 in order to succeed in mma all fighters will invariably find themselves on the floor and the fighter best proficient in grappling will probably prevail
4480421 we are pleased to be the exclusive energy drink sponsor for this action packed event
4480422 when people travel long distances at their own expense to compete they arrive with a goal of making their trip worthwhile to win
4480423 our company continues to distribute our energy drink tablet at venues like this and recognize it as a viable platform for promoting the brand
4480424 we are already engaged in major initiatives consisting of advertising and distribution strategies that will result in increased brand awareness over the coming months throughout the u s mexico and other parts of latin america events like this grappling tournament and our previous sponsorship of mma matches sumo wrestling and even on and off track race car driving have also proven to be of tremendous benefit
4480425 weve monitored our sales and have noticed that our sales consistently increase when the season arrives for students to study for final exams they know and trust it
4480426 once we discontinued giving away samples we were inundated with requests through our web site to sell them the product last year during the spring break season we had to hire extra help to adequately respond to these requests because they wanted to use eq as a party supplement that led us to adopt the slogan you gotta have it

4480431 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
4480432 jerome corsi is a discredited liar who is peddling another piece of garbage to continue the bush cheney politics he helped perpetuate four years ago
4480433 his is just one of what will likely be many more lie filled books rushed to print this election cycle which are cobbled together from debunked internet sources to make money and advance a partisan agenda we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means at our disposal
4480434 if obama takes pains to hide his smoking from us what else does he take pains to hide
4480435 im putting this question forward im putting the evidence forward voters can make up their own minds

4480443 regarded this state of affairs as normal certain and permanent except in the direction of further improvement the projects and politics of militarism and imperialism of racial and cultural rivalries of monopolies restrictions and exclusion appeared to exercise almost no influence at all on the ordinary course of social and economic life the internationalization of which was nearly complete in practice
4480444 while youre asking if theres going to be a touch device why not ask if theres going to be a flip has there ever been a successful flip smart phone
4480445 during the time that iphone was launched we sold more blackberrys because what happened people suddenly start looking at technology and suddenly understand that it is for them too i think weve moved well beyond this idea that high tech belongs in the boardroom belongs to a certain class of individual only because now that technology is now being adopted by people from all walks of life and its not all about work
4480446 i think what happened was the amount of marketing and the attention they apple generated in the market the customers are now coming to the store and saying i didnt know you could do all that with a phone and when they get there they realize theres a selection theres not just one device and so what its actually done is increased our sales

4480454 as soldiers prepare for conflict the department of defense may call on the neurophysiology community to assist in maintaining the warfighting superiority of the united states commanders will ask how they can make their troops learn faster how can they increase the speed with which their soldiers process large amounts of information quickly and accurately how can the neurosciences help soldiers to make the correct decision in the difficult environment of wartime operations
4480455 although conflict has many aspects one that warfighters and policy makers often talk about is the motivation to fight which undoubtedly has its origins in the brain and is reflected in peripheral neurophysiological processes
4480456 so one question would be how can we disrupt the enemys motivation to fight other questions raised by controlling the mind how can we make people trust us more what if we could help the brain to remove fear or pain is there a way to make the enemy obey our commands as cognitive neuroscience and related technologies become more pervasive using technology for nefarious purposes becomes easier
4480457 the brain is viewed as the organ most associated with personal identity
4480458 there is sure to be enormous societal interest in any prospective manipulation of neural processes
4480459 the fear that this approach to fighting war might be developed will be justification for developing countermeasures to possible cognitive weapons this escalation might lead to innovations that could cause this market area to expand rapidly tests would need to be developed to determine if a soldier had been harmed by a cognitive weapon and there would be a need for a prophylactic of some sort
4480460 the concept of torture could also be altered by products in this market it is possible that someday there could be a technique developed to extract information from a prisoner that does not have any lasting side effects

4480462 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
4480463 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past
4480464 hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historic facts and personages appear so to speak twice he forgot to add the first time as tragedy the second time as farce
4480465 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
4480466 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
4480467 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
4480468 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
4480469 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
4480470 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
4480471 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
4480472 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
4480473 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
4480474 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
4480475 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

4480485 the swearing was done in accordance with islamic rules and after i sought advice from religious elders on how to do it correctly this is the best way for me to obtain justice on earth and on judgment day i seek solace from allah and for the return of my dignity
4480486 i do not wish to twist and turn the matter as anwar did
4480487 it has nothing to with politics it is between anwar and me
4480488 i kept quiet because i needed time to gather my strength because i had been accused of all kinds of malicious remarks especially by anwar
4480489 i had long wanted to do so however it needed mental and spiritual strength because this is not an easy thing because the consequence is incurring the wrath of god
4480490 thankfully allah gave me strength for me to perform it today and to face the press
4480491 it is more important for these politicians to tackle the problem of price hikes than this thing with the president
4480492 i dont mind if it is musharraf or any other politician i just want someone to give us some solace from these high prices
4480493 we see a lot of distress in families and the rate of suicides have increased significantly
4480494 some independent research is showing that poverty indicators like infant and maternal mortality rates are on the increase
4480495 we did not adequately invest in power generation and this is now stunting our growth
4480496 our industrial sector and our exports are being affected by this power shortage
4480497 this load shedding is causing so many problems for us

4480526 the funds raised from this years event will support our local efforts to end childhood hunger and supply low income families with the foods they need to lead healthy active lives
4480527 i thought this is definitely not what i want to do

4480548 a large contingent of georgia army national guard soldiers flew to the republic of georgia on sunday for joint military exercises at a time when tension is brewing in the region
4480549 ever since the continents started interacting politically some five hundred years ago eurasia has been the center of world power
4480550 it is imperative that no eurasian challenger emerges capable of dominating eurasia and thus of also challenging america the formulation of a comprehensive and integrated eurasian geostrategy is therefore the purpose of this book
4480551 how america manages eurasia is critical a power that dominates eurasia would control two of the worlds three most advanced and economically productive regions a mere glance at the map also suggests that control over eurasia would almost automatically entail africas subordination rendering the western hemisphere and oceania geopolitically peripheral to the worlds central continent about 75 per cent of the worlds people live in eurasia and most of the worlds physical wealth is there as well both in its enterprises and underneath its soil eurasia accounts for about three fourths of the worlds known energy resources

4480557 the federal government congress in 2005 passed the deficit reduction act
4480558 let me ask you this as somebody who works with child support issues when you first heard about this what was your reaction
4480559 i do not have a favorable view about fees but my job as the administrator of the child support program in michigan is to implement federal and state law and that is a federal law
4480560 essentially we are taking money away that is intended for the direct care of children to pay down the federal deficit
4480561 the fee is coming from child support payments that otherwise would have gone to the families
4480562 what do you tell the single mom who called me who watches every dime this 25 dollars makes a difference what do you tell them that now they are going to have to make it work
4480563 fees are always going to be difficult and certainly this fee is going to impact parents who are already struggling to pay their bills in this difficult economic times but my responsibility is to implement the law the federal government has passed
4480564 16 dollars or 66 of each of these 25 fees michigan sends to the federal government michigan retains the balance and we did look into weather we could implement just the 16 fee and that was not permitted under the federal language
4480565 the greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated

4480572 the internet service providers isp they were able to trace were from saudi arabia iran and other middle eastern countries
4480573 it became clear that these donations were very likely coming from sources other than american voters
4480574 a new e mail being circulated about obamas tax proposals is almost entirely false alert readers may already have noted that this chain e mail does not provide links to any of obamas actual proposals or cite any sources for the claims it makes that is because they are made up this widely distributed message is so full of misinformation that we find it impossible to believe that it is the result of simple ignorance or carelessness on the part of the writer almost nothing it says about obamas tax proposals is true we conclude that this deception is deliberate
4480575 my guess would be it would be significantly lower than that

4480615 so if anyone wants to talk about barry in the future they must talk with the owner rick parry or the chief executive of aston villa
4480616 i was not involved in the talks about barry i was not involved in the talks about xabi alonso and arsenal if you want to talk about these players you must talk to the chief executive of our club who was handling the discussions

4480632 considering the tournament takes place on the sub continent the selection committee has opted for two spinners

4480634 like any top sportsman who senses he or she has the ability we are obviously disappointed to have so narrowly missed out on victory in june
4480635 we now have every intention of keeping up our effort in order to be in a position to top the podium in 2009
4480636 we have called on our core driver line up for this race but marc christian pedro and st phane will be joined by alexander and christian there are two reasons behind this decision to begin with they are both available while at the same time this race will give them a chance to gain extra experience of endurance racing
4480637 as last junes le mans showed it takes experience to take on a competitor that has the benefit of 10 years of this race behind it and which stays match fit by contesting 12 more races during the season compared with peugeot

4480657 steinbr ck muss im haushalts oder finanzausschuss rede und antwort stehen
4480658 having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of jesus
4480659 with the precious blood of christ who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you
4480660 who hath saved us and called us with a holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in christ jesus 2 tim 1 9 granted that israels sins are to be forgiven by the same blood that was shed for the church on the cross but that is where any semblance between the two ceases the church is already made now in christ jesus ye who once were far off are made near by the blood of christ
4480661 and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus that in the ages to come including the millennial kingdom age he might show to the angels redeemed israel and the redeemed gentile nations the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through christ jesus
4480662 after those days saith the lord i will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts
4480663 and i will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and ye shall keep mine ordinances and do them
4480664 for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death
4480665 we all with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord
4480666 this eternal covenant of hebrews 13 20 was not between creatures but between the god of peace and the lord jesus and the condition was obedience unto death of christ to the father its ground the shed blood of the son and its issue an eternal covenant
4480667 this is the great fundamental transaction between the father and the son no creatures are seen but oh believers become apart from works blessed
4480668 the new covenant yet to be made with israel and judah at our lords return to earth and that nation is all of grace
4480669 this is the eternal covenant of which the lord jesus is said to be the mediator and which is celebrated in the lords supper in view of his death on our behalf by those benefited forever thereby

4480671 harrold texas a tiny texas school district may be the first in the nation to allow teachers and staff to pack guns for protection when classes begin later this month a newspaper reported trustees at the harrold independent school district approved a district policy change last october so employees can carry concealed firearms to deter and protect against school shootings provided the gun toting teachers follow certain requirements
4480672 so get rid of your old self which made you live as you used to the old self which was being destroyed by its deceitful desires your hearts and minds must be made completely new you must put on the new self which is being created in gods likeness

4480675 gone gone from new york city where you gonna go with a head that empty where you gonna with a heart that gone
4480676 toen ik jong was had je het festival van het licht op de langste dag van het jaar
4480677 het was de enige dag van het jaar waarop iets te beleven viel in mijn woonplaats
4480678 op organisatorisch gebied mogen we ontzettend trots zijn op nederland er is zoveel keuze en heel veel van die evenementen zijn norm succesvol
4480679 internationaal maar zeker ook in nederland sinds de opkomst van de house is er veel veranderd house is van een piepkleine subcultuur tot een volwassen stroming uitgegroeid
4480680 op mysteryland wordt in n dag alles uit de kast gehaald de week erna kunnen liefhebbers weer naar een ander festival dat dat ook doet er is veel te beleven en het is elke week anders
4480681 je ziet het aan de vele festivals maar ook aan een bedrijf als idt en aan een evenement als dance valley deze instituten zijn in de rest van de wereld toonaangevend gebleken
4480682 er wordt veel meer nederlandse dance op cd verkocht dan muziek van within temptation en jan smit en vergeet niet dat trance djs als armin van buuren en ti sto op wereldtournee stadions vol publiek trekken ik wil hen niet met de rolling stones vergelijken maar er gaan wel miljoenen mensen naartoe
4480683 op sensation zie ik meer mensen sociaal en gezellig doen dan uit hun dak gaan
4480684 ik kom nu op feesten waar dance niet meer dan muzikaal behang is niemand gaat er meer echt voor
4480685 er valt zoveel geld te verdienen dat bedrijven die grote evenementen organiseren aan de veilige kant blijven djs ook het publiek loopt snel weg als een dj even niet boeit
4480686 discotheken en clubs hebben het moeilijk het aantal clubs is de laatste jaren flink gedaald ik heb de tijden nog meegemaakt dat mensen vrijdag zaterdag en zondag naar dezelfde club gingen dat is nu ondenkbaar de eendaagse evenementen zijn populairder
4480687 vroeger was een feest van circa 4500 bezoekers erg groot nu niet meer als ik de engelse media mag geloven worden de kleinere evenementen weer populair dat betekent niet meer in de rij staan voor lauw bier en vette hamburgers maar de terugkeer van een persoonlijkere benadering
4480688 een groot feest met een dj in n kolossale hal is niet meer genoeg een evenement als sensation doet dat nog wel maar daar is de aankleding weer tot in detail verzorgd grote festivals cre ren veel kleine plekken op hun festivalterrein
4480689 kijk naar mysteryland dat is net zo strak georganiseerd als lowlands en trekt meer bezoekers bezoekers zijn geen randjongeren maar hebben een baan en kinderen muzikaal zijn er bovendien zoveel vertakkingen je kunt niet meer praten over d dance er zijn stromingen als ambient happy trance hardcore dubstep
4480690 auch mir gef llt nette bei n herer bekanntschaft immer besser sie mag wohl manche fr here schw che abgelegt haben und zeigt sich jetzt nur von einer wirklichen gutm thigen und liebensw rdigen seite sie ist voller gef lligkeit und aufmerksamkeit f r uns
4480691 ich glaube wirklich die hat den b sen d mon in sich bezwungen aber freilich nicht ohne wunden davonzutragen und macht sie das nicht tausendmal interessanter menschlicher und f higer eine solche dichterin zu werden als wenn sie die hehre k hle unnahbare jungfrau gewesen w re zu der die nachwelt sie macht
4480692 recent advances in nutrition and education could be in jeopardy if food prices remain high
4480693 countries will need to expand investment in social protection programs in order to ease the impact of the crisis
4480694 results for all exams are excellent which is a reflection on the standard of provision and level of tutoring on the national school programmes
4480695 the new public sector optional units give the specialist input and underpinning knowledge needed to reinforce understanding of current public procurement policy and issues such as sustainability public accountability and good governance
4480696 manufacturing is a vital sector of the uk economy accounting for over 50 of our exports and the uk is the worlds sixth biggest manufacturer given the uks high wage economy future productivity and global competitiveness depend upon our ability to develop high quality clever technology and products major investment in innovative research and development such as the twenty million pounds announced today will enable us to maintain and improve the quality of the uks manufacturing capability in key areas such as aerospace healthcare energy and recycling
4480697 there are some great examples of manufacturing technologies and innovation happening here in the uk these successful projects reflect the changing nature of manufacturing and we are investing in the uk to enable it to maintain its place as one of the worlds leading manufacturing locations
4480698 the countrys strategy aims at maximum use of business development programs services and institutions to enhance the cluster competitive environment
4480699 at the same time argentina s production council is working on ways to better coordinate and mesh provincial and national business development policies
4480700 the program s basic idea is that a company s competitiveness depends not just on its own behavior or the business climate in which it is operating but also on the actions of other companies and institutions and their interactions
4480701 the focus of this program is to remedy failures in coordination that constrain success
4480702 this expansion will introduce mobile phone services to remote and war torn areas which lag far behind in the nations reconstruction efforts and for which telecom services are vital
4480703 it will give people in remote areas better access to markets access to information and will support families and communities that are often fragmented it will also be a great boost for the private sector by helping businesses access new parts of the country
4480704 drivers who kill through carelessness will no longer be able to walk away from court with just a fine
4480705 neither should uninsured or unlicensed drivers who deliberately flout the law
4480706 driving requires full concentration at all times a moments distraction can make the difference between life and death
4480707 the government is committed to continually improving safety on britains roads
4480708 last year the number of people killed fell below 3 000 for the first time since records began in 1926 but eight people are still dying on the roads each day where carelessness or an uninsured disqualified or unlicensed driver causes a death it is right that the driver should face tough penalties
4480709 careless drivers put themselves and others at risk every time they get behind the wheel of a car
4480710 despite good progress in recent years to reduce the number of people killed or seriously injured on the uks roads more can be done to prevent the unnecessary loss of life the introduction of this legislation will hit home the message that driving is a hazardous activity that requires total concentration allowing distractions to affect your standard of driving is not acceptable and will now be more appropriately punished under the law
4480711 these statistics reveal a worrying trend and make it abundantly clear that the credit crunch is coming home to roost and i fear that it wont be too long before we see a rise in repossessions in london potentially leading to increased homelessness
4480712 a 9 per cent increase in the overall repossession claims over the last quarter compared to the same period last year masks a number of repossession claim hot spots across the capital where the increase is over 20 percentage
4480713 this is exactly why london councils is developing models on how councils can come to the rescue of their communities either by offering mortgages themselves or by supporting people at risk of becoming homeless through repossession
4480714 local government has lost one of its foremost advocates with the sad death of lord bruce lockhart today
4480715 sandy bruce lockhart epitomised the very best of what a politician should be courteous good humoured and passionate for doing whats right
4480716 as leader of kent county council he gained a reputation for delivery for pioneering policy innovations and was part of that vanguard of civic leaders contributing to the revival of local government fortunes
4480717 when sandy became the first conservative chairman of the local government association he worked tirelessly to promote local government winning plaudits from across the political spectrum
4480718 ook niet als ik weet wat er de komende maanden op me afkomt
4480719 reuk je nu de geur van angst stress euhhh nee nu toch niet
4480720 oh my god veedeo heeft de kracht van het nu gelezen
4480721 memorandum of understanding between the government of australia and the government of the republic of singapore concerning defence cooperation
4480722 our vision is for singapore to be a lively yet live able home with a vibrant economy and high quality living environment today many of us are concerned about higher fuel prices and ever increasing demand for resources while we must tackle these important issues the uncertainties remind us that we cannot just look at our present needs but should think ahead to secure our future singapore is our home not just for the current but also future generations by planning now for singapores sustainable development in the next 10 to 15 years we ensure two key things first we can be more efficient in using resources to grow our economy and stay competitive second we can ensure that even as our population grows all of us continue to enjoy clean air and clean water in an attractive quality living environment
4480723 we should play our part in reducing carbon emissions that lead to global warming if singapore can address energy conservation and efficiency with the same resolve as we have done in water management it will not only enable our economy to be more competitive but will add to our contribution to mitigating climate change
4480724 it is important for us to push for resource efficiency as an extension of our productivity movement as this will directly determine how cost competitive we can be in a resource constrained future having a clean green and healthy environment will also help singapore to attract talent and investments
4480725 public transport is by far the most efficient mode of transport both in terms of land and energy usage therefore a key strategy is to encourage a modal shift from private to public transport this is the reason why the government will be investing heavily in our public transport infrastructure to the tune of some 40 billion over the next 12 years our aim is to make public transport an attractive and choice mode to encourage a decisive shift to greater public transport usage even for those who can well afford cars this strategy will ensure sustainability a quality living environment and a more fuel efficient transport system as a whole
4480726 the imcsd will be pragmatic and result oriented it will assess the effectiveness and benefits of the various options against their costs to businesses and consumers we will set meaningful goals but pace the changes so that everyone can adjust smoothly
4480727 a sustainable singapore has to be built jointly by the government with the people and private sectors we hope that the public can offer us new policy ideas and practical suggestions on how the community and businesses can also contribute to efforts to make singapore cleaner greener and more resource efficient
4480728 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4480729 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4480730 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4480731 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4480732 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4480733 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4480734 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4480735 heute h rt paraguay auf ein land der sozialen ausgrenzung der geheimniskr merei und der korruption zu sein
4480736 achter gesloten deuren worden momenteel gesprekken gevoerd met de regeringscoalitie over een ontslag
4480737 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
4480738 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
4480739 the conservative party has no issue with the orange order it is a perfectly legal organisation and many of its members are engaged in charity and church work
4480740 co operation ireland has been very successful in a conflict situation for the last 30 years but the context has changed out there and the challenge will be to be as equally successful in the next 30 years of co operation ireland in a different context
4480741 youre in a peace building context people have this view that the peace is done and its all over and to some extent that part of the conflict is over but its by no means stable yet yes a lot of the engagement has been at the top political level but actually the grassroots hasnt been engaged in it
4480742 all of that political agreement needs stabilised and needs underpinned at the grassroots level which is what peacebuildings about in some ways the peace making is a pragmatic enterprise whereas peace building is much more vision oriented its not about single events its about process and a process that will take years and so the context becomes more difficult
4480743 international land border here which no other police force in the uk has
4480744 no one has gone public to say the army council has gone away
4480745 what i can say with absolute certainty is that in terms of pira activity that is to say terrorist activity its not happening
4480746 does it mean all the provos have gone into nine to five jobs of course it doesnt there are some involved in organised crime without a doubt but operating as individuals not operating as an organisation and i think thats the key distinguishing factor
4480747 on the other side of course it must be hugely frustrating to those who dont have that confidence
4480748 so i can understand i think the unionist community are going to look for a lot more than just a statement that pira have gone away before they are satisfied but we are not seeing activity
4480749 it pira has reduced in size but it is there
4480750 the organisation is dedicated to following a political path but it will not disband to the point where it could not carry out an operation if it needed to
4480751 anyone who can help us prevent this type of activity should come forward to the police
4480752 those responsible for planting these devices show a callous disregard for human life
4480753 those responsible seem intent on following their own selfish agenda and the only way for communities to be free from such activity is to help officers bring these criminals before the courts
4480754 there was no claim of responsibility but dissident republicans were suspected of being responsible the devices were being examined
4480755 formal consultation on equality impact assessment eqia of northside urban village draft regeneration framework
4480756 the dup was relentlessly trying to interfere in the uup tory talks and would not be ditching its support and links with the order
4480757 party policy for the rest of the uk has to reflect different situations in other regions unlike northern ireland most parts of gb do not have a selection based post primary system therefore party policy has to reflect different local circumstances
4480758 enceladus has got warmth water and organic chemicals some of the essential building blocks needed for life
4480759 we have quite a recipe for life on our hands but we have yet to find the final ingredient liquid water but enceladus is only whetting our appetites for more
4480760 there were very few vacant spots along the shore as crowds waved from prescott park the portsmouth naval shipyard and along the sarah mildred long bridge
4480761 we have five ships with the four tall ships and our own gundalow this is history making for us
4480762 its an original ship and represents a time when people were not only fishing but were racing these schooners
4480763 what in the world is winning with your unique opportunities
4480764 focuses on seven case studies including the office of the prime minister and the foreign and commonwealth office that highlight the factors that help and hinder online engagement the report finds that many government departments remain wary of using the internet to engage because it is new and unfamiliar
4480765 a series of radical proposals that would reverse the trend and inject a much needed momentum back into regeneration policy
4480766 aside from the avoidable loss of innocent life one the most depressing things about the past few days is the lack of intellectual honesty on display rather than examine motive and facts on the ground both russians and georgians have chosen to extract what they wish from the overall picture and used it to fit their pre existing nationalist ideologies
4480767 how do we cope with the complexity of the modern world and foster local and global solidarity in the face of diversity and individualism solutions to these challenges will come from our growing desire to shape our neurological processes
4480768 should resist the temptation to ignore either his critique of the west or the importance of his religious faith in directing the analysis he gave
4480769 however unpalatable this conflict may be for us it is better to take a tough but non violent stance against moscow today than to pursue a policy of appeasement that will pave the way to a more dangerous and potentially violent conflict with russia tomorrow
4480770 his family never warmed to the way he was portrayed and when you read his life story you can understand why
4480771 ive sat on the veranda at rorkes drift many times and its truly frightening to imagine the position they were in
4480772 we often get people asking us about the characters in the film but they need to remember film is not real
4480773 if they need a fall guy why not the guy who s blown shit up all across town and happily murdered people right and left to the point where three or four more hardly would ve made a difference they ve got the joker
4480774 atheism is a belief the same way that not collecting stamps is a hobby
4480775 please dont fail me wooden board you are my only friend
4480776 if you spend enough time here youll be the zebra eventually
4480777 atheism is a belief the same way that not collecting stamps is a hobby
4480778 as a citizen of the united states and speaking for the us as a whole we do now officially disown and disavow the rpg net poster known as zenten he does not speak for us and his opinions in no way reflect the opinions or attitudes of the united states or its populance please do not refer to him as an american that is our word and he has no claim upon it
4480779 that which does not kill me only serves to make me stronger
4480780 because we have sinned against an infinitely holy god we have sinned infinitely and deserve infinite punishment eternal seperation from god that is hell
4480781 this is a staggering example of self deception common sense morality being sacrificed in order to reconcile it with a narrow interpretation of a holy book
4480782 and fears that if one part of it were shown to be false then one might as well throw the whole thing on the trash heap
4480783 and frankly agrees that having shown one part of it to be false one might as well disregard the whole thing
4480784 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4480785 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4480786 to begin repairing relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must respect the freedom of its neighbors
4480787 the cold war is over the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us
4480788 moscow must honor its commitment to withdraw its invading forces from all georgian territory
4480789 in the years since its gained independence after the soviet unions collapse georgias become a courageous democracy
4480790 its people are making the tough choices that are required of free societies since the rose revolution in 2003 the georgian people have held free elections opened up their economy and built the foundations of a successful democracy
4480791 the people of georgia have cast their lot with the free world and we will not cast them aside
4480792 free and prosperous societies on russias borders will advance russias interests by serving as sources of stability and economic opportunity
4480793 a few days ago french president nicolas sarkozy got agreement on the six points from the russians and then from the georgians
4480794 and there was agreement on these points as a set of principles it now needs to be a formal ceasefire and thats what were working on
4480795 im going to now talk to president saakashvili about the clarifications that the french have provided
4480796 and then well try to get this formal ceasefire in place because the goal of this is to get a ceasefire and to get russian forces to withdraw from the country asap as soon as possible
4480797 there were enormous complexities and there are some loose ends that we have not nailed down we have figured out most of the solutions however
4480798 weve made enough progress on our system issues to begin shipping from some of our distribution centers today and will continue to work though the night to have shipments available to run all distribution centers tomorrow friday
4480799 were not real big on pointing fingers or attaching blame or airing this out in public
4480800 i probably wouldnt have noticed if they hadnt informed me
4480801 this time the sites been up but our shipping system is down its worse than it was in march were really backlogged
4480802 these costs could be offset by savings elsewhere either by buying less streaming content or spending less on marketing
4480803 one thing thats possible is that she was still owed money from what shed done before for the political action committee but obviously there are less charitable explanations
4480804 i talked to john tuesday and hes not doing well
4480805 hes just to be very frank with you hes just not doing well he needs to be concentrating on himself and his family at this point in his life hes a good boy he just made a hell of a mistake
4480806 yes i can see the move is bothering you and it reminds me of when our family moved from colorado to kansas
4480807 weve used these with dozens of client organizations even in my
4480808 these unsubstantiated spate of reports are totally baseless and malicious
4480809 there is a lot of background talks going on whereby a way is trying to be found so that there is no impeachment
4480810 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4480811 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4480812 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4480813 we have conveyed to them that the coalition is determined for impeachment and if he wants to save himself the best way is for him to quit
4480814 if a person moves to the side we are not in the habit of bothering him this would not be a good attitude if someone is lying on the ground and we go aggressively against him
4480815 at the present stage there is merit in the contention that the article put up by the defendant on the blog site is defamatory
4480816 why waste the month of august cleaning your office make the most of your summer by seizing new business opportunities while your competition plays miniature golf most business owners and salespeople assume making calls in august is pointless because decision makers are on vacation while its true that most people do vacation in august i dont know anyone who goes away for 4 weeks straight what does this mean for you it means people are at their desks often in good moods and are more likely to pick up their phones to speak with you seize this valuable opportunity and boost your business by following these 7 key strategies in august
4480817 24 95 they were 49 95 and free shipping after these copies are gone youll have to get them from tom directly in australia toms techniques really work
4480818 thats because the vitamin gives off an odor when you perspire that is unattractive to insects but undetectable to humans

4480828 the new ka is the perfect match for the character of camille adventurous individual and thoroughly modern
4480829 we are delighted that the launch of the film coincides with the launch of such a significant new model for ford of europe
4480830 if you think about it all the parts and components are common from the wagon to the sedan
4480831 the wagon is the same as the sedan from the rear doors forward so theres nothing stopping us from doing that
4480832 well what do you think what would you say about that vehicle
4480833 the addition of this dramatically designed sport wagon is well synchronized with todays changing consumer tastes as a compelling alternative to suvs or other larger vehicles
4480834 this is an important step in cadillacs ongoing global expansion and of course in international markets like europe wagons have been and continue to be very significant
4480835 the cts sport wagon is an important expansion to the cadillac lineup worldwide
4480836 its a taut design that not only suggests sleekness but delivers it
4480837 indeed the drama of the sedan is amplified in the cts sport wagon as the centerline cue that is part of the exterior and interior is more prominent and plays a stronger role in defining the design at the rear of the vehicle
4480838 the more you study the rear of the cts sport wagon the more you see
4480839 functionality was certainly a guiding factor during development but so was the idea to inject emotion into the normally sedate wagon category
4480840 theyre not fins in the classic sense but they work to help disguise the cargo load system and yes they acknowledge cadillacs design heritage
4480841 we were under severe pressure by the taliban militants for the past several days
4480842 we had asked the government to send reinforcement but nobody was sent
4480843 in order to avoid casualties we have tactically withdrawn from the district and as we get reinforcement we will recapture the district
4480844 after some 15 police forces were killed in the past two weeks we decided to leave those two posts in the district
4480845 if our peacekeeping troops and our citizens are attacked we will respond in the future in the same way that we have responded let there be no doubt about this

4480849 we have the impression that saakashvili is opposed to the diplomacy of the past 15 years
4480850 we dont want a long or short term warming of relations with the european union with the united states or with other countries
4480851 women and children were murdered churches packed with refugees set alight and entire villages razed
4480852 what we appreciate in the relations with our german partners is the confidence and the commitment to listen to each other
4480853 of course this does not mean that we are always of the same opinion
4480854 turkey is the most important country for the delivery of gas to europe
4480855 we can assume the extraordinary times are over for now
4480856 repair work is not progressing as much as we want due to some security concerns no real progress
4480857 more and better educated engineers are needed if our nation and its auto industry are to thrive or even survive
4480858 the downturn in the economy appears to be continuing longer than anyone previously anticipated and so were being proactive in how we address whats happening
4480859 the reductions were tough but necessary given the volume fluctuations and we opted to do them all in one day to minimize disruption to employees and this business
4480860 not counting pseudo drivers avast consumes around 70mb of memory compared to 8mb for antivir i didnt do any formal testing of cpu consumption or timing of various common operations but there was no doubt in my mind that avast noticeably slowed several common operations like program loading and file copying
4480861 there has been a lot of misinformation circulating about plasma hdtvs and longevity and were happy to once again set the record straight on the durability of panasonic plasma
4480862 our plasma tvs are built to last a very long time
4480863 high proportion of recommendations of lcd sets is primarily due to retail salespersons lack of knowledge regarding recent improvements in plasma technology
4480864 despite what consumers may hear from misinformed sources plasma is the right choice for educated consumers looking for stunning picture quality and the ultimate big screen viewing experience
4480865 without education and the right and proper education no human being can fulfill his or her destiny

4480888 an air of nervousness has afflicted the business to homeowner sector as we have witnessed a marked increase in organisations taking a much tougher almost relentless attitude to recovering overdue debts prushka ceo roger mendelson said
4480889 the trend has become quite noticeable prushka is receiving accounts from this sector at a much earlier stage in the cycle than previously with businesses less open to negotiate terms directly with their customers
4480890 now for the first time we have tangible signs that the last interest rate rise has started to bite
4480891 our best test of the changing environment is in tracking our existing clients said mr mendelson
4480892 their debts are fresher which means that they are under pressure for the money that is owed to them
4480893 the feedback is that it is becoming harder to collect the money thats owed
4480894 but this isnt happening with business to business clients he said
4480895 the household budget is now under more pressure while business cash flows are still reasonably strong
4480896 they are now tightening up on the credit they allow mr mendelson said
4480897 they are not concerned if they upset a client instead they are putting pressure on them
4480898 this would be difficult to do in a competitive market
4480899 all they can do is take more care in allowing the credit they used to offer

4480904 mccains most dramatic possible play would be the selection of lieberman a democrat who was only eight years earlier his partys nominee for vice president and after losing his own partys line in a senate reelection bid in 2006 and winning instead as an independent now calls himself an independent democrat in selecting lieberman mccain would be doubling down on the central bet of his candidacy that aexperience gravitas and a willingness to buck the leaders of his own party out of a sense of integrity and what the american people need will trump youth dynamism charisma in choosing lieberman mccain can credibly say that he is the candidate of change in 2008 a candidate of political change willing to throw out partisan categories in pursuit of two specific goals

4480909 wisconsin falls from ranks of top 10 highest taxed states for first time since 1980

4480935 this is a case which inevitably brings with it a great deal of emotion and i am aware of that emotion and i understand but i have to be careful that i dont get swept up in it
4480936 abbie was a three year old girl and i have listened carefully to the victim impact statements that have been read out and i have also read another statement that showed the devastation that the family feel
4480937 abbie was a three year old girl who should not have been on that motorcycle on the pavement there was no insurance there was no mot
4480938 you were the holder of a provisional driving licence who had had five lessons when you were 17 you are now 23
4480939 the last thing that you wanted was for any harm to come to abbie and i accept that and i accept your remorse
4480940 you were riding on the pavement neither of you had a helmet and people nearby who saw what was happening realised immediately that what you were doing was obviously very dangerous
4480941 as one witness described it was incredibly dangerous and as another sadly prophesied there would be an accident sadly she was right
4480942 as i said at the previous hearing this was on your part an act of crass stupidity
4480943 this sentence is in no way meant to be a measure of the value of abbies life no one can put a value on abbies life like any life it is priceless
4480944 i remember in detail franklin carrying abbie in his arms there was no movement
4480945 i panicked i didnt know what to do i just couldnt believe what was happening
4480946 i knew something was terribly wrong when the nurses at the hospital spoke to me
4480947 i could see it in their faces and then the doctors told me she was dead
4480948 it felt like someone had ripped my heart out and stamped on it
4480949 when i saw her in the hospital she was lying there lifeless her head swollen with blood matted hair
4480950 i had to say my final farewell to her at the graveside i couldnt focus on it it was just too upsetting
4480951 every day i wake up and i think of abbie her cheeky little smile that was bright enough to brighten up the darkest of days
4480952 when i am alone i cry for abbie and i sing the song i did when she couldnt sleep

4480963 if meadowbank hadnt existed there is no question that i wouldnt be where i am today or craig maclean for that matter
4480964 my big concern is that once glasgow is built meadowbank will be demolished and the chance to keep the edinburgh racers club going will be in jeopardy
4480965 without the grassroots introduction to the sport there will be a whole generation of kids that wont have the opportunity to try out track cycling and one or two could have gone on to become olympic or world champions
4480966 and to expect a kid of 12 who is just trying out cycling for fun to get his parents to take him through to glasgow and back twice a week is unlikely todays elite riders will travel but what about the future champions
4480967 the future of the sport depends on there being a facility and i fear for the future of scottish cycling there is expertise in edinburgh thats been built up over 40 years and that will all be lost if meadowbank isnt replaced but it is politicians and not sportspeople who make these decisions and sometimes it is a shame that we do not have more of a voice
4480968 edinburgh should honour his achievements by providing and enhancing track cycling facilities in the capital
4480969 the important role that the velodrome at meadowbank stadium played in chris hoys development as a track cyclist
4480970 that without the provision of a track cycling facility in the city many would lose the opportunity of involvement in one of scotlands most successful sports

4480991 during that timeframe the cheapest you could get gas anywhere around here was 4 28
4480992 its not the local owners that are charging this but at a distribution level something is wrong when youre paying 20 cents a gallon more at a mobil in tupper lake or saranac lake or lake placid than just 40 miles up the road

4481022 i didnt think about the streak until i started walking back on the mound
4481023 the first thought that popped in my head was i cant believe that just happened with a runner on first but i guess the good thing is it wasnt a cheap one it was hit hard and was the first extra base hit ive given up a whole bunch of things fell at once and so that way theres no pressure from this point on just go out and pitch

4481034 were thrilled james decided to come back for the episodes its like a mcqueen family reunion on set but under very different circumstances john pauls presence is simply the icing on the cake
4481035 the cast and crew are currently filming on location for a number of huge episodes and were sure that the storylines twists and consequences will definitely come as a shock to viewers
4481036 de blob was the eye opener for us that we can make cool games and function as a good team the game definitely gave us the opportunity to start our own company
4481037 we always dreamed of designing an rts and when wii ware came out we immediately figured that this was our chance
4481038 id have responded to that because theyd have been owning the request
4481039 there were very mixed views about the alternative to howard namely peter costello
4481040 in the end we decided that unless the pm would say that he had decided to stand down then there would be no change
4481041 he spent 30 minutes telling me why peter couldnt win he had more show of winning than peter
4481042 i found none of it compelling i spent 30 minutes putting my case and he spent 30 minutes responding
4481043 if my senior colleagues were as a group prepared to own a request for me to go id have gone
4481044 but i was not going to out of the blue go because i didnt think that would have produced a different result and that i would have rightly been criticised for cowardice
4481045 as the election campaign wore on the departure was getting further and further extended
4481046 what other answer could i have given oh no no i cant beat him again i mean ridiculous
4481047 youd have to ask him whether he accepted it not well he didnt
4481048 could have easily said one term two terms one and a half terms
4481049 i certainly would have given a clear indication to him that if i became prime minister i wasnt going to stay forever
4481050 in 2005 time placed watchmen on its list of the 100 greatest english language novels from 1923 to the present

4481054 in rugby we dont penalise players for mistakes like that kinene is currently sitting his electrical engineering exams at kyambogo university and its the only reason he wont be travelling with us
4481055 weve had some good discussions and were close to finalising a deal
4481056 were not prepared to speculate on the details but were confident that we can finalise the details over the weekend
4481057 its important for people to know that he williams and toulon contacted us
4481058 we havent gone chasing any of this we were prepared to take the matter to court and make him accountable and still are if an agreement is not reached
4481059 a financial settlement is going to be found at the beginning of next week
4481060 the fact he has decided not to defy the injunction sends a clear message to people who want to break their contract
4481061 how long he stays on the sidelines is one of the issues that has been raised
4481062 ive said on a few occasions that the issue is that not only does his departure impact on us on the field but also off the field
4481063 an impact across the whole business current and future players supporters sponsors we need to take all that into account on the next range of discussions with toulon
4481064 if we are not complaining about the poor showing of our athletes its about the sorry state of administration of many a codes or infighting for positions im sure were all agreed that this state of affairs is no manner in which to build a winning nation
4481065 its our hope that the bulk of those funds are invested in the developmental aspects of the codes we support which coincidently are all the major sport codes in namibia we might not support every sporting code but in concert with the namibian government and other private sector players we should be able to ensure that namibia sport takes centre stage amongst the best performing nations in the world
4481066 we need medals and trophies as part of our national sporting heritage for posterity to behold as their treasures of value

4481102 it is going to be tough playing against richie he is a good player
4481103 but at the end of the day all 15 guys have to buy into being competitive at the breakdown it is not only down to me it starts with the pack of forwards but all 15 guys have a responsibility to clean out well and be competitive at the breakdown
4481104 i always look forward to playing against richie it is one of the reasons why i play rugby
4481105 in a game like this to play against a guy that is as good as he is it is always good to measure yourself against them he is one of the best so it is going to be a tough one
4481106 mccaw is a fantastic player but apart from that he adds a hell of a lot to them with his leadership it is quite similar to john smit with our side he had a big input in their last game so it is going to be tough
4481107 nowadays i am watching way too much test rugby it is never fun to miss out on test matches but thankfully this time it was only one week and i am back this week
4481108 i am not too sure that not having played much rugby this year is a blessing in disguise i played a lot of rugby last year and obviously this year i havent played much so i dont know if it is a good thing or a bad thing when you dont play a lot of rugby you are not as comfortable sometimes but i am feeling pretty confident for saturday
4481109 with the boks having won in dunedin it has certainly added a bit of spice to the game both sides really want to win this match so that is always good and it will be a proper contest
4481110 every game against the all blacks is special it is always special to be a part of big matches like this there is a big build up and great vibe around the game so you just want to get out there and play some rugby
4481111 big test matches like this are always 50 50 they will be tough to beat they showed when they were under tremendous pressure against australia and they managed to produce on the day it is always great to play to a full house at newlands it is my home ground and it will be so much more special if we can pull off a win hopefully we can have a bit of luck and get a win

4481156 back in the reagan years the national endowment for democracy was created as a cold war tool today the ned is a neocon controlled agent for us world hegemony its main function is to pour us money and election rigging into former constituent parts of the soviet union in order to ring russia with american puppet states
4481157 the neoconservative bush regime used the ned to intervene in ukrainian and georgian internal affairs in keeping with the neoconservative plan to establish us friendly and russia hostile political regimes in these two former constituent parts of russia and the soviet union
4481158 during the late 1970s there was new thinking at the highest levels of the u s foreign policymakers and they reconsidered whether these ugly murderous military dictatorships of the 1970s were really the best way to preserve u s interests in these countries
4481159 this new thinking led to the establishment in 1983 of the national endowment for democracy they had chosen the german pattern in which the major political parties in germany have foundations financed by the federal government they did more or less the same thing with the establishment of the ned as a private foundation there is really nothing private about it and all its money comes from the congress
4481160 a lot of what we ned do today was done covertly 25 years ago by the cia

4481162 the place that has suffered most is south ossetia which is home to both ethnic ossetians and georgians the latter accounting for about a third of the population
4481163 ossetians fleeing the conflict zone talk of georgian atrocities and the indiscriminate killing of civilians
4481164 on august 7 after days of shooting incidents in the south ossetian conflict zone georgian president mikheil saakashvili made a speech in which he said that he had given the georgian villagers orders not to fire that he wanted to offer south ossetia unlimited autonomy within the georgian state with russia to be a guarantor of the arrangement
4481165 both sides said they were discussing a meeting the next day to discuss how to defuse the clashes
4481166 that evening however saakashvili went for the military option the georgian military launched a massive artillery attack on tskhinvali followed the next day by a ground assault involving tanks
4481167 this was a city with no pure military targets full of civilians who had been given no warning and were expecting peace talks at any moment
4481168 the attack looked designed to take everybody by surprise perhaps because much of the russian leadership was in beijing for the opening of the olympic games it also unilaterally destroyed the negotiating and peacekeeping arrangements under the aegis of the organization for security and cooperation in europe that have been in place for 16 years russian peacekeeping troops based in south ossetia were among those killed in the georgian assault
4481169 many had traveled in their nightclothes on rocky roads through the mountains and gave bloodcurdling accounts of georgian atrocities i came in the boot of a car georgian snipers were firing at us from the forest my brother stayed to fight our grandparents home was reduced to rubble we dont know where they are nothing is left of their village it was totally destroyed by rockets and tank fire alisa mamiyeva 26 a teacher in tskhinvali said from the safety of vladikavkaz in north ossetia
4481170 russia failed to back up its claims of georgian atrocities
4481171 coverage in the u s and europe is leaning heavily toward reports on the georgian casualties of russian bombing over the weekend few details are being given about the thousands said to have been killed when georgia attacked tskhinvali the capital of south ossetia on thursday and friday
4481172 the figure of 2 000 people killed is very doubtful our findings so far do not in any way confirm the russian statistics on the contrary they suggest the numbers are exaggerated
4481173 one woman told how a family of four including two children tried to flee from a georgian tank but it fired on their car and they were all burned to death said angela who like all the refugees only gave her first name
4481174 she saw the georgian tanks roll into tskhinvali the soldiers shouting hail saakashvili who is the president of georgia they destroyed the city added inna 33 who said she could not understand how the georgian troops could do that to civilians
4481175 you see your friends home burning and theres nothing you can do you just watch and cry its a genocide inna said an old woman among the refugees said all she had left was the dress she was wearing my house is destroyed she said

4481184 mr granthams study of bubbles suggests that it takes them about as long to deflate as it did to inflate he says the standard amp poors 500 stock index could fall more than an additional 20 from its current level
4481185 i suspect that 2003 will end up being the fourth consecutive down year for the first time since 1932
4481186 after a huge stock bubble burst the stock market historically has pursued a painful and predictable path this time it hasnt quite followed the script and that is making some stock analysts nervous if mr grantham is right the current rally is a fools paradise the prelude to a deadening decline that he calls the end of the world he says it could begin late this year and stocks could fall even further than in 2002

4481196 if someone continues to attack our citizens our peacekeepers we will of course respond in just the same way we have responded there should be no doubt about this
4481197 unfortunately after what has happened it is unlikely that the ossetians and the abkhazians will be able to live in one state together with the georgians
4481198 this decision clearly demonstrates everything we have said recently the deployment of new anti missile forces has as its aim the russian federation

4481203 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
4481204 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
4481205 in a sense its economically viable for them to skirt the law and wait to see if they get sued because the exposure is not that huge
4481206 if they can settle a complaint for less than 100 percent of what they owe people for overtime theyve gotten away with a good deal its almost worthwhile to break the law the way its set up

4481238 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state

4481282 i started searching for a memory in memory of my late mother in law who had been estranged from my husband for 34 years i found her 11 months before she died and thought as a tribute to her i would continue tracing to help other people find their loved ones over the years i would like to think i have had a great deal of success i have used various resources during this time and through a recommendation from a friend began to use tracesmart for their excellent facility there is no better search facility available online
4481283 due to the synergy that exists our relationship has flourished over the past 6 months and tracesmart are proud to be sponsoring such a worthy voluntary tracing service the team that gill leads is dedicated to assisting those who contact them hoping to find their missing person together with their knowledge of family history and unlimited access to tracesmarts services and products gill and her team will be able to facilitate even more people
4481284 there are a lot of background talks going on whereby a way is trying to be found so that there is no impeachment
4481285 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4481286 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4481287 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4481288 these unsubstantiated spate of reports are totally baseless and malicious
4481289 once they issue impeachment proceedings against him and issue a charge sheet then it will become almost inevitable that he will want to answer those charges
4481290 he feels very strongly that a lot of that is being said is not correct
4481291 we have conveyed to them that the coalition is determined for impeachment and if he wants to save himself the best way is for him to quit
4481292 if a person moves to the side we are not in the habit of bothering him this would not be a good attitude if someone is lying on the ground and we go aggressively against him

4481315 todos estamos de acuerdo en que hay que preservar las fuentes de trabajo en que hay que mejorar el sistema aerocomercial y seguir teniendo una l nea de bandera pero lo que tambi n queremos todos es conocer los n meros del pasivo y de los activos
4481316 el estado no puede hacerse cargo de cada uno de los malos manejos de las empresas privadas

4481322 puede ser que alguno haya ganado con el diferencial de cambio pero el verdadero negocio son los dep sitos salvo que huelan sangre pero no era el caso
4481323 la demanda de dinero la reconstru s subiendo la tasa de inter s y poniendo los d lares

4481335 several days ago a majority of the us house of representatives approved a resolution apologizing for slavery the senate has not yet moved on such a measure and probably has no intention to do so
4481336 the number of persons engaged in the slave trade and the amount of capital embarked on it exceed our powers of calculation the city of new york has been until of late 1862 the principal port of the world for this infamous trade
4481337 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at rhonda she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her she smiled at him and told him dont leave me im waiting for you to come back he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired
4481338 they tried to resuscitate him two times one time he came back for about an hour then he went into cardiac arrest the second time
4481339 he told his wife non verbally that he could breathe on his own and he wanted the ventilator out he motioned that he wanted it out
4481340 but because he had it his immune system was compromised he had an infection he was on a new medication that suppresses the immune system and thats where the pneumonia came from
4481341 he was critically ill when he was in the hospital
4481342 shes devastated however shes at peace about his transition because of her faith in god her faith is what is sustaining her
4481343 they had 30 years of marriage thats unprecedented in todays time particularly for celebrities that brings joy to her they loved each other and respected each other on a daily basis she was by his side to the very end
4481344 when they started dating he said girl you better come on board this train because im going to be rich and her response was okay and they were married thats how he charmed her with his sense of humor
4481345 when they got married they were kids he was 20 and she was 19 they both grew up together and they both matured in this marriage
4481346 what she will treasure the most is the fact that she was his wife for 30 years and not only was she his wife but she was his best friend shes going to miss him dearly

4481360 there were enormous complexities and there are some loose ends that we have not nailed down we have figured out most of the solutions however
4481361 weve made enough progress on our system issues to begin shipping from some of our distribution centers today and will continue to work though the night to have shipments available to run all distribution centers tomorrow
4481362 i probably wouldnt have noticed if they hadnt informed me
4481363 this time the sites been up but our shipping system is down its worse than it was in march were really backlogged
4481364 these costs could be offset by savings elsewhere either by buying less streaming content or spending less on marketing

4481394 technology providers that demonstrate the greatest degree of support for b2b and b2c internet sales
4481395 these providers lead the market in e commerce by consistently demonstrating customer satisfaction strong support and professional services leading to the implementation of a successful e commerce site
4481396 demonstrated longevity in the e commerce market as well as a commitment to new product innovations for internet sales in addition leaders represent technology providers with the strongest capability to meet internet selling requirements
4481397 the world of e commerce has gone through several major transformations over the past decade and weve always tried to keep our clients ahead of the competition
4481398 websphere commerce provides retailers with a wide range of features and capabilities to help sell goods and services through various channels to an increasingly global and mobile marketplace
4481399 we knew we could vastly improve the customer experience by deploying an online booking application to enhance our existing web site ibm came in and really pulled the project together in an amazingly short period of time five months compressing a development cycle that was slated to take 12 months
4481400 when customers book a tour the application is simultaneously booking reservations for hotels buses and so on
4481401 we needed our online system to extend the complexities built into our core business systems out to the web without making the process too complicated for our customers the websphere commerce solution did this without having to completely rewrite our back end systems
4481402 this project is a great example of how ibm is helping clients adapt to constantly changing conditions such as rising fuel costs and new terms of engagement between airlines and travel agencies
4481403 using ibm software and soa companies like vantage can make it easier and less expensive for consumers to book vacations while reducing the time and money it takes to manage a complex business and web site like this
4481404 i had confronted the youths to get an explanation because one of them had thrown a brick at my car
4481405 as a result i was punched in the head fell to the floor and they continued to hit me
4481406 at one point i felt a sharp pain to my head it was a frightening experience
4481407 this was a cowardly attack on an innocent man by a local group of immature youths
4481408 this kind of violent behaviour is totally unacceptable and it will not be tolerated by the police or the local community

4481435 by no means clear that the house of laity would support legis la tion whose inevitable consequences would be the exclusion of faithful anglicans from the church of england
4481436 not a necessary conclusion we are being encouraged by friends in other historic churches to con tinue to struggle for the catholic identity of the church of england
4481437 it is essential that we behave with grace and charity towards everyone
4481438 remember too that some speeches in the general synod and reactions since have shown us that there are many people including bishops who do not agree with us about women bishops but do not want to see the marginalisation or ex clusion of our contribution from the ongoing life of the church of england
4481439 that has serious im plica tions for lots of people includ ing us
4481440 as a whole constituency not just forward in faith we have al ways made it quite clear that juris diction is not our top line its our bottom line there is a kind of na ve stupidity about that it is a nego tiating ploy but it is not nothing else will do that view is shared by all 14 bishops
4481441 i dont think i have ever known an atmosphere like there was in york a wilful disregard for fellow chris tians
4481442 if the bishops show they are willing to deal with it themselves and take it back it can be redeemed but im not over optimistic
4481443 the protestant low church teachings the liberal experiential teachings are just not true their italics the catholic faith the catholic practice the catholic teaching is true
4481444 what was not pos sible 20 years ago may be possible to day
4481445 what arcic was asking for was unity with rome and remaining anglicans
4481446 the anglican church has taken a distinctively protestant sectarian move the question jack is asking is can part of the anglican com munion do what the whole com munion was going to do
4481447 i felt i had been ungra cious however since it has emerged that at least two of the bishops op posed to the ordination of women to the episcopate voted against the amend ment because it did not pro vide sufficient assurances i have felt that i had been right after all

4481499 the more liberal camp just assumes that pastor warren is going to make this a christian litmus test of the presidency others who are more conservative fear he is going to wimp out on some of the issues
4481500 he says neither group understands or knows me hes going to ask tough questions fair questions not gotcha questions
4481501 its a great way for him to do what he can to make connections with not only moderate evangelicals but also the many people out there who read the purpose driven life

4481503 the god strategy how religion became a political weapon in america
4481504 obama is going to make real inroads for people who want to be satisfied that this is a pretty religious guy but that hes not a lunatic
4481505 features a long look at republican presidential candidate john mccains religious views with extensive comments from the candidate himself
4481506 a top strategist for sen john mccains campaign said thursday that the presidential contest in virginia will undoubtedly be close this fall and acknowledged that the state should no longer be considered a republican stronghold

4481508 several pols rumored to be on the prospective running mate list sens evan bayh of indiana joe biden of delaware and to a lesser extent gov bill richardson of new mexico

4481510 mccain is expected to speak to the group numbering 10 000 or more on monday with obama due in town the next day a vfw official confirmed their appearances adding that president bush had been invited as well
4481511 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4481512 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4481513 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4481514 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4481515 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4481516 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4481517 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4481518 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4481519 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4481520 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4481521 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4481522 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4481523 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4481524 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4481525 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4481526 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4481527 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4481528 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4481529 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4481530 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4481531 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4481532 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4481533 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4481534 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4481535 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4481536 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4481537 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4481538 alla v lkomnades inte av fatah ledaren mahmoud abbas och han kr vde till en b rjan att flera dussin av fatah m nnen f rdes tillbaka till gazaremsan f r att markera att de m sta h lla st nd mot hamas och att fatah
4481539 situationen r s ironisk att den trotsar allt f rnuft n r israels statsminister jitzchak rabin f rsvarade osloavtalet 1993 inf r en n got skeptisk israelisk allm nhet sade han att han sl t avtalet med fatah och plo ledaren yassir arafat d rf r att arafat skulle bek mpa hamas p ett effektivare s tt n israel
4481540 rabin och de vriga israeliska ledarna den g ngen trodde att en arafat utan h mskor och utan kontroll via hd och andra liknande inbyggda demokratiska institutioner skulle kunna st emot hamas och mana fram en best ende fred med israel
4481541 men som det skulle visa sig 15 r senare lyckades en annan organisation i israel f r medborgerliga r ttigheter med en petition till hd framg ngsrikt r dda anh ngare av
4481542 men hans korrupta env lde ledde ju bara till ett f rdjupat f rakt bland folket hamas valseger ver fatah i jaunari 2006 bottnade mer i vanstyret inom fatah plo n i det islamiska uppvaknandet i hamas regi och valsegern handlade inte alls om den korsynta och ensidiga israeliska retr tten fr n gazaremsan r 2005 i st llet f r att koppla ihop tillbakadragandet fr n remsan med liknande steg fr n palestinsk sida man kunde exempelvis ha b rjat bygga bort alla de palestinska flyktingl gren i gazaremsan och ersatt dem med dr gligare hem i nya bostadskvarter bidrog israels tillbakadragande till att st rka extremismen bland palestinierna
4481543 den s kallade fredskonferensen i annapolis i november ifjol fortsatte denna missriktade politik
4481544 palestinierna har f tt lida stort p grund av den bristande demokratin som ju i realiteten satts helt p undantag b de p v stbanken och i gazaremsan
4481545 sedan b rjan av den andra intifadan i september 2 000 har inb rdes striderna bland palestinierna n tt oanade h jder
4481546 vart tog pengarna v gen som skulle ha investerats f r att reformera hela det palestinska r ttssystemet varf r reagerar man inte p det internationella planet med avsky n r de palestinska ledarna drar ner hela det palestinska samh llet i avgrunden
4481547 men n r den intellektuella hederligheten kr vde att han eid vervakade ocks de palestinska vergreppen p samma s tt intresserade sig ingen p det internationella planet f r s dana rapporter

4481555 after a looong drawn out battle the recording industry paid tanya andersens lawyers fees
4481556 i wrote about her case this spring the riaa sued her for copyright infringement but finally dropped the case after andersen spent two years defending herself in court shes since sued them under conspiracy laws and is trying to get class action status
4481557 the newest development surrounding the long lasting case of one tanya andersen and the recording industry association of america riaa sees the single mother turning the tables on the riaa countersuing and winning fearing the worst the riaa offered andersen a 30 000 settlement which she refused then upped it 60 000 to the same effect before being ordered to pay nearly 108 000 by a judge and setting a precedent andersen and her laywers lory lybeck and ben justus have opened the door in their efforts for more countersuits against the riaa which has been accused of bullying alleged illegal downloaders of copyrighted content into paying settlements to get rid of the lawsuits the riaa slapped on them andersens successful countersuit for the riaas frivolous lawsuit has earned her a court ordered payment of 107 951 03 including 117 03 of interest in attorneys fees
4481558 with a number of key losses have the riaa reeling
4481559 the judge had little sympathy for the riaas tactics and wastefulness of the courts time
4481560 the riaa sued a single mother from oregon for sharing copyrighted music files on her broadband connection
4481561 unfortunately for the riaa they couldnt actually prove she did anything wrong so they were forced to drop the case a judge ultimately ruled that the riaa had to pay the womans court fees of 107 951 after initially trying to get away with paying just 30 000 and then 60 000 the riaa has finally paid andersen the full amount andersen is still suing the music industry for violating racketeering laws

4481612 my landlord has told me to vacate the house because i indicated to him that there was no way i could raise the foreign currency to buy the fuel coupons houses to rent are difficult to get these days and that means that my four children wife and i might end up living in the open if we fail to secure alternative lodgings
4481613 as it is i am struggling to keep the children in school we barely have enough food and i need to settle a huge bill after my wife stayed for two weeks in hospital where she was operated on for breast cancer god knows where on earth i would raise that kind of money
4481614 we have seen many property owners arrested for charging rent in foreign currency but there is no law that i am aware of that stipulates that a landlord cannot ask for fuel coupons so that way we are able to dodge the law while at the same time getting our rent in a form that enables us to keep our money stable
4481615 because that would leave me with the burden of having to go out onto the streets to sell it again
4481616 fuel coupons are now firmly a form of currency in a country whose people will stop at nothing to ensure that they are protected against a hyperinflationary environment
4481617 like foreign currency the value of the coupons does not change even if kept for a long time and that way service providers realise that they are able keep their money in a stable form
4481618 in other words coupons are a replacement for foreign currency and insistence on their usage by those who offer services or sell products amply indicates the level to which our economy has dollarised
4481619 clever type of barter trade now the norm countrywide in an economy where the local currency is not worth much

4481622 i think that the coverage of the text is excellent it carves out a seriously neglected area and it very thoroughly covers the topic the authors are very knowledgeable concerning the literature this is an excellent text that provides a detailed yet comprehensible account of how to estimate test and probe interactions in regression models
4481623 leona s aiken and stephen g west do an excellent job of structuring testing and interpreting multiple regression models containing interactions curvilinear effects or a combination of both procedures for testing and graphical displays of interactions between categorical variables have been done for years but none seems to have provided a comprehensive treatment or guideline for the analysis of interactions between continuous variables aiken and west however address those issues quite effectively and thoroughly an aid to any graduate and or researcher in their analysis of continuous variables highly recommended for graduate libraries
4481624 the book would serve very well as a reference for applied researchers and methodologists in particular this would be an excellent reference for anyone who encounters a multivariable prediction problem and has reason to believe that either a nonlinear model or a model including a variable product term would be appropriate

4481626 how has george bush reacted to the hell he created in iraq to the thousands of lives that have been lost in the war and to the enormous and endless suffering that the survivors of the victims their loved ones have had to endure
4481627 not only because the words he has uttered could never have escaped from his lips if he were suffering but because no matter how many american soldiers have died on a given day in iraq averaging well over two every day he is always seen with a big smile on his face that same day or the next and is in good spirits

4481667 discovery its a hoax its a halloween costume in a box
4481668 theres a whole number of things that raise red flags in my opinion
4481669 we started to tell people the week after we found the body but no on believed us
4481670 so we started to make fun of the bigfoot trackers and that got attention
4481671 you type in bigfoot and thats the name that comes up
4481672 be still my heart i felt bad for the poor thing
4481673 after being in the industry for the past 30 years i wondered was it diseased did it die of old age
4481674 if the guy claims to have a body he really should produce one
4481675 unfortunately this kind of incident simply just casts further aspersion on the topic
4481676 theres always an interest in these creatures dating back hundreds of years mermaids unicorns dragons
4481677 there isnt a populated place on earth that doesnt have these kinds of creatures
4481678 i accept or deny evidence based upon the evidence we have about bigfoot 80 percent is proof and 20 percent is myth
4481679 99 percent a hoax and 1 percent a probability of reality
4481680 pastor triplett my man would never abandon me if i get pregnant he loves me too much

4481683 i need that like i need teeth in my asshole
4481684 you didnt know what you were doing honey you were in shock
4481685 when i first met my wife i believed that i was supposed to be married
4481686 i thought if i wanted to be happy i needed to be married and once i was married my life would be whole and complete forever
4481687 we think if we get a relationship it will give us direction self marriage is about creating a credo about who you are and whats important in your life it creates a standard to operate from
4481688 jesus is in your neighborhood you just gotta keep the faith and wait on god he might be 3 4 houses down but hes in your neighborhood he might maybe be 4 5 weeks away but hes in your neighborhood hold oooonnnn just a little while longerrr

4481690 i hadnt realized how much my chemistry with him since titanic would still stick
4481691 its great to discover we can just slip right into it like muscle memory
4481692 i will admit it was quite bizarre to direct my wife in how to make love but its difficult whether youre married to a person or not
4481693 the other hotels around the area all have health care that is provided by the boss and have been able to get wage increases
4481694 at the other hotels in the same classification for the same work the workers get paid 2 to 3 an hour more
4481695 clearly were disappointed that unite here local 681 has spent more time protesting
4481696 publicity stunts are not productive and are extremely disruptive to the resort district
4481697 disneyland is being unfair with us because were fighting for our health care and theyre trying to take it away
4481698 theyre trying to cut our hours and take away our seniority
4481699 the most important is health care we need that and they want to take it away
4481700 at the end of the day what it means is that workers are going to be priced out of health care

4481703 we strongly believe that success for windows 7 includes an open and honest and two way discussion about how we balance all of these interests and deliver software on the scale of windows we promise and will deliver such a dialog with this blog
4481704 in leading up to this blog we have seen a lot of discussion in blogs about what microsoft might be trying to accomplish by maintaining a little bit more control over the communication around windows 7 some might say that this is a significant understatement
4481705 we will make sure that members of the windows 7 development team represent themselves as such as well

4481710 la existencia aqu es dura pero estamos acostumbrados es parte de nuestra cultura a mi no me gusta estar en los campamentos de refugiados de argelia ni en las zonas ocupadas por marruecos vivir libre a pesar de las dificultades es lo mejor
4481711 desde aqu pod is observar los tanques los soldados y a veces sus aeronaves es una amenaza constante pero esta es mi tierra y de aqu no me van a echar
4481712 los restos del lucrativo negocio de las armas se encuentran por todas partes y lamentablemente muchos de los pa ses con responsabilidades hist ricas que pretenden mostrarse como mediadores neutrales se ven directamente involucrados en el desproporcionado rearme del ej rcito ocupante
4481713 obviamente este es el caso de espa a y francia
4481714 al pueblo saharaui no lo ha organizado ni las agencias de ayuda humanitaria de las naciones unidas ni ning n gobierno u ong fueron ellos mismos quienes mostraron una incre ble capacidad para crear estructuras en medio de la nada las mujeres mostraron una fortaleza y determinaci n decisiva que perdura hasta nuestros d as
4481715 se trata de una medida temporal pues para ellos es importante recordar que todo esto se realiz siempre con la idea de regresar a su tierra
4481716 es que la gente solo visualiza los campamentos de refugiados de tindouf y no sabe que ya existe un territorio liberado adem s del ocupado
4481717 el sahara occidental tiene cientos de kil metros de playas y mar ciudades y minas muy ricas no es un p ramo como a veces se da a entender
4481718 la gente en los territorios ocupados lo pasa muy mal los activistas pro derechos humanos son torturados desaparecidos y encarcelados si hubiese una orden pol tica de acudir en su auxilio la acatar a ahora mismo
4481719 aparentemente la milicia del polisario cuenta con un material militar que dif cilmente podr a contrarrestar la capacidad ofensiva de la dictadura marroqu pero esto mismo se pens en los setenta y la sorpresa fue que aguantamos y golpeamos durante mas de quince a os hasta el d a de hoy la voluntad de un pueblo es su mejor arma
4481720 aqu lo que hay es un claro intercambio entre espa a y marruecos si marruecos contiene la emigraci n ilegal espa a se calla sobre el sahara si espa a les vende tanques marruecos les deja el banco pesquero saharaui y as con la droga el terrorismo isl mico etc que me perdonen pero es la verdad
4481721 pero para nosotros lo mas doloroso es lo del psoe desde que felipe gonz lez vino aqu en los setenta hablando sobre nuestro derecho a la autodeterminaci n hasta la actualidad con moratinos hemos recibido una pu alada por la espalda tras otra al menos con en el pp sabemos que no tenemos nada
4481722 la mejor a y la buena vecindad que el pp nunca tuvo con marruecos
4481723 no significan mas que la venta de carros blindados m 60 el apoyo diplom tico a la dictadura mon rquica y la explotaci n ilegitima de su banco pesquero por parte de la flota espa ola
4481724 es como poner tiritas a un herido que se est desangrando
4481725 aqu cada observador de la onu tiene un veh culo nuevo un sueldo de ocho mil euros al mes los mejores hoteles helic pteros y todo para que qu observan cu ndo nos ayudan somos arrestados y torturados de manera sistem tica y ellos no hacen mas que mirar para otro lado
4481726 la represi n ha aprendido de nuevas formas de tortura menos obvias pero igual de terror ficas como son la ba era la bolsa y el pollo
4481727 los traen en camiones y autobuses desde las zonas mas deprimidas del reino llegan exhaustos y los dejan tirados a su suerte en la costa aunque ellos no sufren la violencia sistem tica que nosotros soportamos tambi n ellos son maltratados por el r gimen absolutista nuestra lucha no es contra el pueblo marroqu sino contra el rey mohamed vi y sus militares corruptos
4481728 lo est n empezando a hacer con los activistas mas valientes que como suele suceder muy a menudo son los mas j venes los violan y despu s los dejan abandonados en el desierto eso para la dignidad del saharaui es algo muy duro
4481729 eso es un infierno al que la onu no presta ninguna atenci n all se cometen cientos de abusos de los derechos humanos adem s de desapariciones forzadas hay mucha gente que ha sido arrestada y no se le ha vuelto a ver
4481730 quieren perder tiempo y asimilarnos que nos disolvamos en marruecos al igual que en otros conflictos el tiempo siempre juega a favor del ocupante aqu por ejemplo ya hay una especie de junta de saharauis pro marroqu es que viven muy bien es triste reconocerlo pero empiezan a ser muchos los que no han aguantado y se han vendido
4481731 incluso en el caso de que acept semos la falsa autonom a impuesta por rabat no vivir amos en un estado de derecho pues el marco de una monarqu a absolutista no es garante de nada aqu es hasta ilegal cuestionar de manera pacifica la integridad territorial qu futuro nos espera en un pa s as
4481732 marruecos no quiere un refer ndum de ninguna forma nosotros hemos aceptado incluso que todos los marroqu es que vinieron aqu antes de 1999 puedan votar pero ni a n as quieren permitirnos autodeterminarnos
4481733 las madres las estudiantes y las hijas nos organizamos junto con nuestros compa eros en la mas absoluta clandestinidad
4481734 y por supuesto tambi n sufrimos las palizas o los golpes de la polic a en nuestras manifestaciones no se vaya a pensar que por ser mujeres nos pegan menos
4481735 grabamos nuestras acciones y las colgamos en internet tenemos la esperanza de que la gente nos vea resistir y se sume a nuestras reivindicaciones democr ticas all en europa les importa mucho la democracia verdad

4481751 if you worked on the atlantic freighter and worked for marine atlantic and you now show signs of asbestos exposure they will open a claim for you no questions asked
4481752 where in this case marine atlantic has stepped forward and accepted responsibility for the asbestos exposure compensation boards are not going to question it

4481768 i stand on the first tee and i just feel comfortable

4481875 we wanted to make the final and to be the first team to do it is unbelievable

4481889 the level of growth of repossession orders suggests that we are on track for a repossession crisis very similar to the early 1990s
4481890 it is absolutely vital that the government should intervene and require a proper code of conduct to be implemented by mortgage lenders
4481891 this should not just apply to the big banks but to the large number of secondary lenders who are using court action to pursue their debts in a very aggressive way
4481892 the council for mortgage lenders code of conduct should be put on a statutory footing for all repossession actions
4481893 he betrayed families by claiming hed abolished boom and bust and encouraging a spend now pay later culture
4481894 now times are getting tougher thousands are losing their homes because they can no longer make ends meet
4481895 lenders must now act responsibly even if our prime minister has not done so to minimise the number of people losing their homes
4481896 whilst we are not seeing repossessions on the same scale as the early 1990s we are making sure the right advice and support is available for the minority of borrowers who may need it at the moment because of global economic pressures
4481897 as well as expanding free legal representation in county courts for households at risk of repossession we are providing more free debt advice and are working closely with lenders to ensure that repossession is only ever a last resort
4481898 these services can make a real difference with more than 80 of repossessions avoided when they are used it is important that families who have concerns seek advice at the earliest opportunity starting by speaking to their lender

4481900 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4481901 if i may be so bold there was another president
4481902 at one time there was a president named ronald reagan who spoke very strongly about americas advocacy for democracy and freedom
4481903 we are still entitled to play the group of players born in 1986 but we have decided to go with the younger group as part of the build up to the next campaign a lot of these players have been involved before so i expect it should be a smooth transition

4481912 it is disappointing that the issues with this years national curriculum test results have meant that the partnership between qca and ets europe must end early
4481913 let me sum up on track stay the course a thousand points of light
4481914 a huge number of people suffer from allergies and while hay fever for example is generally not life threatening allergy sufferers often also have asthma which can be deadly
4481915 we used a speech stressor test used in a lot of psychology research
4481916 basically the participants each appeared before a panel of several evaluators who supposedly were behavioral experts participants had to give a 10 minute speech which was videotaped and then are asked a series of math questions they had to solve without paper or pen
4481917 the whole exercise is a nice stress experiment in the laboratory
4481918 the wheals on a person who was moderately anxious because of the experiment were 75 percent larger after the experiment compared to that same persons response on the day when they were not stressed
4481919 but people who were highly anxious had wheals that were twice as big after they were stressed compared to their response when they were not stressed moreover these same people were four times more likely to have a stronger reaction to the skin test one day later after the stress
4481920 late phase reactions also occur in allergic asthma and can in the proper settings be potentially life threatening
4481921 the results of this study should alert practitioners and patients alike to the adverse effects of stress on allergic reactions in the nose chest skin and other organs that may seemingly resolve within a few minutes to hours after starting but may reappear the nest day when least expected
4481922 whats interesting about this is that it shows that being stressed can cause a persons allergies to worsen the next day
4481923 this is clinically important for patients since most of what we do to treat allergies is to take antihistimines to control the symptoms runny nose watery itchy eyes and congestion
4481924 antihistimines dont deal with those symptoms on the next day people may be setting themselves up to have more persistent problems by being stressed and anxious when allergy attacks begin

4481927 are both committed to winning back the white house and to ensuring that the voices of all 35 million people who participated in this historic primary election are respected and heard in denver
4481928 to honor and celebrate these voices and votes both sen obamas and sen clintons names will be placed in nomination
4481929 this wasnt something she was itching for looking for but so many of her supporters said it was important to them and the obama people got how important it was to smooth over any tensions and that it was the right thing to do
4481930 i am convinced that honoring sen clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4481931 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect sen obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again

4481960 i get blamed for everything for global warming to high petrol prices but in this case i want to be very clear since i talked to martin oneill about the situation in april i have not talked to anyone at aston villa
4481961 i will try to be very clear over the barry situation everyone has been talking and it seems that the blame is put on me
4481962 all the talks have been between our chief executive rick parry the owner and the chief executive of aston villa and those talks have all been pretty good
4481963 so if anyone wants to talk about barry in the future they must talk with the owner rick parry or the chief executive of aston villa and as i have said those talks i understand have been good
4481964 i was not involved in the talks about barry i was not involved in the talks about xabi alonso and arsenal if you want to talk about these players you must talk to the chief executive of our club who was handling the discussions

4481974 were looking at the citys probably most important capital asset and probably the single biggest factor in its economy in terms of getting workers and students and tourists around
4481975 we have budgeted that amount for the cost of policing the subway
4481976 if new york city were not to do that it would be a cost that would have to be borne by the m t a
4481977 if anything thats better because it creates a dedicated revenue stream and takes transit funding out of the annual budget process and takes it away from competing against public housing or parks or hospitals or other valuable government activities

4482111 de aex zit nu al anderhalve week in deze bandbreedte en beweegt niet veel die 400 punten vormen een bodem terwijl die 418 punten een stevige weerstand zijn mocht de aex door de 400 punten zakken dan kan de graadmeter flink wegzakken als de aex door de weerstand van 418 punten breekt ligt er een volgende barri re op 440 punten
4482112 ik denk dan ook dat de aex eerder door de 400 punten zakt dan dat de index een aanval op de 418 punten gaat doen

4482193 and i thank you too for what youre doing to protect floridas beautiful environment its incredibly critical for the future of florida and the country

4482202 in fact speculative non commercial trading accounted for nearly half of the oil trading on the new york mercantile exchange

4482205 appears to have been created and released to influence that senate vote which would be highly improper in our view
4482206 it will be appealed it doesnt mean anything what really matters is what the last ruling is not the first
4482207 i think its a lot of vindication for what we have been talking about since april
4482208 state revenues generating an equivalent hold harmless amount for schools
4482209 the limitation on the implementation of the hold harmless amount is a material fact of which the voter must be given notice if the title and summary are to meet
4482210 requirement that the voter be given fair notice of the content and sweep of the proposal
4482211 i dont think theres anything constitutionally wrong with mixing things
4482212 but they raised the bar by having to explain it
4482213 with 25 members and with everyone having different ideas and with certain people in the group wanting to make sure his gets in its very difficult to get meaningful language in an amendment
4482214 homeownership is a fundamental right and floridians deserve a say on how their property is taxed
4482215 we are shocked that the court decided to deny property owners the ability to dramatically lower their property tax rates

4482221 i did not even have a moment to relish that i was a candidate
4482222 im sensing some resistance and hesitation for people to embrace change
4482223 theyre very active and very sincere folks but some of the people i talked with didnt even know what precinct they vote in
4482224 all of a sudden theyre active good im glad but some might say they should not start at the top
4482225 you may have heard that barack obama will be visiting orange county this
4482226 the judges comments reflect what weve been hearing about the uncertainty of the amendment
4482227 its very vague on how it will hold education harmless just on the surface you have to find 7 billion for education when you think youre getting a tax cut
4482228 i think our present property tax system needs to be addressed
4482229 it goes back to our old save our homes in the early 90s and time has shown that that has some flaws fixing our property tax system will be a long hard battle and we felt this was an important step
4482230 its unfair to commercial homeowners and second homeowners snowbirds and our taxes have become a burden
4482231 ive got several concerns about it so im looking at what my options are
4482232 my career is what it is the most relevant part is my service as a judge
4482233 we need a diverse bench to help ensure justice is impartially dispensed overall
4482234 of the people for the people and representive to the people
4482235 this amendment is a bad deal for florida and a bait and switch proposal of the worst kind
4482236 even though we consider todays ruling a victory for the voters and taxpayers of florida we will continue to fight against the amendment until all appeals are exhausted
4482237 homeownership is a fundamental right and floridians deserve a say on how their property is taxed
4482238 we are shocked that the court decided to deny property owners the ability to dramatically lower their property tax rates
4482239 the court finds that the ballot title and summary provided in the proposition for amendment 5 fail to fairly inform the voter in clear and unambiguous language of the chief purposes of the amendment and the language of the title and summary as written is misleading
4482240 voters need clear information and this amendment fell short it was called a tax swap but it was never clear what we were swapping for
4482241 amendment 5 would have exposed floridas schools to budget cuts by removing a stable property tax without a full explanation of how it would be replaced it would have been left up to future legislatures to deal with the unknown consequences and tax increases
4482242 the clear implication is that the school funding lost by the cut in ad valorem taxes will be fully replaced by the state of florida on a permanent basis
4482243 the proposed amendment does not do this it provides a hold harmless for school for only one year
4482244 the florida chamber believes a special legislative session is needed because floridas taxpayers have an urgent need for property tax relief and taxpayer fairness
4482245 to create more jobs and opportunities for florida we must enact immediate solutions that make our tax system fair and sustainable
4482246 id like to know how many people care what my fathers company does with its money politically
4482247 why did you the only one the lowest in the polls decide to bash tom rooney and gayle harrell the only one who will use that is mahoney
4482248 if you see my name there i probably signed it
4482249 i believe as a catholic that the marriages should be between a man and a woman i believe that i believe thats the correct way of describing a marriage as between a man and a woman
4482250 i work for all taxpayers i work for all taxpayers in broward county regardless of race or religion or partnership as a public servant i will serve all taxpayers
4482251 i dont have to recognize anything i just have to hire people to work to do the job they are assigned to do who are willing to work for the taxpayers
4482252 help me howard racially motivated in a bad way school board candidate accuses incumbent of improper use of school district e mail broward candidate offers the years most bizarre political video broward county is an unusually rich territory for political news
4482253 he was a special person and he cared about his state
4482254 if he were here he would tell us to not forget what were about and thats taking care of the people
4482255 those are things were investigating right now we dont have any indication of motive as far as it deals with mr gwatney
4482256 the manager asked him if he needed to talk at that point he turned in his badge and left the building
4482257 he was pretty blunt but always had something good to say even if it was something someone didnt like on the other side
4482258 i went to bill and i said i hate to do this but i need to borrow some money to bury my father
4482259 he said blaine whatever you need youve got it thats the kind of man bill was he had a deep love for all of his employees and i can say we all had a deep love for him
4482260 accelerate florida will pump billions of dollars into floridas economy through construction and economic development projects that are already in the hopper
4482261 they want to know that permitting and regulation the walls are being broken down
4482262 unfortunately these problems are not going away and avoiding a special session wont reduce the hurt floridians are feeling or solve the deep woes confronting our state
4482263 logically speaking the most successful long term solution to everglades pollution may be to buy out the polluters and currently that option appears viable
4482264 delay may indeed be the enemy of the everglades but paradoxically there is no quick fix for its problems
4482265 i dont think theres any doubt that they need the funds for the acquisition right now
4482266 this ruling makes it clear that there is a full judicial endorsement that this acquisition of u s sugar is the best big picture long term solution
4482267 in an election year it was going to be very difficult to get that waiver to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to an increasingly aggressive russia where the prime minister is acting more and more like a czar
4482268 degrade and burn up on reentry or with us ceding it to those who can get there
4482269 unfortunately we have no plan but to rely on the russians
4482270 the administration and budget office just havent provided the funds to avoid that
4482271 the concern ive had all along is that we just dont know what the geopolitical landscape will be during those years we have to depend on russia
4482272 you look at the situation now and relying on russia looks like a pretty bad idea
4482273 ive been saying for several years that once the russians have a monopoly on flying astronauts to the station they could and probably would use it to pressure the united states for diplomatic purposes
4482274 if the u s says no then they can always find a reason why a soyuz wouldnt be ready to fly when its needed
4482275 congress could very well say the hell with the russians we wont approve the waiver even if it badly hurts our program and interests
4482276 forty five years ago hundreds of thousands of americans travelled from all across the country and risked threats of violence to converge on
4482277 during the democratic convention in denver civil rights and faith leaders will come together to commemorate the anniversary of that historic march that created a tipping point for change in this country and to reaffirm democrats dedication to dr kings dream
4482278 more people stealing more robberies failure to pay foreclosures car loans not being paid all of that goes up significantly
4482279 its affecting us directly because the most recent rounds of budget cuts have really hit hard in the family law division
4482280 weve lost one of our two general magistrates and weve lost one of our two case managers who did divorces
4482281 its backing up our case load because of the volume
4482282 when you have something as traumatic as dissolution of marriage the sooner you can get the wound to start healing the better
4482283 and leaving those kinds of things open is tough for everybody
4482284 whatever comes of all that ill continue to have peace
4482285 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them that are called according to his purpose
4482286 if we can cut your property tax bill by a third the homeowner will have more money to spend people will be able to afford housing they may not be able to today and renters will stabilize
4482287 basically there will be more money going into everyones hands in the state of florida
4482288 with a sales tax the item you buy is something that is yours to do what you want
4482289 thirteen businesses came to florida taking 199 000 policies out of citizens
4482290 it would allow insurance companies to get out of the windstorm business and that would result in lower insurance
4482291 someone that is in leadership is going to have a little more clout than a freshman
4482292 been at the table with the leadership deciding if this and that makes sense for the state
4482293 ive knocked on the doors of 5 200 homes planning to get to 9 000
4482294 im finding that sometimes you need a fresh look from someone who has been outside
4482295 my opponent likes to say we could have done more we did the best we could at the time there is always more to do
4482296 frankly its the greatest honor that ive ever had in my professional life
4482297 i feel as if i know the court system from the bottom to the top and it gives me not only diverse experience but i also have a great deal of empathy for lawyers litigants trial judges everyone that has an occasion to touch the system
4482298 im at the stage in my career where i am content either way
4482299 i love the job that im doing now if the governor decides that i can serve the citizens better in the position im in at this time ill happily stay in this position for the balance of my judicial career
4482300 the significant increase in property values across the state has provided local government with a windfall of property tax revenue
4482301 rather than returning this windfall revenue to florida taxpayers they have chosen to spend this money at a rate faster than a taxpayers ability to pay
4482302 you want unity which is why the obama people have been generous to the clintons
4482303 i dont think thats a mistake i think thats smart
4482304 well be there and we are not going away anytime soon see you in denver
4482305 but i also believe florida meetings should be open to the sunshine so if you go to a public meeting by golly it better be open to the public
4482306 it will be appealed it doesnt mean anything what really matters is what the last ruling is not the first
4482307 i think its a lot of vindication for what we have been talking about since april
4482308 state revenues generating an equivalent hold harmless amount for schools
4482309 the limitation on the implementation of the hold harmless amount is a material fact of which the voter must be given notice if the title and summary are to meet the constitutional requirement that the voter be given fair notice of the content and sweep of the proposal
4482310 i dont think theres anything constitutionally wrong with mixing things
4482311 but they raised the bar by having to explain it
4482312 with 25 members and with everyone having different ideas and with certain people in the group wanting to make sure his gets in its very difficult to get meaningful language in an amendment summary with 75 words or less
4482313 homeownership is a fundamental right and floridians deserve a say on how their property is taxed
4482314 we are shocked that the court decided to deny property owners the ability to dramatically lower their property tax rates
4482315 most vulnerable low income children are covered first without moving them from private to public coverage
4482316 tens of thousands of kids have already lost out on coverage as a result of the directive
4482317 ive got several concerns about it so im looking at what my options are
4482318 yes i want a more diverse court even if it means having someone that is not the most qualified from all the applicants
4482319 i want more color and gender and do not care who applies go out in this world and find me diversity
4482320 judges turn aside from their proper role whenever they seek in any way to substitute their own will for the will of the people as reflected in the pertinent statutory and constitutional texts
4482321 the people of florida depend on our expediency in putting their dollars to work
4482322 aggressively move forward with projects that will create jobs and make the sunshine state even brighter
4482323 the governor hasnt made a decision on what he might do
4482324 youre generating dollars that will be spent and generate taxes it wont be a lot but every little bit helps
4482325 judges turn aside from their proper role whenever they seek in any way to substitute their own will for the will of the people as reflected in the pertinent statutory and constitutional texts
4482326 ive got several concerns about it so im looking at what my options might be
4482327 this is the largest back to back year to year decrease in state funding you have to go back to the great depression to find an impact like this
4482328 were saying to them were not going to just stand by and take another 5 or 10 percent reduction in our funding its not going to work
4482329 i recognize the difficult situation the legislators are in but tearing out the safety net of our society is not the solution
4482330 if i take a charter fishing boat in the state of florida i dont have to pay any taxes on the trip
4482331 now whos chartering a fishing boat someone who can afford to pay 6 or 7 percent tax
4482332 i would like to handle the case in the direction of granting a visa
4482333 whether to permit surrogate pregnancy is a matter to be discussed by respective institutions
4482334 the ministry will study the possibilities under the law out of consideration for the childs future
4482335 the purpose of the air guitar world championships is to promote world peace according to the ideology of the air guitar wars end climate change stops and all bad things disappear if all the people in the world played the air guitar this is why the whole universe is invited to play the air guitar for the world peace at the end of the competition
4482336 the late great usa the coming merger with mexico and canada
4482337 is ok with the pope as long as it isnt reported by the liberal press
4482338 pushed by conservative book clubs that buy in bulk to drive up sales
4482339 making sure jerome corsi doesnt get away with his lies unchallenged
4482340 the lawyers for the mayor said they were willing to comply
4482341 i see absolutely no reason for that and its silly
4482342 if someone wants to discuss changes to that theyre going to have to bring that up with us
4482343 isnt it a shame that we pay attention to that
4482344 you might as well hook them into going to school
4482345 i love the fact that you decide when you want to go to school if youre a morning person an afternoon person or an evening person
4482346 theyre doing everything they can to help students to learn in the way they learn best
4482347 unlike many charter schools who are in competition with the existing schools we are not
4482348 our schools are designed to bring students back to the public school system and help them with a very focused program that better meets their needs
4482349 it shouldnt surprise anyone that bitterly divisive democrats like barney frank dont have anything good to say about republicans fair minded people look at mitt romney and see a strong leader a man of character and integrity who was elected as governor at a time of job loss and recession and who managed to balance the budget all four years without raising taxes and get the massachusetts economy moving again
4482350 i think there are better choices for senator mccain that have the approval of value voters
4482351 the issue is that in many ways mitt romney has had very definite swings of position not just on one or two things but on many of the issues
4482352 a sampling of the lies half truths and misleading statements
4482353 three fourths of them have found acceptance for sen mccain and are willing to work for him but there is always a faction that takes a little more
4482354 huckabee is the leader of what i call the taliban wing of the party
4482355 they would rather lose on some self defined principle than put someone on the ticket who is honorable and would bring strength to the ticket
4482356 ive always been very much into constitutional rights and gun rights
4482357 it seems retarded that you cant protect yourself on an open campus its ridiculous
4482358 people think were trying to force guns everywhere and its going to be a bloodbath but thats not the case
4482359 i dont have a lot of confidence that a college kid with a gun or any untrained person for that matter will get into a successful shootout with a bad guy
4482360 this is one of the craziest ideas anyone has ever thought of
4482361 the permit holder might be the all american kid who has never done anything wrong in his or her life
4482362 but what if they live in the dorms the roommate might be a moron
4482363 its unfortunate but when a kid goes on campus and starts shooting it gives attention to our cause
4482364 if i may be so bold there was another president
4482365 at one time there was a president named ronald reagan who spoke very strongly about americas advocacy for democracy and freedom
4482366 we talk about how theres only one president at a time so the idea that you would send your own emissaries and really interfere with the process is remarkable
4482367 its very risky and can send mixed messages to foreign governments they accused obama of being presumptuous but he didnt do anything close to this
4482368 part of a strategic energy corridor affecting individual lives far beyond
4482369 these are the kinds of things that the president should have been saying from the beginning
4482370 we want to avoid any armed conflict and we will not have armed conflict
4482371 thats not the solution to this problem but we have to stand up for freedom and democracy as we did in the darkest days
4482372 you know i think he spends less time on his presidential campaign these days and lots of time on georgia
4482373 and i really appreciate that because senator mccain has been fighting for freedom of georgia for many many years
4482374 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4482375 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4482376 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president
4482377 i never said he wasnt qualified the constitution sets qualification for the president and then the people decide who they think would be the better president
4482378 i grew up believing an evangelical couldnt be a democrat
4482379 when you look at the political party that has traditionally championed poverty social justice and care for the least of these its not been the republican party
4482380 we are to honor the least of these above even ourselves its very difficult to reconcile totally
4482381 i dont think any young evangelical is ignoring the traditional values issues but they are adding other issues including poverty and war and they are also looking at integrity and family
4482382 they tried to feel me out and see where i stood
4482383 people will have to make a decision on whether they want to stand there and smile or run away i think theyll run away depending partly on the national media coverage
4482384 if he decides to go its an exercise in poor judgment to put people in damaging situations
4482385 i dont think the party itself will do that but i hope his handlers will help him see that
4482386 every day kwame is in trouble every day he puts on that tether every time they march him to jail is a day the democrat party loses favor with the voting public
4482387 michigan voters know that mayor kilpatricks troubles are his own and that barack obama is focused on bringing people together to solve the serious challenges we face
4482388 these kinds of silly political attacks dont help a single person afford health care dont create a single job or help a single michigan manufacturer
4482389 theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
4482390 unfortunately there are those who have issues with race on a fundamental level
4482391 what the mayor does by his own behavior is play out all these negative stereotypes making it easier for people to try to tie obama to kilpatrick and his behavior
4482392 this is their opportunity to indict an entire people for the very public foibles of a few
4482393 to stand there and praise mayor kilpatrick as a great mayor who is to be emulated all across the country is kind of laughable
4482394 the nomination of senator obama at the democratic national convention will be a historic event however im focused on running the city and i dont want anything to distract from that extraordinary moment the focus should remain on uniting the party and leading our great nation in a different direction
4482395 the right to health to home to work to family to culture is false and illusory if the right to life the most basic and fundamental right and the condition for all other personal rights is not defended with maximum determination
4482396 failed to provide readers with an adequate understanding of this program and misrepresented the very spirit of the document
4482397 that catholics are called to form their consciences in order to exercise faithful citizenship
4482398 does not begin or end at the polling booth we are even told how to form our consciences beginning with a willingness and openness to seek the truth and what is right through the study of sacred scripture and the catechism of the catholic church and continuing with an examination of the background related to the choices before us we are told that forming our conscience also requires prayerful reflection to discern the will of god section 18
4482399 and yet nowhere in the article is the need to form ones conscience ever addressed instead readers are led to believe that they should vote on the basis of what they think or feel there is no reference to this active process catholics are instructed to perform the very essence of what it means to be a faithful citizen is omitted
4482400 is the compilation of general principles applied to the obligation that catholics have to exercise political responsibility in the light of their faith regardless of whether it is an election year and irrespective of the candidates who are running and the issues on which they are basing their campaigns
4482401 the times handling of the very delicate and complex challenge of voting also failed to represent the full scope of the bishops instructions the statement goes into great detail to emphasize that not all issues carry the same moral weight and that opposing intrinsically evil acts has a special claim on our consciences and our actions section 37 the document further cautions against the moral equivalence that makes no ethical distinctions between different kinds of issues involving human life and dignity the direct and intentional destruction of innocent human life from the moment of conception until natural death is always wrong and is not just one issue among many it must always be opposed section 28
4482402 could arguably steal the title of the pro life party
4482403 with eight years of bush the abortion rates have not declined every indication is that with financial support and different forms of supporting pregnant mother and then some post birth help also we could come close to 50 reduction in abortions thats huge thats huge
4482404 had to go up against the status quo very strong and well financed voices
4482405 would go a very long way in establishing trust with evangelicals that would huge
4482406 people are saying wait a minute what else did we think was going to go right that didnt go right theres kind of a ripple effect of disillusionment
4482407 i can help raise him money and if he wants my pretty face standing by his side at one of these rallies id be glad to show up
4482408 the only way for mccain and the republican party to play catch up is to raise for the rnc and use president bush as the attraction
4482409 i think hes a bigger fundraising draw than mccain among the republican hard core
4482410 for the candidates there are pluses that bush brings and difficulties
4482411 the plus is that he can raise money the difficulty is that he brings his job approval with him and people are going to have to figure out how to effectively balance that out as they look at their own situation
4482412 but i think if his current popularity ratings continue to be low its going to be tough to find people who are really eager to go to him for help
4482413 until somebody else emerges as the party leader the former guy is going to be a big draw
4482414 shes an effective and proven leader and you all know how much enthusiasm she has and the passion she has about children health issues
4482415 as most of you know i am not unfamiliar with the healthy kids corp
4482416 it is something that is important to me and important to the lives of all floridians
4482417 the corporation helps thousands of uninsured children gain access to affordable quality health care
4482418 participation by school districts health plans and other entities in this initiative is voluntary and a key factor in the programs success with operational sites
4482419 one thing thats possible is that she was still owed money from what shed done before for the political action committee but obviously there are less charitable explanations
4482420 i talked to john tuesday and hes not doing well
4482421 hes just to be very frank with you hes just not doing well he needs to be concentrating on himself and his family at this point in his life hes a good boy he just made a hell of a mistake

4482427 i am very pleased and excited by the leadership melissa harwood rom has demonstrated in our combined academic support program
4482428 the addition of tamesha justin and louis reflect our continued effort to provide our student athletes the very best in academic support our ultimate goal is graduation and we are committed to providing the resources necessary to assist our young people in achieving this goal
4482429 youll see a campaign that is better at staying on message
4482430 our problem is to keep these interactions to a manageable point
4482431 but what were learning is that once you become the nominee every word is seized upon
4482432 his day is more structured focused on getting the message out
4482433 while people are paying 3 75 a gallon for gas
4482434 what you have to realize is that this is a marathon
4482435 i think john would do a town hall meeting that would last for days
4482436 john dont wear yourself out make sure your message resonates visually
4482437 its something that weve wanted to do and we want it to be legal and we are very very excited
4482438 for a recognizes how closely innovation and imagination are tied
4482439 were dedicated to listening to our customers and developing products that meet their needs in new and exciting ways as evidenced by the array of new products were bringing out at this years ibc convention
4482440 some would say that justice is the answer and indeed we should always seek justice
4482441 however we know that in a flawed and broken world complete justice is hardly ever experienced
4482442 we do not live in a world where we can experience absolute justice with justice as with so many other things in life we frequently have to settle for something less than the absolute
4482443 some lone nut im not so sure i did some checking and the burnsley hotel where saleman abdirahman dirie died is not a cheap hotel i just checked onlin e and rooms start at 199 a night mr dirie was in that room dead for six days before his body was found so theres about 1200 sunk into just rent toss in transportation and acquiring the cyanide and other expenses and this was obviously no impulsive fly by night operation
4482444 the fbi says theres no apparent connection to terrorism but im not buying it what mr dirie apparently wanted to do was not disrupt not call attention to his pet cause but murder hundreds of democrats americans participating in the political process exercising their constitutional rights to shape events and influence policy and help choose our next government thats something that transcends politics
4482445 we havent found any conclusive evidence of conspiracy as of this moment
4482446 there was lots of dancing involved and the limbo was very popular
4482447 the main thing was to get the community together make them aware of what we do and improve what we already have here
4482448 some lone nut im not so sure i did some checking and the burnsley hotel where saleman abdirahman dirie died is not a cheap hotel i just checked onlin e and rooms start at 199 a night mr dirie was in that room dead for six days before his body was found so theres about 1200 sunk into just rent toss in transportation and acquiring the cyanide and other expenses and this was obviously no impulsive fly by night operation

4482463 you can fool some of the people all of the time and you can fool all of the people some of the time but you cant fool all of the people all of the time
4482464 you only need to fool enough of the people at the right time
4482465 if someone were to call you a homosexual would you consider it a smear
4482466 what you wont hear from this campaign or this party is the kind of politics that uses religion as a wedge

4482470 the company has also cited its strategy of showing the olympics on multiple platforms television internet mobile video on demand mobile as helping to drive viewers to primetime shows
4482471 nearly 25 million people have visited nbcolympics com viewing 456 million pages and watching close to 22 million video clips nbc said on thursday recording more page views than for the entire 2004 games in athens
4482472 nbc universals efforts could set the tone for how future sports or entertainment events are covered on the internet easing concerns that the web would eat into tv ratings the result could be more advertising deals that incorporate both broadcast and online elements
4482473 and nbc is proving that big media is perfectly positioned to take advantage of integrated media

4482476 some families from the past have told us they cant afford it anymore
4482477 gave the impression we were telling associates how to vote they were wrong and acting without approval
4482478 we believe that if the fec looks into this they will find what weve known all along that we did nothing wrong
4482479 globalization and technology and automation all weaken the position of workers
4482480 ive gotten a lot of questions the last few weeks asking if obama is the antichrist
4482481 i tell everyone that i dont think the antichrist will come out of politics especially american politics
4482482 i can see by the language he uses why people think he could be the antichrist
4482483 but from my reading of scripture he doesnt meet the criteria there is no indication in the bible that the antichrist will be an american
4482484 we both probably came to the realization that there is not one set back
4482485 weve been fighting for it going on two two and a half years now
4482486 and were both like man were just going to deal with it you take these plays ill take these plays well divide it up like that
4482487 most guys would lay there on their back with their feet straight in the air kicking their feet or whatever drawing attention
4482488 he got up very casually and jogged off the field the trainers didnt even come out to see him and taylor knew the arm was broke
4482489 i dont like to sit out just knowing that i probably could be in the game plan but im not it would have been too much for me to take
4482490 im always looking for that home run grand slam hit
4482491 with jaycen hes more like tap away tap away tap away then hit you real big
4482492 it could be the beginning of practice and i know weve got 10 plays or 12 plays and im like hey were one and done
4482493 you could be trying to get 1 yard and fumble the ball
4482494 so looking for a home run and fumbling the ball its not directly correlated when people say that i just ignore it
4482495 kory would like to be the guy and get all the carries
4482496 this is a little thing its a non issue for me but to kory sheets its really important to him as to who is named the starter jaycen taylor could care less
4482497 each condition of metabolic syndrome phenomenon high blood pressure type 2 diabetes and obesity independently raises the risk for erectile dysfunction just on their own
4482498 and so when all are present in combination as part of this syndrome you have a situation where you dont even need to be as diabetic or hypertensive as you might otherwise have to be to experience erectile dysfunction and that fact has been raising concern among clinicians
4482499 so we followed up on case reports and anecdotal evidence that statins being used to lower cholesterol over a six to eight week period among patients with metabolic syndrome seemed to also quickly improve erections even before cholesterol levels go down
4482500 and in an animal model we found this to be the case
4482501 statins are used by everyone under the sun and as far as i know theres been no hard evidence that it can be used to treat erectile dysfunction
4482502 on the other hand it may be that it could prevent or modify some of the other risk factors for erectile dysfunction
4482503 part d continues to come in under budget achieve consistently high satisfaction rates and with it millions of americans are living healthier better lives
4482504 most beneficiaries will see a premium increase in their current plan there will be some significant increases
4482505 first there is a trend in prescription drug cost growth generally prices tend to increase because of price increases for existing drugs the growth in the average number of prescriptions per person and the introduction of new drugs
4482506 so they have adjusted their 2009 bids to reflect those higher than anticipated costs
4482507 in addition 97 percent of people in stand alone prescription drug plans will have access to a 2009 plan with equal or lower cost premiums than their 2008 plan
4482508 moreover many medicare beneficiaries will have access to a medicare advantage plan that offers lower prescription drug premiums than a stand alone plan
4482509 theres no question ottawa is doing the right thing in preventing people from extending the amortization periods too far

4482589 the idea of going to georgia through iran has a two fold purpose
4482590 it saves fuel to go on a more direct route and we can also look for those weapons of mass destruction we know iran has
4482591 them french are so good at surrendering youd of thought all that peace and appeasement they were talking about would have worked
4482592 but listen to me you frenchies if we want brie well call you otherwise butt out
4482593 the whole idea was to streamline three agencies into one and make it very flexible
4482594 you talk to anybody in the agency theyre totally demoralised the structure sucks and its totally bureaucratic the whole idea of being flexible is laughable
4482595 we discovered that it was ok to have a little high brow as long you have a lot of low brow thats entertainment value the one thing you want to avoid is the middle brow because the whole world is frigging middle brow at the moment

4482600 the assassinations are back especially in the last two weeks just like before
4482601 two men on a motorbike have been shooting people and five barbers have been killed in the last week alone the militiamen and some of the commanders of the mahdi army are still there they dont carry weapons in public but they are still there a few months ago if you wanted to import anything through the port you had to bribe the mahdi army officials who controlled the port now the iraqi army and the government are in control so you only bribe one official now there is no work apart from collecting garbage it doesnt matter if you are an engineer or a college graduate and you have to bribe someone in the municipality to get work as a street sweeper
4482602 the mahdi army doesnt exist publicly but the killers and assassins are still there and people are still getting killed though less than before the militiamen are wearing government uniforms
4482603 the army raids remind us of what the baathists and saddams mukhabarat secret police used to do we thought that after saddam we would be living in a new iraq but the same system is back for example now the directorate of education is controlled by a new militia theyve started replacing headteachers with their own men
4482604 there is less kidnapping and killing but the militiamen are still there though they are not armed in the streets there are so many of them they cant arrest them if they did theyd have to arrest half of basra if you are a state employee then life is good but if you dont have a fixed salary then things are very hard
4482605 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent

4482615 on the topic of theme songs yesterday i archived a focus north cbc north weekly magazine show 79 91 approx from 1987 in which the composer of its theme song was interviewed
4482616 if youre interested in watching the failings of the most unimpressive and unmotivated olympic team ever then cbc is the place to be
4482617 why is it that during the hours that china sleeps but which are our prime morning and afternoon times most of your olympic program consists of commercials adds about your fall programs interviews and talks by your many commentators
4482618 its quite mind blowing to not only access such a wide audience but to be in direct contact with the people who watch your film i also love that viewers are from all over the world every filmmaker spends incredible amounts of time and effort in making what they do but short films are still to date mostly considered show reel material and practice for a longer format an opportunity to screen outside of the film festival circuit is very refreshing and rewarding

4482657 the level of growth of repossession orders suggests that we are on track for a repossession crisis very similar to the early 1990s
4482658 it is absolutely vital that the government should intervene and require a proper code of conduct to be implemented by mortgage lenders
4482659 this should not just apply to the big banks but to the large number of secondary lenders who are using court action to pursue their debts in a very aggressive way
4482660 the council for mortgage lenders code of conduct should be put on a statutory footing for all repossession actions
4482661 he betrayed families by claiming hed abolished boom and bust and encouraging a spend now pay later culture
4482662 now times are getting tougher thousands are losing their homes because they can no longer make ends meet
4482663 lenders must now act responsibly even if our prime minister has not done so to minimise the number of people losing their homes
4482664 whilst we are not seeing repossessions on the same scale as the early 1990s we are making sure the right advice and support is available for the minority of borrowers who may need it at the moment because of global economic pressures
4482665 as well as expanding free legal representation in county courts for households at risk of repossession we are providing more free debt advice and are working closely with lenders to ensure that repossession is only ever a last resort
4482666 these services can make a real difference with more than 80 of repossessions avoided when they are used it is important that families who have concerns seek advice at the earliest opportunity starting by speaking to their lender
4482667 hm great do you know the expression to be damned by faint praise
4482668 there are some evidence that weve lost some momentum but a lot of the weakness were in the motor vehicles nevertheless its one more source of nervousness right now the markets are clearly worried about a slowdown and a decline in retail sales certainly would add to those fears

4482791 its certainly not ideal conditions for them to be in we dont know what equipment they have whether anyone is injured we dont even know whether the signal being put out is coming from these climbers or another group or individual
4482792 it didnt seem like they had much just the basics like packs and clothing
4482793 if theres a lot of snow it would be extremely dangerous in those conditions you just wouldnt do it
4482794 there are a number of groups climbing including a group of six australians so at this stage it is not clear which party triggered the rescue beacon
4482795 ich denke dass wir jetzt den blick nach vorne richten m ssen
4482796 nach allem was passiert ist ist es unwahrscheinlich dass osseten und abchasen jemals wieder in der lage sein werden mit georgien in einem staat zu leben
4482797 wenn unsere friedenstruppen und unsere b rger angegriffen werden werden wir auch in zukunft so antworten wie wir geantwortet haben
4482798 they have to leave the shelter because we actually invited them at a time of need we think enough has been done to do that
4482799 we are also convinced that conditions exist in all the communities in gauteng for the displaced people to safely return to their places so we dont expect anybody to refuse to leave
4482800 its not safe theyre saying were going to kill them
4482801 in terms of real financial impact it has been limited japanese banks have a relatively small exposure to the sub prime problems in the united states if you look at the whole japanese banking sector it only amounts to about one us bank
4482802 they are likely to use that bank in the future not in the immediate to make other us acquisitions on their behalf of course banks in the us are in delicate situation at the moment especially after the housing market crisis and us banks are all a lot cheaper than they were before
4482803 it could be some good opportunities not only for mitsubishi ufj but for other japanese banks to go into that market and pick up some good solid banking franchise
4482804 nach der neuen hessischen bauordnung hbo 2002 handelt es sich entsprechend der anlage 2 ber baugenehmigungsfreie vorhaben nach paragraf 55 ziffer 1

4482812 weve been working with the le sueur county parks coordinator theyre interested in it but they have the same concerns we do about the financial arrangements
4482813 its our hope that this would tie something together as part of a state trail system

4482815 in an election year it was going to be very difficult to get that waiver to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to an increasingly aggressive russia where the prime minister is acting more and more like a czar
4482816 degrade and burn up on reentry or with us ceding it to those who can get there
4482817 unfortunately we have no plan but to rely on the russians
4482818 the administration and budget office just havent provided the funds to avoid that
4482819 the concern ive had all along is that we just dont know what the geopolitical landscape will be during those years we have to depend on russia
4482820 you look at the situation now and relying on russia looks like a pretty bad idea
4482821 ive been saying for several years that once the russians have a monopoly on flying astronauts to the station they could and probably would use it to pressure the united states for diplomatic purposes
4482822 if the u s says no then they can always find a reason why a soyuz wouldnt be ready to fly when its needed
4482823 congress could very well say the hell with the russians we wont approve the waiver even if it badly hurts our program and interests
4482824 impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4482825 impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4482826 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation
4482827 a higher incentive to stand with us now than they did before now that they have seen what the russians have done in georgia
4482828 the united states stands strongly for the territorial integrity of georgia
4482829 a new reality which poses new problems in terms of maintaining the territorial integrity of georgia
4482830 we respect the wishes of the people of abkhazia and south ossetia
4482831 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia
4482832 began what we hoped would be an ongoing and long term strategic dialogue with the russian federation the expectation was that our two nations despite our differences shared areas of common interest where we could work together as real partners
4482833 russias behavior over the past week has called into question the entire premise of that dialogue
4482834 and has profound implications for our security relationship going forward both bilaterally and with nato
4482835 my view is that the russians and i would say principally prime minister putin is interested in reasserting not only russias great power or superpower status but in reasserting russias traditional spheres of influence
4482836 i think that there is an effort to try and redress what they regard as many of the concessions they feel were forced upon them in the early 1990s after the collapse of the soviet union
4482837 looking at total compensation wages plus benefits federal workers earned an average 116 450 in 2007 which is more than double the 57 615 private sector average
4482838 the federal compensation advantage increased from 68 percent in 2000 to 102 percent today federal workers not only earn much more than private sector workers their earnings advantage is getting more pronounced every year
4482839 the united states has used contractors during previous military operations although not to the current extent according to rough historical data the ratio of about one contractor employee for every member of the u s armed forces in the iraq theater is at least 2 5 times higher than that ratio during any other major u s conflict although it is roughly comparable with the ratio during operations in the balkans in the 1990s
4482840 from 2003 through 2007 u s agencies awarded 85 billion in contracts for work to be principally performed in the iraq theater accounting for almost 20 percent of funding for operations in iraq
4482841 contractors provide a wide range of products and services in theater most contract obligations over the 2003 2007 period were for logistics support construction petroleum products or food
4482842 the costs of a private security contract are comparable with those of a u s military unit performing similar functions during peacetime however the private security contract would not have to be renewed whereas the military unit would remain in the force structure

4482853 i have to remark again the extraordinary power of the new podcasts by hearing dr hulsmann
4482854 each condition of metabolic syndrome phenomenon high blood pressure type 2 diabetes and obesity independently raises the risk for erectile dysfunction just on their own
4482855 and so when all are present in combination as part of this syndrome you have a situation where you dont even need to be as diabetic or hypertensive as you might otherwise have to be to experience erectile dysfunction and that fact has been raising concern among clinicians
4482856 so we followed up on case reports and anecdotal evidence that statins being used to lower cholesterol over a six to eight week period among patients with metabolic syndrome seemed to also quickly improve erections even before cholesterol levels go down
4482857 and in an animal model we found this to be the case
4482858 diluted by several other factors like other nutrients drugs social stimulation and diseases
4482859 one hour after they drank red bull their blood systems were no longer normal they were abnormal like we would expect in a patient with cardiovascular disease
4482860 the study does not show effects which would go beyond that of drinking a cup of coffee therefore the reported results were to be expected and lie within the normal physiological range
4482861 if you have any predisposition to cardiovascular disease id think twice about drinking it
4482862 the more you smoke the more likely you are to have a stroke
4482863 certainly quitting is the best thing you could do but cutting back does offer some benefit

4482901 i think that would have a big impact on behavior and focus
4482902 not preservatives stabilizers artificial flavors or high fructose corn syrup
4482903 its just a matter of getting parents and school boards to demand real food for their school lunch programs

4482917 the model 3000 is a state of the art preamplifier using modern solid state technology from its fully shielded tightly regulated power supply to its unique gold plated tactile feel pushbuttons the creativity and craftsmanship of the 3000 are evident touching a pushbutton or turning a knob will convince you of the precision and quality of the components used to make the model 3000 not only elegant to look at but a pleasure to operate
4482918 innovative features of the 3000 preamplifier include its cmos logic memory system used to control relays for all critical switching two independent riaa phono stages for elimination of all low level switching built in head amp for moving coil cartridge reproduction stepped attenuator volume control and noise reduction input output jacks for installation of outboard noise processors only the highest quality components have been used to assemble the model 3000 including 1 metal film resistors 2 polystyrene capacitors and solid tantalum capacitors all to guarantee the high performance specifications for the life of the unit quality is not limited to just electrical components but extends to the rugged 20 gauge cold rolled steel chassis for minimization of magnetically induced interference to the solid glass epoxy double sided printed circuit boards to the deep grained 3 16 inch thick front panel and to the oversized 16 gauge line cord
4482919 considerable design effort has been put into the model 3000 to separate fact from aural fantasy with regard to audio reproduction use of third generation integrated circuits creates virtual immunity from overloading caused by either steady state or transient effects whether amplitude frequency or slew induced absolute minimizing of non linearities and noise allows a clarity and accuracy of sound reproduction unsurpassed
4482920 the use of relays allows a circuit design where all critical signal paths are reduced to the absolute minimum by locating the relays right at the input jacks and routing only non critical dc control signals to the front panel further reduction of the signal path is achieved by the two riaa stages where less than one inch separates the input jack and the equalizing amplifier and no switching is done until further amplification

4482941 what ive seen over the last couple of years is that its becoming progressively harder for the smaller clubs to survive

4482943 i can see at premier league level we have the most fabulous product
4482944 but below premier league level particularly below the championship there are so many clubs struggling
4482945 a lot of the discussions are about financial survival thats the sort of discussions we are having in the boardrooms with our opposite numbers
4482946 with regard to the shareholding i just want to take the right approach in making sure it ends in responsible hands
4482947 well youd just like to feel that its selling it to people who care about the club and ideally put some money into the club

4482966 ca pnl sa impuna pd l sa se lepede de boc sau de altii
4482967 nu cred ca si pnl trebuie sa procedeze ca pd l ati vazut ca de fiecare data pdl ul prin exponentii lui incearca sa sugereze ca s ar putea apropia de pnl daca ar disparea din fruntea partidului tariceanu si alti cativa ceea ce cred ca este o greseala fatala pentru un partid politic sau pentru politicieni sa incerce sa schimbe structura de conducere a unui partid politic prin imixtiune si prin factori extreni asa ceva este total nedemocratic si cred ca pnl nu poate sa faca o asemenea greseala sa impuna pd l sa faca acelasi lucru sa se lepede de boc sau de altii ca boc
4482968 pd l trebuie sa admita ca a incercat sa distruga pnl
4482969 pd l ar trebui sa recunoasca faptul ca a incercat la presiunea lui traian basescu sa distruga pnl
4482970 a si reusit o bucatica luand o parte din liberali sau din cei care au fost reprezentativi la un moment dat pentru liberalism
4482971 au facut un alt partid si s au unit cu el deci cred ca pd l va trebui sa recunoasca cinstit ca a incercat sa faca acest lucru si atunci cred ca toata lumea ar sti despre ce este vorba si toate frustrarile acumulate intre cele doua partide s ar putea atenua si macar stiind pe ce pozitie te afli poti sa continui o actiune comuna
4482972 each file with two or three or four up to 20 profiles
4482973 cumulatively there were about 300 profiles collected in that one day
4482974 we realized that it was a phishing attack of course but also that these phishers timed it with an apple event
4482975 it looks like that raised the conversion rate of their captures

4482981 we are not as divided as our politics suggest we are one people we are one nation
4482982 gave the impression we were telling associates how to vote they were wrong and acting without approval
4482983 we believe that if the fec looks into this they will find what weve known all along that we did nothing wrong
4482984 we were filming views of bitola from a high point to include them in our movies about the first and the second balkan wars when two patrols arrived the policemen took our personal documents and started interrogating us
4482985 then they took the three of us to a police department and asked who we were where we came from and watched all the video and picture materials we had shot
4482986 later the bulgarian consul to bitola iliyan karamanov appeared and then they released us seizing ten of the pictures that threatened macedonias national security as they showed a secret base
4482987 it has never been my object to record my dreams just realize them
4482988 a huge number of people suffer from allergies and while hay fever for example is generally not life threatening allergy sufferers often also have asthma which can be deadly
4482989 we used a speech stressor test used in a lot of psychology research
4482990 basically the participants each appeared before a panel of several evaluators who supposedly were behavioral experts participants had to give a 10 minute speech which was videotaped and then are asked a series of math questions they had to solve without paper or pen
4482991 the whole exercise is a nice stress experiment in the laboratory
4482992 the wheals on a person who was moderately anxious because of the experiment were 75 percent larger after the experiment compared to that same persons response on the day when they were not stressed
4482993 but people who were highly anxious had wheals that were twice as big after they were stressed compared to their response when they were not stressed moreover these same people were four times more likely to have a stronger reaction to the skin test one day later after the stress
4482994 late phase reactions also occur in allergic asthma and can in the proper settings be potentially life threatening
4482995 the results of this study should alert practitioners and patients alike to the adverse effects of stress on allergic reactions in the nose chest skin and other organs that may seemingly resolve within a few minutes to hours after starting but may reappear the nest day when least expected
4482996 whats interesting about this is that it shows that being stressed can cause a persons allergies to worsen the next day
4482997 this is clinically important for patients since most of what we do to treat allergies is to take antihistimines to control the symptoms runny nose watery itchy eyes and congestion antihistimines dont deal with those symptoms on the next day
4482998 that means you will also have less drug reaching the normal tissue
4482999 the results are actually highly dependent on the surface chemistry
4483000 in other words you dont get this result just by attaching drugs to any nanotubes
4483001 right now what we are doing is so called passive targeting which is using the leaky vasculature of the tumor
4483002 but a more active targeting would be attaching a peptide or antibody to the nanotube drug one that will bind more specifically to the tumor which should further enhance the treatment efficacy

4483009 a not to be missed metal day with none but the best bands in the middle east after years of poorly organized gigs weak management and mediocre bands
4483010 the first part of the course as far as the indian ocean wont necessarily be very quick until we get to the south of vietnam the anemometer will rarely exceed 10 15 knots but as the wind gradually backs well be able to pick up the pace as we approach the java sea there arent likely to be any big surprises as far as the weather is concerned over the initial miles but the crew will have to be on their guard we noticed during our previous records that our passage across the china sea is likely to involve a number of encounters fishing boats and drifting nets dotted about everywhere in addition throughout our descent of the indian ocean were going to pass strings of islands land will never be that far away
4483011 in summer the monsoon flow kicks in over this part of asia the monsoons stem from the sely tradewinds of the southern hemisphere which are created to the east of indonesia having gained sufficient speed these tradewinds manage to cross the equator and as the coriolis effect changes direction they are deflected towards the right rather than the left later tracking round to the south and then the south west these winds end their long oceanic journey at the foot of southern china where they fuel the pluvial storm activity with virtually constant humidity over the hong kong region it is this headwind that gitana 13 is likely to have to tackle on starboard tack initially followed by further close hauled sailing on port tack as they approach the sunda strait which marks the entrance into the indian ocean

4483014 and even as late as a july 27th presentation at comic con internation henson company representatives including red fraggle herself stated that the fourth season was planned for release later this year
4483015 thank you for contacting us as of right now we are not releasing season 4 as a stand alone item it is only available as part of the complete series collection there are no plans at this time to release it alone
4483016 according to company spokesmen the current plan is to only release the complete series with no current listing on the schedule for the fourth season as a separate dvd needless to say fans and collectors are outraged by this news
4483017 i know you love me but why tell me why
4483018 but they didnt say if that was good or not so i turned away from them and then looked back again and said hey you smell of green olives and they smell good

4483028 we competed pretty well but their execution in these conditions under pressure was excellent they do it so well
4483029 it was a good performance especially the first half its hard to be critical of too much we did
4483030 i just need a break can i have this day off

4483033 im not going to stand here and turn my back on the people who sent me here
4483034 i studied one of the mummies the larger one back in 1979 and determined the blood group data from this baby mummy and compared it with my 1969 blood grouping of tutankhamun
4483035 the results confirmed that this larger fetus could indeed be the daughter of tutankhamen
4483036 this is a very important project as these fetuses have never been not fully studied
4483037 the mummy was subjected to x rays in 1978 and a number of skeletal malformations were observed
4483038 i did publish a paper with harrison and others in which we suggested sprengels disease however recently i have concluded that the elevated clavicle was simply a result of manipulation of the baby during mummification
4483039 the lineage and the family of king tutankhamun particularly his parents
4483040 ive sat down with roque and weve had a chat and the lad is happy to stay at blackburn rovers
4483041 it annoys me because i think there are clubs out there who are trying to unsettle my players and its not something that im happy about
4483042 the likes of roque and steve warnock theyre all staying i dont want to sell my best players unless i want to sell them and roque and steve are two definitely two players that i dont want to sell and they definitely wont be sold
4483043 theyre staying as far as im concerned thats the end of the story
4483044 robbies done well his last game was october last year thats a long time ago hes trained ever so well and hes getting his sharpness back
4483045 some of the things hes done in the last three or four days in training have been mind blowing hes still got it and he could be a very good asset for us if we decide to take him on
4483046 ill sit down with robbie next week and the chairman and well make a decision from there
4483047 both santa cruz and ince knows the truth he wants to join bentley at spurs
4483048 its such a great club and there is the chance to fight for the championship and win cups here
4483049 when you join a club like rangers you cant expect anything but to win things
4483050 its time for that to change everyone here wants to be champions again and to bring happiness to the fans
4483051 i know the game in england and the uk already so im already used to the british game
4483052 he is a really good all round midfield player and he will help us a lot
4483053 hes very good technically and i hope he will come and improve us
4483054 he can get a goal or two as well so if all goes well he will be a good acquisition for us
4483055 pedro is the type of midfielder who controls a game he never hides he likes to get on the ball he looks for possession and he never wastes it either he has great awareness he makes the team tick
4483056 he isnt a prolific scorer but he has got a great shot and when he scores it is usually from about 20 to 25 yards out his goals are usually very important as well he is a very much big game player
4483057 i have heard rangers are looking for somebody to fill in for barry ferguson while he is out injured pedro will certainly be able to do that as long as his team mates give him the ball
4483058 leave me alone dont get me mixed up with those guys
4483059 in january july 2008 340 cases of israelis both right and left wing disturbing the peace were opened compared to 313 cases in the parallel period last year
4483060 this was a meeting one of many held by the precinct with other entities with which police are in routine contact such as the idf so we have no intention of commenting on things said in internal discussions
4483061 the idf performs its role in cooperation with the police and shin bet
4483062 irregularities uncovered in police or soldier performance are handled appropriately

4483064 because she takes care of the home there are virtually no honey do lists to hand over
4483065 the level of growth of repossession orders suggests that we are on track for a repossession crisis very similar to the early 1990s
4483066 it is absolutely vital that the government should intervene and require a proper code of conduct to be implemented by mortgage lenders
4483067 this should not just apply to the big banks but to the large number of secondary lenders who are using court action to pursue their debts in a very aggressive way
4483068 the council for mortgage lenders code of conduct should be put on a statutory footing for all repossession actions
4483069 he betrayed families by claiming hed abolished boom and bust and encouraging a spend now pay later culture
4483070 now times are getting tougher thousands are losing their homes because they can no longer make ends meet
4483071 lenders must now act responsibly even if our prime minister has not done so to minimise the number of people losing their homes
4483072 whilst we are not seeing repossessions on the same scale as the early 1990s we are making sure the right advice and support is available for the minority of borrowers who may need it at the moment because of global economic pressures
4483073 as well as expanding free legal representation in county courts for households at risk of repossession we are providing more free debt advice and are working closely with lenders to ensure that repossession is only ever a last resort
4483074 these services can make a real difference with more than 80 of repossessions avoided when they are used it is important that families who have concerns seek advice at the earliest opportunity starting by speaking to their lender
4483075 police say it was a fleeting conversation but one that may be crucial
4483076 of course not but what your face and heart said on that day spoke much louder than what came out of your mouth i knew then that you and it was then i became to love you like a son
4483077 joe i didnt give my cow to you i gave it to god do you think i would do that for you
4483078 where do you think i got them joe god delivered them to me three weeks after you left
4483079 the belief that there is a substantially real self and the cherishing of ones own interest at the expense of others are the two main thoughts and emotions we have nurtured within us through our many lives but what is the result of this we are continually suffering and experiencing negative thoughts and emotions so our self cherishing hasnt really got us very far also if we shift our focus from ourselves to others and to the wider world and if we turn our attention to all the crises in the world all the difficulties and the sufferings and so on we will see that many of these problems are direct or indirect consequences of undisciplined negative states of mind
4483080 conservativism a general state of mind that is averse to rapid change and innovation and strives for balance and order while avoiding extremes
4483081 nothing except that new foreign girl with the alien accent who pumped me for the secret whereabouts of the super duper top secret anti employer meetings i dont think i told her it was in the basement of dunkin donuts

4483090 la iglesia cat lica es un gran negocio basado en la figura de jesucristo y en toda la parafernalia de v rgenes santos y ngeles
4483091 es para decirles esta es tu iglesia por qu la aceptas as como est por qu te dejas explotar y ver la cara para que pidan que su iglesia se purifique porque se ha convertido en una cueva de ladrones de pederastas y de abusadores de las mujeres
4483092 lo m s hip crita que hay en el mundo es el catolicismo vaticano
4483093 hablan de proteger la vida y no les importa que miles est n muriendo de sida a diario adoran a mar a y no permiten el sacerdocio de las mujeres atacan la homosexualidad y la mitad de ellos son homosexuales est n contra el aborto pero obligan a las monjas que han sido violadas por curas a abortar
4483094 la iglesia cat lica ha dejado de ser cristiana no sigue a cristo se ha dedicado solamente a conservar el poder y a hacer dinero
4483095 mi mam estar a feliz si yo hubiera llegado a obispo hubiera sacado de la pobreza a toda la familia
4483096 me baso en los estudios de max weber quien demostr que los pa ses protestantes son los que m s han progresado social y econ micamente porque inculcan el valor del trabajo por ejemplo en cambio el catolicismo se basa en la ignorancia de la poblaci n
4483097 esto es un impuesto que debe pagar todo el mundo
4483098 y entonces yo le pregunt y por qu la iglesia no paga
4483099 dicen que m xico es un pa s cat lico pero yo lo dudo si realmente hubiera un sentimiento religioso una pr ctica religiosa m xico estar a mejor porque todos los criminales se dicen cat licos porque las prostitutas se dicen cat licas todo mundo es cat lico cu l es la diferencia
4483100 cuidado con la iglesia que se me est alineando con ciertos grupos y partidos pol ticos cuidado porque la oligarqu a los pelucones tambi n tienen sus curitas
4483101 si hay curitas conservadores que desde el p lpito dicen esa mentira sobre el supuesto totalitarismo del gobierno p rense y digan padre usted es un mentiroso usted no tiene derecho a hacer eso usted es un actor pol tico est traicionando su rol de pastor
4483102 lean los derechos de la constituci n el estado garantizar la vida desde su concepci n qu mayor garant a que eso compa eros nosotros defendemos la vida parad jicamente muchos de los que se rasgaban las vestiduras y se opon an al aborto eran quienes propon an la pena de muerte y ah la iglesia no dijo esta boca es m a hay un curita en los ceibos ani adito que en todos los sermones me critica qu pena que no sepa guardar su puesto de curita con mucha mala fe con mucha peque ez de alma nos critica y utilizando el p lpito

4483105 si te pregunto por las mujeres supongo que me har s una lista de tus favoritas puede que hallas echado unos cuantos polvos pero no puedes decirme que se siente cuando te despiertas junto a una mujer y te invade la felicidad si te pregunto por el amor me citar s un soneto pero nunca has mirado a una mujer y te has sentido vulnerable ni te has visto reflejado en sus ojos no has pensado que dios ha puesto un ngel en la tierra para ti para que te rescate de los pozos del infierno ni que se siente al ser su ngel al darle tu amor darlo para siempre y pasar por todo no sabes lo que se siente al perder a alguien porque s lo lo sabr s cuando ames a alguien m s que a t mismo dudo que te hayas atrevido a amar de ese modo

4483107 people living together should not assume that they will automatically have the same rights as married couples or civil partners
4483108 in court there is no such thing as a common law marriage
4483109 i think the mll has done a great job aligning with these great charities over the years its going towards a great cause
4483110 i gladly sent my money off to special olympics its definitely needed there at special olympics more than with me for playing in an all star game
4483111 since the first day i met her shes been an inspiration
4483112 shes touched me in many ways every time i see her she is smiling and happy she and i are very close
4483113 stinkin thinkin and what about the wisdom to know what you can change and what about if you keep doing the same things youre gonna get the same results
4483114 the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feeling and expression lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects
4483115 the chinese name of the theme tune you and me is
4483116 im okay with it my voice was used in the performance i think thats enough
4483117 for hate is strong and mocks the song of peace on earth good will to men
4483118 god is not dead nor doth he sleep the wrong shall fail the right prevail with peace on earth good will to men
4483119 there is still cope for copper prices to fall another 10 or so part of that is function of chinas growth slowing
4483120 oh god this cant be real oh god what do we do
4483121 oh god only love is real oh god i am open to what is mine to do
4483122 regardless of which partys nominee wins it is vitally important that we the people let him or her know that we expect governance based on prinicples of love and compassion not on fear and destruction and that this governance starts with a serious look at how we are spending our money
4483123 all have sinned and come short of the glory of god
4483124 we cannot get a right understanding of the relation that the manifest bears to the unmanifest until we set clearly before ourselves the character of original being so long as we think of god in terms of personality just so long shall we fail to understand the relation existing between humankind and god
4483125 this does not mean matter because matter is formed while god is the formless the substance that god is lies back of all matter and all forms it is that which is the basis of all form yet enters not into any form as finality it cannot be seen tasted or touched yet it is the only enduring substance in the universe
4483126 the life and intelligence permeating the universe god within us forever resident in the invisible side of humankinds nature
4483127 god above or beyond gods universe apart from it god is more than gods universe
4483128 being itself must be masculine and feminine in order to make humans in its image and likeness male and female
4483129 we are saying god as father and god as mother
4483130 divine law is the orderly workingout of the principles of being or the divine ideals into expression and manifestation throughout creation divine law cannot be broken it holds humankind responsible for the results of its labors
4483131 grace is attunement with law in its perfect working simply the truth of be ing that which we are
4483132 the unchangeable life love substance and intelligence of being principle does not occupy space neither has it any limitations of time or matter it eternally exists as the one underlying cause out of which come forth all true ideas
4483133 god is personal to us when we recognize god within us as our indwelling life intelligence love and power there is a difference between a personal god and god personal to us since the word personal sometimes leads to misunderstanding it would probably be better to speak to god individualized in humankind rather than of god personal to humankind
4483134 all of a sudden i felt very uplifted more uplifted than i had ever been i remember i knew timelessness and spacelessness and lightness i did not seem to be walking on the earth the most important part of it was not the phenomena the important part of it was the realization of the oneness of all creation a oneness with that which permeates all and binds all together and gives life to all a oneness with that which many would call god
4483135 god is the good and all things that proceed from him are good
4483136 from the revolutionary concepts of relativity and the logic defying paradoxes of quantum mechanics an ancient paradigm is emerging in vague forms we begin to glimpse a conceptual framework in which each of us shares a paternity in the creation of physical reality our old self image as impotent bystander one who sees but does not affect is dissolving
4483137 the distinction between the in here and the out there upon which science was founded is becoming blurred scientists using the in here out there distinction have discovered that the in here out there distinction may not exist

4483143 they were happy that they didnt have to get other peoples smoke in their hair and clothing

4483171 rhetoric should be a study of misunderstanding and its remedies
4483172 how does a word mean how does an idea or an image mean what it does
4483173 morpheme two or more words are said to share a morpheme when they have at the same time something in common in their meaning and something in common in their sound
4483174 business to guess at and diagnose the mistakes other people have made in understanding what they have heard and read and to avoid illustrating these mistakes
4483175 the meaning we find for a word comes to it only with respect to the meanings of the other words we take with it
4483176 the word book for example troubles no one and yet compare the use of book in which we distinguish a book from a magazine or journal with that in which a majority of speakers in england describe a weekly as a book or compare the senses of book in its a formidable volume but its not a book he has a mind full of his book writing a book binding a book printing a book rearranging the books in the catalogue in each of these we have shifted the sense of book sometimes to positions incompatible with one another
4483177 the return to rhetoric had begun in the 1930s when proponents of new criticism began to connect the importance of ambiguity as a characteristic of language to a reconsideration of rhetoric as the explanation of ambiguity
4483178 safety is our primary concern always with the development of any new treatment
4483179 they didnt explain to the parents that this was an experimental vaccine and a lot of the parents who signed consent forms were illiterate
4483180 in some cases they first gave them the vaccine and then gave them a 13 page consent form to sign that i had to read three times to understand
4483181 while legal authorities investigate were in an observation phase to see if everything happened as expected or if there were deviations that caused damage in this case the death of seven kids
4483182 this is the first baby step for christopher neil in terms of having him held accountable for the international sex crimes he is accused of committing
4483183 the world will be watching to see if there is the political will to continue on with this case
4483184 this body has little to do with bigfoot and everything to do with a sasquatch costume that someone developed after watching too many gorilla movies
4483185 the teeth that seem to have been placed in the mouth could be my late mothers false teeth
4483186 ive had interactions with tom biscardi in the past and based on that history i would say that anything he is involved in is suspect
4483187 it just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
4483188 it showed a side of her that made her very human
4483189 but think that this was so soon in the marriage she was having grave doubts but so was he the separation was initiated by him
4483190 does he not care about the future of their relationship
4483191 until the end the whole thing didnt seem real to him he didnt think anyone would be interested he didnt think wed get a publisher i dont think he thought that far ahead
4483192 we always thought we were fraternal until we took a dna test
4483193 so while wmg continues to reduce staff and scale back compensation for its employee base its senior management continues to carry on as if the music industry was in its heyday this simply cannot help morale at wmg
4483194 if theres not continued access of humanitarian supplies if civilians are not protected if they are limited in where they can move its something that could develop into a crisis
4483195 these people are running out of places to go and basic necessities
4483196 the tigers are keeping them in harms way and the government is not doing enough to ensure they receive essential assistance
4483197 its in hibernation and its been in hibernation for some time and its probably in decline
4483198 its natural for the prime minister to come here these people died for the country
4483199 the ldp realized that focusing on ideological issues is not a vote winner they saw what happened to abe
4483200 all these bread and butter issues are what they have to focus on
4483201 if japan hadnt taken control of other countries in asia then those countries would be european colonies today
4483202 although we have also been affected by the global economy we are optimistic because our economy is still growing over 6 percent per year for the last eight quarters and the first quarter of this year we still grow at 6 4 percent and so we are cautious but we are optimistic about the situation
4483203 we are upbeat that our records show that we have been able to go after the terrorist activities terrorist cells and etcetera
4483204 the president also warns that there is always a possibility of attack from terrorist but we are determined to make sure that any terrorism based on whatever reason they may be we will go after them we will destroy them
4483205 i think the sentence is a bit light he should face a harsher sentence because he has committed a crime against a child
4483206 we are looking to the court to ultimately impose a total sentence in the case that improves on past responses to this serious national regional and international problem
4483207 prosecution of child sex offenders in the east asia pacific region continues to be low and sentences do not reflect the gravity of the crime
4483208 you cant understand how a woman seeing a man who has been separated from his wife rosetta getty for months can cause such a scandal its awful i cant tell you you wonder when its all going to stop
4483209 they forced me to the floor dragged me manhandled me into a restaurant next door
4483210 there will be no restrictions on journalists in reporting on the
4483211 chinese reporters recently reported of a 21 point directive that came down last month from the central propaganda department
4483212 not the republic of china taiwan were also on the list but no mainland chinese reporter really needs to be reminded of that
4483213 i think sen gramm would be in serious consideration for ambassador to belarus although im not sure the citizens of minsk would welcome that
4483214 the court considers that the defendants are still in the courts jurisdiction because the defendants had surrendered to authorities and the court had granted them bail
4483215 the court still has jurisdiction to proceed with the case and there is no reason to dismiss the case
4483216 the via epia n700 nano itx board has been specially developed to excel in space constrained environments while offering an extensive feature set based around the via vx800
4483217 through listening carefully to customers were confident that weve made the via epia n700 as user friendly as possible
4483218 we are in the market for a striker and made a substantial offer which has been well documented
4483219 this pay offer is an insult to professional hard working men and women who have to operate in extremely difficult conditions we will not stand back and allow labour costs to determine whether contracts are won or lost
4483220 swissport is aware of the disappointing news that a small number of union members have voted for strike action at gatwick airport swissport is working with the airport operator and the customer airlines to minimise disruption to the travelling public
4483221 some would say that justice is the answer and indeed we should always seek justice
4483222 however we know that in a flawed and broken world complete justice is hardly ever experienced
4483223 we do not live in a world where we can experience absolute justice with justice as with so many other things in life we frequently have to settle for something less than the absolute
4483224 some would say that justice is the answer and indeed we should always seek justice however we know that in a flawed and broken world complete justice is hardly ever experienced
4483225 we do not live in a world where we can experience absolute justice with justice as with so many other things in life we frequently have to settle for something less than the absolute it is far from easy to recognise that fact

4483359 de inhoud van het akkoord en de spoed waarmee beide partijen het hebben getekend laat geen andere conclusie toe dan dat het project in werkelijkheid tegen rusland gericht is

4483361 just wasnt something that i wanted im a social person and i needed something else
4483362 i was never an a student i just went through the day once i started at mcool i started to care about my school work
4483363 now that i am able to do a good job it makes me feel capable that i can do more
4483364 its a demanding curriculum and the students have to be self motivated self disciplined and willing to ask questions
4483365 for example a student sitting in a classroom can start daydreaming and miss what was happening but when taking a class online things dont happen until the student engages things to move forward
4483366 its flexible and there are no distractions or other people around you
4483367 mcool gives me the opportunity to go at my own pace
4483368 for whatever reason math makes more sense to me online than it did sitting in a classroom
4483369 im not sure why but it just makes more sense learning and seeing the problems on the computer
4483370 i like being in the classroom and around people in the high school but i also like having more time to do my work in the online classes and have the time to work on my assignments
4483371 i have seen such a huge improvement in her self esteem and her grades have improved so much
4483372 hij kan mensen maken en breken en dat doet hij dan ook
4483373 walgelijke machtspolitiek waar ik op geen enkele manier meer mee geassocieerd wens te worden
4483374 met deze rotterdamse incidentenpolitiek zou groenlinks zich niet meer moeten inlaten
4483375 van heemst wilde praten hoewel ik op het punt stond om met mijn vrouw en vier kinderen op vakantie te gaan we zaten thuis midden in de voorbereidingen en dat heb ik hem laten weten mijn gezin heb ik de afgelopen twee jaar enorm verwaarloosd maar uit zijn dreigende en hier en daar zelfs wat intimiderende smsjes bleek dat ik geen keuze had we moesten en we zouden praten voordat ik weg zou gaan dat is gebeurd op dinsdagmiddag om twaalf uur op het stadhuis daarbij waren ook mijn fractievoorzitter anneke verwijs en mijn collega wethouder jantine kriens van de pvda aanwezig maar wat als een gesprek was aangekondigd bleek een mededeling te zijn uitgesproken door van heemst hij zag het niet meer in me zitten ik moest weg binnen een half uur was het zogenaamde gesprek voorbij voor zover ik zelf al een beslissing had kunnen of had willen nemen had de pvda die al voor mij genomen
4483376 dat bleef tamelijk vaag het was allemaal wel duidelijk zo vond hij kennelijk heb ik in zijn ogen te veel steken laten vallen maar als er n partij is die mij voortdurend heeft tegengewerkt is het zijn pvda wel voortdurend moest ik verantwoording afleggen voortdurend plaatste men kanttekeningen zonder zelf oplossingen aan te dragen zoals met de inburgeringscursussen iedereen weet dat de huidige wet totaal onwerkbaar is en dat die nu niet voor niets wordt aangepast toch heb ik de inburgeringsklassen weer vol gekregen dat was niet dankzij de pvda maar ondanks de pvda
4483377 ja maar men had ineens ook zon haast dat was ook veelzeggend kort na de mededeling van van heemst belde burgemeester opstelten hij was inmiddels op de hoogte verrassend snel mag ik wel zeggen opstelten wenste me sterkte en een goede vakantie dat kon ik wel waarderen uitgerekend die dag was zijn vader overleden kort daarna moest ik mee met de gemeentesecretaris want ook die wilde alles snel afhandelen waarom al die haast vroeg ik nog op 26 augustus ben ik terug dan kunnen we die formele zaken toch ook nog wel regelen maar nee dat kon niet ik was het zat en wilde naar huis zijn handtekening staat daarom onder mijn ontslagbrief
4483378 dat wilde ik zelf niet bepaalde fatsoensnormen houd ik namelijk w l in acht ik heb bewust even afstand willen nemen om alles te laten bezinken maar sindsdien is er zo veel gezegd en geschreven dat het nu tijd is dat ik mijn verhaal vertel zodat ook mijn partijgenoten weten wat er achter de schermen is gebeurd
4483379 dat heb ik uitgelegd als een gebrek aan steun ik vind het zwaar teleurstellend maar de vraag is of groenlinks de coalitie wel trouw blijft woensdag komt de partij bijeen ik baal ervan daar niet bij te kunnen zijn maar als ze het mij zouden vragen dan zeg ik terugtreden en wel onmiddellijk met de incidentenpolitiek onder aanvoering van de pvda zou groenlinks zich niet meer moeten inlaten dat schaadt het aanzien en de geloofwaardigheid van onze partij wat bestuurskundige pieter tops onlangs vaststelde is waar het ontbreekt rotterdam aan elan en scherpte de stad rent van incident naar incident dat heeft te maken met de nervositeit van de pvda die partij voelt zich gemangeld tussen de sp en leefbaar rotterdam de laatste maanden is dat toegenomen vandaar dat zenuwachtige gedrag van veel pvdaers
4483380 woede teleurstelling irritatie van alles een beetje maar ook opluchting speelt een voorname rol blij dat ik geen deel meer uitmaak van deze goedkope manier van politiek bedrijven het is misschien niet zon passende vergelijking maar toch ik voel me een gastarbeider die twee jaar lang de hete kolen uit het vuur heeft mogen halen op het moment dat we gaan oogsten word ik bruutweg aan de kant geschoven dat zijn kennelijk de omgangsvormen twee jaar lang mocht ik het linkse smaldeel binnen deze zogeheten brede coalitie vertegenwoordigen en alle bijbehorende beledigingen van leefbaar rotterdam incasseren nu pas ik niet meer in het plaatje van van heemst hij is met achttien zetels de grootste en dus heeft hij het laatste woord hij kan mensen maken en breken en dat doet hij dan ook echt walgelijk ik heb er geen ander woord voor
4483381 ik had soms wat duidelijker en overtuigender kunnen zijn let wel k nnen niet m ten het beleid klopte wat je er ook van mocht vinden zie de nu weer gevulde inburgeringsklassen zie de extra miljoenen voor kunst en cultuur het enige is dat ik niet bedreven ben in het spelen van slinkse spelletjes maar dat wil ik ook niet ik noem geen namen maar ik had ook wel wat meer steun verwacht van de andere collegeleden
4483382 never say never luidt het spreekwoord maar op dit moment zegt mijn gevoel onder geen beding in zon zieke sfeer weiger ik te opereren wat ik ga doen weet ik nog niet misschien pak ik mijn oude beroep van bedrijfsarts wel weer op nu wil ik eerst bijkomen van alle emoties
4483383 een persoonlijk drama en dus is het logisch dat hij verbitterd is

4483388 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4483389 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4483390 it is being presented like a thief in the night with lack of full transparency and it is being launched under dark clouds
4483391 the timing is very tight remember we still have the fuel rice and food crisis the tuition crisis the transport crisis and we still have the milf crisis in mindanao it will not be good to divide the country with the issue on constitutional change and there is the massive suspicion that it is being done to prolong the presidential term of gma president arroyo
4483392 the shift to a parliamentary government the shift to a federal system is something crucial and urgent and something positive needed by our people
4483393 i have been fighting for a parliamentary system for 15 years for a federal system for the last nine years you know about my role
4483394 i have sacrificed whatever little popularity i have i sacrificed my position where i went up and down the country in the last three years trying to fight for a shift to parliamentary government and a shift to a federal system but i think the best is to present this constitutional amendments and reforms before our people before the congress of the philippines before a constitutional convention con con elected for the purpose after the 2010 elections
4483395 but you need a lot of preparations otherwise you will have chaos confusion division and conflict
4483396 it should be presented after the 2010 elections after the expiration of the term of president arroyo
4483397 we are very pleased with the tremendously successful launch that we had
4483398 but this is where the real journey starts for age of conan in the months ahead we will be putting a lot of effort into expanding and improving on the game and we look forward to using the games convention to unveil some of the locations content and features we have in the pipeline
4483399 we are on a lot more companys radar screens they realize elgin is a great place to do business

4483402 we have engaged a search consultant who has identified about a dozen suitable office properties along the i 90 corridor and we have determined that downtown elgin based on a number of factors including the available incentives could possibly be a great location for us

4483415 the national hurricane center indicates that this system does not have a well enough defined center of circulation to be considered a tropical depression environmental conditions are favorable for development and i expect the national hurricane center to classify this system a tropical depression at some point today or at the very latest on saturday
4483416 all indications are this morning that this system is very very close to being classified as a tropical depression
4483417 in fact i would not at all be surprised to see reconnaissance aircraft to find a tropical storm when they investigate this afternoon
4483418 there is no closed circulation yet but a depression could form any time
4483419 the upper level winds are becoming more favorable for development
4483420 it will be interesting to see how this affects this system down the road what is interesting is that even though several tracking models track this system over the mountainous parts of northern hispaniola it still ramps the storm up to a very strong hurricane once it is in the bahamas
4483421 one model even forecasts it to track into the northwestern bahamas early next week and stall there for 36 hours or so before tracking back to the west and tracking over south florida on wednesday night and thursday morning before tracking into the gulf of mexico and tracking west northwest across the entire gulf of mexico before coming ashore on the central texas coast on august 28 13 days from now
4483422 one thing that is very interesting to note is that several tracking models keep this system fairly disorganized and weak over the next 24 to 36 hours but once it moves away from the land influences of hispaniola and cuba it is forecast by the intensity guidance to really ramp up in strength
4483423 they didnt find the closed circulation that they would need to make it a depression
4483424 if it goes over hispaniola the circulation will be severely disrupted there will be a lot of flooding down there but this thing will not be intensifying as quickly as it could if it was over open water
4483425 it could just get steered right off our east coast but there is still that possibility a couple of the models with the high up there want to bring it back to central florida or even into the gulf of mexico eventually

4483431 we feel confident were doing excellent work and wed like to not have that hanging over our head
4483432 but we just need to keep focused on what our task is even though weve improved its still not acceptable that only 35 of fifth graders are reading proficiently

4483436 we will do what is commercially appropriate and what is prudent i dont know of any legislation that says that the reserve bank actually sets interest rates for commercial operations in this country
4483437 there are always options for indirect interventions that increase competition and that put more regulatory pressure on the banks
4483438 now i wouldnt speculate about what they might be and of course its not my direct responsibility but well cross that bridge if and when we come to it if we believe that the banks are not doing the right thing then clearly we will be examining the options to put greater pressure on

4483566 the level of growth of repossession orders suggests that we are on track for a repossession crisis very similar to the early 1990s
4483567 it is absolutely vital that the government should intervene and require a proper code of conduct to be implemented by mortgage lenders
4483568 this should not just apply to the big banks but to the large number of secondary lenders who are using court action to pursue their debts in a very aggressive way
4483569 the council for mortgage lenders code of conduct should be put on a statutory footing for all repossession actions
4483570 he betrayed families by claiming hed abolished boom and bust and encouraging a spend now pay later culture
4483571 now times are getting tougher thousands are losing their homes because they can no longer make ends meet
4483572 lenders must now act responsibly even if our prime minister has not done so to minimise the number of people losing their homes
4483573 whilst we are not seeing repossessions on the same scale as the early 1990s we are making sure the right advice and support is available for the minority of borrowers who may need it at the moment because of global economic pressures
4483574 as well as expanding free legal representation in county courts for households at risk of repossession we are providing more free debt advice and are working closely with lenders to ensure that repossession is only ever a last resort
4483575 these services can make a real difference with more than 80 of repossessions avoided when they are used it is important that families who have concerns seek advice at the earliest opportunity starting by speaking to their lender

4483621 the small pandas those less than 1 year old huddled together at the top of the trees
4483622 undergraduates get a much better education at claremont than at stanford where we emphasize graduate training
4483623 you cannot sit there with a straight face and tell me that ryan theriot is 16
4483624 he looks 13 maybe 14 and he keeps asking me to buy him beer and cedeno they say he cant grow facial hair because of a skin condition yeah right more like a lack of puberty condition
4483625 we have all the necessary documentation to prove that our players are at least 16 years old
4483626 sure the documents were issued by us and are printed with crayon on the inside of a pop tarts wrapper but theyre totally legit
4483627 the two of them have been terrific in pre season and it was a tough decision last week to start with diego
4483628 ive mentioned before that when you sign players others then really take their game to another level because they see the competition and they want to make sure theyre in the team and thats happened
4483629 diego didnt do a lot wrong last saturday maybe could have done better with the fourth goal although he was probably unsighted when he came out
4483630 it was always in my mind to play brian in the cup tie anyway
4483631 as it was he stood up and showed what he did in pre season so then that gives you a selection dilemma for want of a better phrase
4483632 its one well look at and decide who we feel is the best to take the jersey for the game
4483633 every decision is tough when youre leaving players out because they all want to play but you can only do it honestly and thats the way well go about it
4483634 for me its a terrific boost to have clarke back
4483635 i think when hes focussed and at it then i really believe hes as good a centre back as youll get in the championship
4483636 thats up to clarke to show that on a consistent level but he brings a tremendous presence leadership qualities always talking and organising and hes going to be an important player for us
4483637 i think hes got the full package and he knows because ive sat down with him and had extensive chats with him such is the relationship we have and i really believe hes capable of being a top top championship player
4483638 but clarke has to bring that to the game when he crosses that white line
4483639 its a nice dilemma to have that players are pushing for places because theyve done well in a game as opposed to making decisions on the back of players playing poorly
4483640 id rather have it that way and long may that continue
4483641 its fair to say clarke comes into your thoughts and well deliberate and pick the best team to go forward
4483642 touch wood weve got a full compliment to train and choose from were just looking to go and try and beat a very good ipswich side who by all accounts were very unfortunate to lose at home to preston last week
4483643 so far for me its been a case of taking two steps forwards and one back
4483644 the season before last was very good but im honest to say that last season wasnt good enough for me
4483645 i was not happy with that the last third of the season was okay i got some goals and was starting to get back to old ways
4483646 but i want to score goals i want to be in the penalty box and doing things because i know i can be a danger in there if i get the right balls
4483647 and maybe i can score some more goals from set pieces im looking forward to that
4483648 but i have to work hard and hopefully i can achieve a little bit more this year
4483649 they have got some good players and theres no easy games in the premier league
4483650 players are a strange breed just when you think youve got to know them and you think youve cracked it it turns around and bites you on the backside
4483651 we just take each game as it comes and the one thing we do want is the energy they displayed at wolves we need that every game
4483652 we need them to come off the pitch after every game with with their tongues hanging out and their muscles aching like they did on tuesday
4483653 its a long season weve got another 45 games and in every game we play if we show the commitment that we showed at wolves we could find ourselves in a more favourable part of the league
4483654 thats our first goal to make a steady improvement we would like to make bigger steps than we have in the previous two years
4483655 its going to take a lot of hard work but we have got a bit of quality in our squad and were looking to add to that
4483656 we drew blank on saturday and we scored two on tuesday against a championship side and thats something weve got to address
4483657 possibly by the letter of the law he had to go but i think time was actually up when it happened
4483658 i know jon moss the referee at wolves has blown up when weve had a corner before now at home in stoppage time
4483659 but in terms of our squad thats a load of nonsense we are totally focused
4483660 with any manager change theres going to be different ideas and changes brought to the table
4483661 but everybody is enjoying it if you watched us train you would see us all with smiles on our faces we are really looking forward to tomorrows game
4483662 he ince has a presence about him which gets through to the players hes a charasmatic person
4483663 obviously as a player youve got to have that distance from the manager
4483664 but hes very professional in his job he knows what he wants when he talks to the players and knows whats needed from us we want to do well for him
4483665 the biggest thing that strikes me about the last four managers ive had is that theyve all been succesful as players
4483666 graeme souness steve bruce mark hughes and paul ince were all very succesful
4483667 if they all had a game of tennis im sure they would be exactly the same they would want to win and thats what they are like as managers
4483668 they are no different they are all very ambitious with a good work ethic and want to get results
4483669 for anybody who has played in those great liverpool and manchester united teams youve got to have a real hunger and desire to win games and win leagues i think that will carry on for him
4483670 in the last couple of seasons managers have got jobs in the premier league without the apprenticeship of working with lower league teams
4483671 but certainly with the gaffer hes done that at macclesfield and mk dons it was a good appointment
4483672 just by being here you feel the energy of it
4483673 the vas deduction will deactivate from today and no refund of money will be given to you
4483674 yeah thats the whole point of it were not doing this to do a one off were definitely gonna do cr e fest 2 next year hopefully well continue it whether we play or not its kind of like ozzfest was its a lifestyle thing
4483675 remember we toured in 05 and 06 we didnt get back together for this tour we only took a year off just like anybody sometimes you need time away from everybody weve been together for what 26 years 27 years something like that ive been friends with tommy lee drums for 30 years any kind of relationship that long youre gonna get on each others nerves and you do need a break from each other
4483676 very sorry for any inconvenience but we will be there at some point
4483677 the urgency got away some when we found out they had actually called from newcastle
4483678 we had so many unknowns if were going to direct our resources we need to know more information so we know where to direct those resources
4483679 they drove to newark to call 9 1 1 and tell the young mans father they couldnt find him
4483680 by the time we got the call it was 10 or 11 oclock and too dark to search we found him the next afternoon
4483681 we left it open until daylight or until more information came in
4483682 we wanted to make sure we didnt need to go back out there that no one was actually missing
4483683 people who have been drinking have no business in the water
4483684 they should absolutely call us if someone is in trouble and wait for us to get there to show us where the person was last seen
4483685 our priority in a situation like this is the safety and well being of the person in the water or the person reported missing versus the concern that a witness or the caller may have been drinking
4483686 we dont want someone not to call because they have been drinking even if theyre underage
4483687 they were frustrated and asked if anything else could be done that night and the answer was no
4483688 various manchester city officials have been advised on a number of occasions that the player would not be for sale
4483689 we are very disappointed therefore that they have continued their interest
4483690 its very important that we keep everyone who is here at the moment
4483691 weve built up a very good squad over the last few seasons and i would like to see everyone remain here

4483711 in fact its just not even logically possible for it to be aimed at russia given how russia could overwhelm it the purpose of missile defense is to protect our european allies from any rogue threats such as a missile from iran

4483802 on the surface cattle producers are unlikely to notice any differences in the new evaluation
4483803 under the surface however there are some distinct differences especially for breeders and commercial users of lim flex genetics
4483804 during its 40 year history in north america upgrading of limousin breed composition chiefly has occurred from angus based animals
4483805 so more accurate accounting for past and present day angus genetics also will enhance predictions for purebred and fullblood limousin animals
4483806 no other multibreed genetic evaluation in the world more thoroughly incorporates performance information from two populations of animals as does agis work for nalf
4483807 the epds and index predict genetic rankings among animals and they are the most accurate predictors of genetic merit

4483810 we wanted to work with a pasture that was representative of common kentucky pastures which is always going to consist of some tall fescue orchardgrass clovers and a host of weeds
4483811 what we are discovering is cattle are performing somewhat differently depending on how they are raised with goats
4483812 when goats graze first and then the cattle come in they are doing what we call cleanup grazing in the pasture at the end of the first grazing season we found cattle that followed goats weighed on average 30 pounds less than cattle that were grazing with goats all the time
4483813 goats have a huge diversity of other plants to choose from than ones we would normally consider traditional forages like fescue orchardgrass white and red clover etc
4483814 so its been very interesting so far and we are learning about some things that wed like to pursue with follow up research but this is a great start
4483815 this is actually the third year the goats have been on the farm here and youd be very hard pressed to find multiflora rose here
4483816 i dont know that its a permanent fix but while the goats are here they do prefer it so its been good to see reduced weed growth out here
4483817 weeds are always a challenge on the farm and the goats have definitely made a difference on this farm multifora rose and tall ironweed were significant on this farm before they came here
4483818 the fencing requirements for goats are far greater than those of other livestock
4483819 there are a lot of things to be considered when fencing particularly with steep terrain where labor is often very challenging
4483820 at first they just ran all over the place but they are teachable
4483821 now they just follow the mule an all terrain vehicle and its a lot easier as for the water we finally had to go with city water so wed be sure to have enough
4483822 i think weve got a very unique opportunity for livestock producers in the state who are just wanting to get into goat production or those folks who are into beef cattle and are thinking about adding goats to their farm either as a source of income or weed control or some other management aspect
4483823 what really matters is expenditures what a household can and does spend
4483824 if bill gatess income goes to zero he could still live a pretty good lifestyle spending his billions
4483825 its just wrong they should be able to do that they should be able to give you a warning first
4483826 move lively you animals stow that ammo boy and get your shit together
4483827 all right kids you heard the man now move your sweet behinds into the dropship we depart in t minus 10 mark now
4483828 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4483829 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4483830 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4483831 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4483832 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4483833 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4483834 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4483835 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4483836 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4483837 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4483838 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4483839 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4483840 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4483841 these were the ghostbusters girls that one i grabbed her ass cause i wanted to see what her reaction was
4483842 whats policy and method of dealing with complaints about harassment
4483843 but what im asking is more hypothetical and informational if there is a set comic con policy on harassment and physical and verbal abuse on con attendees and exhibitors and if so whats the specific procedure by which someone should report it and specifically where should they go
4483844 comic con has zero tolerance for harassment or violence against any of our attendees or exhibitors please report instances to a security guard or the con office in room xxx

4483961 there are a lot of background talks going on whereby a way is trying to be found so that there is no impeachment
4483962 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4483963 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4483964 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4483965 these unsubstantiated spate of reports are totally baseless and malicious
4483966 once they issue impeachment proceedings against him and issue a charge sheet then it will become almost inevitable that he will want to answer those charges
4483967 he feels very strongly that a lot of that is being said is not correct
4483968 we have conveyed to them that the coalition is determined for impeachment and if he wants to save himself the best way is for him to quit
4483969 if a person moves to the side we are not in the habit of bothering him this would not be a good attitude if someone is lying on the ground and we go aggressively against him

4483979 we feel sorry for the 300 million americans whod have seen the swimming live on seven in australia
4483980 the problem for seven in this instance is because beijing is so close to the sydney timeline thats the good news because audiences go through the roof
4483981 and because its so close to sydney time thats the bad news for seven because they cant win people are thinking i know fred smiths swimming at 10 30 and theyre waiting at 10 30 for that race
4483982 i dont know that anyone knows the speed at which its going to happen because weve badly predicted it all the way along and we havent got it right
4483983 and here unfortunately people hold on to economic models as long as they possibly can whether its advertising or the tv industry and the consumers are going to say weve had enough of that theres options now
4483984 here when a channel pays so much for the rights it has to protect the rights and its not going to be able to do that much longer certainly it wont be the case in london
4483985 in theory every event should be able to be seen live in 2012
4483986 its going to be an interesting four years because the ioc wants to continue to sell the rights and the consumer is expecting they wont have to pay for it by looking at advertising so this whole model could be turned upside down in four years
4483987 broadcasters should be thinking deeply about what else they can add to those rights
4483988 there will be increased hours in all areas i cant quantify that at this stage but there will definitely be increased hours whether its on free to air subscription tv or mobile
4483989 a lot will change before 2012 but the fundamentals of viewing are probably still pretty sound

4483991 the linking of delivery to hand held devices will be the big thing in 2012

4484006 interpretation of the general welfare clause is not inconsistent with original understanding because there was no clear understanding on that point during the founding madison had one view hamilton another
4484007 structure relates first to the internal relationship among the various provisions of the constitution and second to the overall design or framework of government that the constitution establishes
4484008 candidly and admirably concede that originalism is actually of little help in explaining their hostility to a number of cases on their list
4484009 it is the law that governs not the intent of the lawgiver
4484010 applying original intent begs several questions which drafters or ratifiers are authoritative how do we know their intent how are differing views among the drafters and ratifiers to be resolved

4484019 they are angry that the employers want to lock them into 2 5 increases for the next three years while inflation is way ahead of that already and set to continue rising
4484020 the 2 5 pay offer is already a pay cut
4484021 people are already struggling to keep on top of mortgage repayments and rent rises but this pay offer will see our members suffer a huge cut in their living standards

4484038 were electing a president not a national pastor i dont see what good it will do for the american people to again hear the candidates spout pious platitudes about their favorite bible verses or how devout they are
4484039 candidates should appeal to the voters based on their qualifications for office and their stands on the issues not their religious beliefs
4484040 this event continues the campaign spiral into religious matters americans want to hear the candidates views on important issues such as constitutional rights public education the iraq war and the economy
4484041 why should one of these important events be orchestrated entirely by only one pastor who comes out of one narrow segment of our diverse country

4484092 the answer is remarkably simple the same gene that causes men to like men also causes women to like men and as a result to have more children
4484093 the positive effect of an x linked gene on female fecundity tends to outweigh the negative effect of the gene on male fecundity
4484094 we understand that the genetic component has to interact with something to produce different phenotypes

4484135 you were riding on the pavement neither of you had a helmet and people nearby who saw what was happening realised immediately that what you were doing was obviously very dangerous

4484165 i dont care since that is why we are here
4484166 the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one
4484167 his objectives are clear they go beyond detaching south ossetia and abkhazia from georgia and absorbing them into russia they go beyond destroying the georgian army leaving the country at russias mercy the real objective is the finlandization of georgia through the removal of president mikheil saakashvili and his replacement by a russian puppet russia says it will not talk to saakashvili thus regime change becomes the first requirement for any movement on any front this will be putins refrain in the coming days he is counting on europe to pressure saakashvili to resign and or flee to give peace a chance the finlandization of georgia would give russia control of the baku tbilisi ceyhan pipeline which is the only significant westbound route for caspian sea oil and gas that does not go through russia pipelines are the economic lifelines of such former soviet republics as kazakhstan and azerbaijan that live off energy exports moscow would become master of the caspian basin subduing georgia has an additional effect it warns russias former baltic and east european satellites what happens if you get too close to the west it is the first step to reestablishing russian hegemony in the region
4484168 what is to be done lets be real theres nothing to be done militarily what we can do is alter putins cost benefit calculations we are not without resources there are a range of measures to be deployed if russia does not live up to its cease fire commitments 1 suspend the nato russia council established in 2002 to help bring russia closer to the west make clear that dissolution will follow suspension the council gives russia a seat at the nato table message invading neighboring democracies forfeits the seat 2 bar russian entry to the world trade organization 3 dissolve the g 8 putins dictatorship long made russias presence in this group of industrial democracies a farce but no one wanted to upset the bear by expelling it no need to the seven democracies simply withdraw and if italys silvio berlusconi who has been sympathetic to putins georgia adventure wants to stay he can have an annual g 2 dinner with putin then immediately announce the reconstitution of the original g 7 4 announce a u s european boycott of the 2014 winter olympics at sochi to do otherwise would be obscene sochi is 15 miles from abkhazia the other georgian province just invaded by russia the games will become a riveting contest between the russian belarusan and jamaican bobsled teams all of these steps except dissolution of the g 8 which should be irreversible would be subject to reconsideration depending upon russian action most importantly and minimally its withdrawal of troops from georgia proper to south ossetia and abkhazia
4484169 the most crucial and unconditional measure however is this reaffirm support for the saakashvili government and declare that its removal by the russians would lead to recognition of a government in exile this would instantly be understood as providing us the legal basis for supplying and supporting a georgian resistance to any russian installed regime president bush could cash in on his close personal relationship with putin by sending him a copy of the highly entertaining and highly fictionalized film charlie wilsons war to remind vlad of our capacity to make russia bleed putin would need no reminders of the georgians capacity and long history of doing likewise to invaders

4484176 for many will come in my name saying that i am the christ
4484177 the time is coming when people will not tolerate sound and wholesome instruction but having ears itching for something pleasing and gratifying they will gather to themselves one teacher after another to a considerable number chosen to satisfy their own liking and to foster the errors they hold and will turn aside from hearing the truth and wander off into myths and man made fictions
4484178 i determined not to know anything among you except jesus christ and him crucified

4484220 the first half of 2008 has continued to be a challenge to the entire alternative fuels industry in all markets however it is our firm belief that the global opportunities for clean burning renewable fuels have never been greater and timelier despite the challenges o2diesel continues to provide optimum near and long term solutions to many of the problems being encountered globally with the need to improve air quality and reduce our dependence on oil the balance of 2008 should see many of the projects we have begun over the past several years maturing the development of o28 for the u s air force has continued to move forward and we expect to conclude the final testing and to obtain a decision on their wide scale use of this fuel by late summer or early fall in europe the tests conducted at veolia transit have as anticipated gone very well as evidenced by their press conference in april our efforts in south america continue as we seek greater market awareness in paraguay and colombia as part of our effort to streamline our operations and cut our overhead we have continued to execute cost saving measures throughout the organization by remaining focused on commercial implementation via strategic partnerships with companies that will help support the costs of developing our target markets while participating in the economic benefits our progress in this area has allowed us to reduce operating expense for the first half of the year by nearly 40 and we fully anticipate expanding this strategy into new untapped markets

4484222 the belief that there is a substantially real self and the cherishing of ones own interest at the expense of others are the two main thoughts and emotions we have nurtured within us through our many lives but what is the result of this we are continually suffering and experiencing negative thoughts and emotions so our self cherishing hasnt really got us very far also if we shift our focus from ourselves to others and to the wider world and if we turn our attention to all the crises in the world all the difficulties and the sufferings and so on we will see that many of these problems are direct or indirect consequences of undisciplined negative states of mind

4484395 brian mildenberg is being vilified when he should be applauded for courageously taking on a difficult case out of a sense of professional responsibility
4484396 one of the most insane obscene and disgusting things ive heard in all my public life
4484397 my primary concern is to get the record straight and try to communicate the facts of this case
4484398 and understand they may not recover money damages in the end
4484399 i can be a fan of jay and still rip him limb from limb and still be a fan after i finish him off im still going to listen to reasonable doubt afterwards im going to make him mad enough to where he has to say something

4484401 it is as absurd to argue men as to torture them into believing
4484402 if a white person is a self proclaimed nerd i e millinerd all jokes around the topic are essentially their opportunity to say that they are smarter than you
4484403 the anatomy of a blog makes serious conversation all but impossible
4484404 blogging is as melancholic and illusionary as don quixote tilting at windmills
4484405 the breezy style is often the work of an egocentric the person who imagines that everything that comes to mind is of general interest and that uninhibited prose creates high spirits and carries the day
4484406 ive been able to come back into my daughters life and that was an adjustment anyway because im an alcoholic and its the first time weve really been able to share
4484407 every now and then ill stay if we have something early in the morning we have to do
4484408 it made no sense for that trial to proceed so we worked out an agreement
4484409 the agreement says that on oct 1 well probably get another overnight and that will stay in place until the end of the year or the end of the conservatorship
4484410 kevin has a wonderful heart i dont agree with giving him more money he wants them to raise these kids together kevins heart is right
4484411 i would hope that it stands until the end of the year and then well sit back and evaluate where we are at the time where britney is at that time
4484412 its wonderful its new for both of us she sometimes calls me 50 times a day and asks me things that light my life up but like all daughters she is very manipulative and cunning so she gets what she wants a lot
4484413 one day an expert in religious law stood up to test jesus by asking him this question teacher what should i do to inherit eternal life
4484414 ive only raced her three or four times in the past but each time i remember how she went out faster
4484415 i kind of got it into my head her race strategy it gave me more experience to race against her knowing where she was going to pick it up and where i needed to be
4484416 i have to send that surgeon a thank you note
4484417 it took six or eight months for her to come back from that and obviously shes better than ever now
4484418 i would always have her wear a heart rate monitor just to keep an eye on the problem her heart rate would get well up over 240 when she had incidents and the problem when she had an incident was that she would be exhausted for two or three days after that wed have to get her out have her take deep breaths and calm her down shed then continue to train at a very low level so the operation was absolutely the breakthrough moment for her and since shes been doing a steady climb
4484419 that was one of the highlights of the meet for me
4484420 to know youve won and won by that much over such a rival and great world record holder is a pretty special moment
4484421 its literally just metal against metal hopefully the shredder wins
4484422 it literally beats that material until it falls through those grates
4484423 this operation will literally clean the area up for 60 75 miles
4484424 i received information that a car a white hyndai was in the area at the time the fire occurred
4484425 i grabbed a blanket from my car so one of the men could put it over his face as he went back in
4484426 but the floor was too hot they couldnt go back inside
4484427 we saw the flames and stopped to see if we could help
4484428 we just went over to see if we could be of any assistance
4484429 i dont really know their names just know they were neighbors
4484430 i just went to the quickest driveway i could get to
4484431 ive got to catch him i dont want him to walk up here and just find out his mothers dead
4484432 they were all the time out working in the garden
4484433 its like a big puzzle the pieces fit but how do they best fit
4484434 thats one of the great things about the site theres plenty of property without cross pollinating the students
4484435 in my wildest imagination i didnt think they would throw at my players coconut
4484436 it was a lack of respect on the part of the american coach to say that
4484437 the cuban team respects the game and respects our opponents and is incapable of doing that
4484438 its very rare to get three riders on the form of their life on the same day and thats what happened today
4484439 maybe the british had a different method of work and preparation than us
4484440 we knew we could get a place between two and five so third is good
4484441 i dont really want him to go for the record he is here for three golds but if it happens it happens
4484442 i just wanted to step on it in the first 50 a little bit and try and get out to an early lead
4484443 for ryan to come back 20 minutes later and just miss us going 1 2 thats an incredible day for him
4484444 so cutting that in half is going to be interesting
4484445 im used to it the biggest part for me is the psychological part just getting ready for one race and then being able to separate that race and go into the next one no matter what the outcome is you got to separate it and just move on
4484446 ive spoken all week about how much ive enjoyed the olympic experience how much i love the spirit of it
4484447 thats a disappointing way to exit the tournament when you not only lose the match but you lose a little faith in your fellow competitor
4484448 playing in the olympics in whats supposed to be considered a gentlemans sport thats a time to call it on yourself
4484449 fernando looked me square in the eye and didnt call it
4484450 i mean its just one point there is an umpire if im 100 percent sure about it i mean i will give it but im not sure
4484451 whatever is going to get him to have some sleep tonight then thats fine
4484452 we needed to be more dynamic we needed a bit more personality on the field of play
4484453 i thought midtjylland were excellent a big strong team who understood the counterattack game very well
4484454 i just think she played the match of her life
4484455 but nothing like this especially against a player like me
4484456 they just wanted to help me push me a lot
4484457 maybe the law of averages if i play him enough hes bound to have an off day against me once
4484458 i cant be more elated that it happened at the olympics
4484459 a conversation with the governor amp lt governor candidates 2008 election issues of the african american community
4484460 this can be attributed to the large increase in production of mainly maize and to a lesser extent wheat for cereals and cassava for roots and tubers
4484461 talks are underway and many people are interested that the issue is settled amicably without going into the impeachment of president pervez musharraf
4484462 his close aides approached the government and were clearly told that the only way to avoid impeachment is to step down the government does not want him to remain in the presidency
4484463 totally baseless and malicious recent spate of unsubstantiated news reports and rumours being spread that president pervez musharraf was resigning
4484464 they are just trying to put pressure on him to quit but he is not going to quit
4484465 the other hotels around the area all have health care that is provided by the boss and have been able to get wage increases
4484466 at the other hotels in the same classification for the same work the workers get paid 2 to 3 an hour more
4484467 clearly were disappointed that unite here local 681 has spent more time protesting
4484468 publicity stunts are not productive and are extremely disruptive to the resort district
4484469 disneyland is being unfair with us because were fighting for our health care and theyre trying to take it away
4484470 theyre trying to cut our hours and take away our seniority
4484471 the most important is health care we need that and they want to take it away
4484472 at the end of the day what it means is that workers are going to be priced out of health care
4484473 we do remain hopeful that we can reach an agreement thats both fair and equitable providing that union leadership is reasonable and realistic in its approach

4484487 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4484488 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4484489 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4484490 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4484654 although the index declined in july certain fluctuations in confidence are to be expected in an ever changing economy and job market
4484655 with a local economy that is so heavily influenced by the manufacturing and automobile industries the rising cost of fuel is appearing to hit home as workers across the country react to high energy costs it is somewhat surprising to see that ohio workers are more likely to make a job transition in the next 12 months with almost half of ohio workers considering a job change employers will benefit from reevaluating their current recruitment and retention strategies in order to accommodate this mobile workforce and prevent a loss of talent
4484656 given the current state of the economy we are encouraged that the employee confidence index remains stable
4484657 as we move ahead into the third quarter the texas job market continues to be in a good position in terms of positive job growth when compared to the rest of the country the demand for skilled workers remains strong despite the ups and down of the economy we believe that most people regardless of what side of the job market theyre on are maintaining a wait and see approach at the moment employers as well as job seekers remain cautiously optimistic and i dont foresee this trend fading anytime soon

4484705 why didnt they just repeat seventeen over and over again or release a 55 minute version of seventeen
4484706 when color was new vintage photographs from around the 1970s
4484707 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
4484708 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
4484709 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters know is who uses that language for what purpose
4484710 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
4484711 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
4484712 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
4484713 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
4484714 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
4484715 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
4484716 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
4484717 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
4484718 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
4484719 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
4484720 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
4484721 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
4484722 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
4484723 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
4484724 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
4484725 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
4484726 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
4484727 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
4484728 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
4484729 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
4484730 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
4484731 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
4484732 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
4484733 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
4484734 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
4484735 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
4484736 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
4484737 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
4484738 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
4484739 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
4484740 we are on a lot more companys radar screens they realize elgin is a great place to do business
4484741 elgin is an ideal location to do business live and raise a family
4484742 its something thats working we have a lot of inquiries from businesses that are relocating
4484743 we have engaged a search consultant who has identified about a dozen suitable office properties along the i 90 corridor and we have determined that downtown elgin based on a number of factors including the available incentives could possibly be a great location for us

4484753 it is not the anti zionist part to which i object but the anti semitism
4484754 anti semitism is confined to nazis if you are not a nazi you can not be an anti semite
4484755 it is a rare phenomenon to find even jews expressing themselves in an anti semitic and anti zionist manner and ms hecht galinski is a leading representative
4484756 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
4484757 jerome corsi is a discredited liar who is peddling another piece of garbage to continue the bush cheney politics he helped perpetuate four years ago
4484758 his is just one of what will likely be many more lie filled books rushed to print this election cycle which are cobbled together from debunked internet sources to make money and advance a partisan agenda we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means at our disposal
4484759 if obama takes pains to hide his smoking from us what else does he take pains to hide
4484760 im putting this question forward im putting the evidence forward voters can make up their own minds
4484761 it is a very sad thing that nowadays there is so little useless information

4484782 de blob was the eye opener for us that we can make cool games and function as a good team the game definitely gave us the opportunity to start our own company
4484783 we always dreamed of designing an rts and when wii ware came out we immediately figured that this was our chance
4484784 were trying really hard to finish two weeks before rosh hashanah

4484787 our congregants are thrilled to know theres an option for getting meat
4484788 we need to change all the equipment too everything we have butchering equipment shelving everything
4484789 were getting a lot of phone calls people say were sorry and how can we help but really i dont see what i can ask from people were trying to do everything ourselves when we get to a wall and cant climb it then maybe well seek some outside help
4484790 last season we had a staggered start tevez and anderson joined us and werent 100 percent fit ronaldo got suspended for three games after the first game then rooney got injured in the first match against reading and was out for three games
4484791 by the time we got everyone focused and fit we then went on a fantastic run with our consistency and really good football
4484792 id prefer to get a good start we want that but we are also able to go the long distance
4484793 in terms of attacking options we are down to the bare bones a bit
4484794 but the backbone is with the midfield players and defenders and there is good variety there
4484795 hopefully that is enough to get us through the first game against newcastle which is always a good exciting game they will always have a go newcastle
4484796 we need to start well and get off to a flyer and just keep winning
4484797 man united have a few tough games early on we need to focus we have a good home record and if we can continue that and get off to a good start well be all right
4484798 hes probably one of the best ive ever trained with or played against
4484799 he looks awesome he has a great touch opens up defenses and can pass the ball he gets stuck in as well which i like about him
4484800 he makes it look so easy and is a class act when you see him day in day out you realize how determined he is
4484801 unfortunately they did not perform in the way we needed last night
4484802 but we will see an improvement at the weekend we need to step up to the plate and become more dynamic it is important we show a bit more quality on the ball with the right pass at the right time
4484803 were in the market for a new striker as everyone knows
4484804 if that is a permanent deal or another loan signing well have to see you can read into it however you like
4484805 wir sagen nicht zu allem ja und amen und werden klarmachen was wir nicht mittragen

4484808 i stand on the first tee and i just feel comfortable
4484809 everybody has golf courses where you just look down there and you cant see anything
4484810 to be so far away from things its hard to grasp
4484811 its good when the manager speaks highly of you but i know we have a lot of quality midfielders
4484812 if i can get in it would be great but i will just concentrate on motherwell and doing well here
4484813 it would be great to play for scotland i was in berti vogts squad for his first match against france but i didnt get on and after that i was involved in a couple of b squads
4484814 it has all been a good experience and i would love to play for my country
4484815 we were poor on monday but if i were to throw out the lads who did not do well then we would be left with about four players
4484816 there may be one or two but they will have more to do with my approach to the celtic game than anything else
4484817 we have had a very frank discussion about how we can improve and i believe we can be better on sunday
4484818 these lads have done well for me since i came here and there were others who were making their debuts
4484819 we didnt really get the flowing football that we normally get but we will get better as the weeks go on i am sure of that
4484820 at least this is a match that will see us refocus pretty quickly as our concentration level cant be anything less than 100 percent
4484821 in the meantime the old rights based progressivism in indigenous political thinking had a few more years to go before a relentless decline in the standard of living and safety of people in aboriginal communities forced so many of us to ask an appalling question why did this descent into a seriously dysfunctional state seem to coincide with liberal progressive policies based on the rights agenda and the creation of new degrees of community autonomy the taboo on raising this was finally broken by an avalanche of evidence no one could ignore
4484822 the issues now included welfare dependency community autonomy organisational corruption the future of the aboriginal and torres strait islander commission frontier history wars racially differential morbidity and life expectancy poor school attendance declining literacy and numeracy substance abuse violence against women child sexual abuse customary law as a criminal defence staying in versus leaving versus orbiting in and out of the ghettos service mainstreaming gang warfare and public rioting the entry permit system and restrictions on media access the future of funding for remote settlements and the imminent expectation of rocketing urban migration by aboriginal people leaving failing outback communities
4484823 we have tended to be protective of the people with whom we have worked to the point where the recent descent of so many places into dire conditions seems almost scientifically inexplicable
4484824 truth is not necessarily a good uniter of people fictions or simplifications so often better bind us at least for a time
4484825 there are no signs to suggest that we will not be ready by 2011 one of our goals is to speed up uptake and use of information and communications technologies icts among south africans
4484826 digital television applications have an important role to reach especially rural regions effectively for interactive solutions it is in the interests of both government and its citizens that we accelerate uptake and use of icts
4484827 a google search for obama and anti christ returns an incredible 900 000 hits
4484828 rather than being dominated by rural farmers tropical deforestation now is substantially driven by major industries especially large scale farming mining and logging
4484829 although this trend is pretty scary its also much easier to target a handful of globalized corporations than many millions of poor farmers living on the frontier
4484830 it is easier for pressure groups to target corporations and enterprises rather than tens of millions of poor farmers who are simply trying to put food on the table for their families
4484831 i think what jeremys getting at and i apologize for putting words in your mouth jeremy is that if there is a business problem to be solved we should be avoiding solving technical problems especially when theyve already been solved well

4484844 theres been a bit of a disconnect between what the medical literature says about nutrition and what you get served in the hospital
4484845 buy meat and poultry raised without nontherapeutic antibiotics use milk produced without recombinant bovine growth hormones and replace unhealthy snacks found in many vending machines with healthy choices
4484846 food has biochemical benefits beyond just calories having the freshest food available to preserve the bioactivity of those nutrients is very important for healing sick patients
4484847 fresher tastes better and is associated with increased consumption of fruits and vegetables
4484848 our meats and dairy products are free of chemicals our luncheon meats are nitrate free and we serve as much organic produce as possible
4484849 the hospitalshould be setting a standard of nutrition for the community
4484850 food is absolutely an important factor in accelerating the healing process
4484851 the food service is part of hospital room and board so there is no additional cost depending on the type of food or the way it is served
4484852 as hospitals look at their budget the nutrition service is such a small piece of the overall hospital budget
4484853 in general we have patients who gain weight during treatment because they say the food is so good

4484855 before starting at the gazette searls worked for several newspapers in west virginia including stops in beckley morgantown bluefield and welch as well as memphis and johnson city tenn he was the morgantown correspondent for united press international as a boy searls sold papers for the west virginia hillbilly
4484856 he knew more about west virginia political history than anyone ive ever known
4484857 he was an old fashioned reporter and excellent newsman he really went after things and people respected what he wrote

4484871 our study reveals potentially clinically relevant differences in the gene expression of different cancer types and represents a reference framework for interpretation of smaller scale functional studies
4484872 this segregation of tumors into three groups with distinct expression patterns is surprising clearly the developmental trajectory provides a meaningful background for capturing large scale differences in gene expression across diverse conditions
4484873 shifting our focus from single sets of genes or processes to the biology of aggregates on the order of the entire transcriptome is likely to be useful in establishing highly robust molecular correlations between seemingly unrelated disease phenotypes

4484879 in concentrating on my upcoming races and prep ive declined every chance to comment on what people are referring to as disappointing results from the canadian team thus far in keeping with that i will only say that if one looks beyond medal counts and phelpsian standards of success youll see a lot of incredibly talented young canadians who deserve your support and gratitude for trying their absolute best
4484880 weve seen some awesome results one just needs to educate themselves a little on the circumstances of the competition

4484883 this invasion has probably eaten deeply into russian operations and maintenance funding to say nothing of its war reserve stockpiles of ordnance and equipment russia must have bet on a short and fairly bloodless war because it cannot afford militarily or politically a protracted slog not only doesnt it have the equipment to do so but it doesnt have enough highly trained troops to sustain heavy casualties the russian military consists of a small diamond hard point on the end of a wooden stick if the point shatters or wears down you are left fighting the stick

4484902 careless drivers put themselves and others at risk every time they get behind the wheel of a car despite good progress in recent years to reduce the number of people killed or seriously injured on the uks roads more can be done to prevent the unnecessary loss of life the introduction of this legislation will hit home the message that driving is a hazardous activity that requires total concentration allowing distractions to affect your standard of driving is not acceptable and will now be more appropriately punished under the law

4484971 allah pencipta langit dan bumi dan bila dia berkehendak untuk menciptakan sesuatu maka cukuplah dia hanya mengatakan kepadanya
4484972 sesungguhnya misal penciptaan isa di sisi allah adalah seperti penciptaan adam
4484973 allah lah yang memulai penciptaan makhluk kemudian mengulanginya menghidupkannya kembali maka bagaimanakah kamu dipalingkan kepada menyembah yang selain allah
4484974 maka siapakah gerangan yang dapat menghalang halangi kehendak allah jika dia hendak membinasakan al masih putera maryam itu beserta ibunya dan seluruh orang orang yang berada di bumi semuanya
4484975 dialah yang awal dan yang akhir yang zhahir dan yang bathin dan dia maha mengetahui segala sesuatu
4484976 maka patutkah kamu mengambil pelindung pelindungmu dari selain allah padahal mereka tidak menguasai kemanfaatan dan tidak pula kemudharatan bagi diri mereka sendiri
4484977 adakah sama orang buta dan yang dapat melihat atau samakah gelap gulita dan terang benderang apakah mereka menjadikan beberapa sekutu bagi allah yang dapat menciptakan seperti ciptaan nya sehingga kedua ciptaan itu serupa menurut pandangan mereka
4484978 allah adalah pencipta segala sesuatu dan dia lah tuhan yang maha esa lagi maha perkasa
4484979 allah sekali kali tidak mempunyai anak dan sekali kali tidak ada tuhan yang lain beserta nya kalau ada tuhan beserta nya masing masing tuhan itu akan membawa makhluk yang diciptakannya dan sebagian dari tuhan tuhan itu akan mengalahkan sebagian yang lain maha suci allah dari apa yang mereka sifatkan itu
4484980 dan pada sisi allah lah kunci kunci semua yang ghaib tak ada yang mengetahuinya kecuali dia sendiri dan dia mengetahui apa yang di daratan dan di lautan dan tiada sehelai daunpun yang gugur melainkan dia mengetahuinya pula dan tidak jatuh sebutir bijipun dalam kegelapan bumi dan tidak sesuatu yang basah atau yang kering melainkan tertulis dalam kitab yang nyata lauh mahfuzh
4484981 jika allah menghendaki niscaya dia musnahkan kamu wahai manusia dan dia datangkan umat yang lain sebagai penggantimu dan adalah allah maha kuasa berbuat demikian
4484982 kemudian mereka mengambil tuhan tuhan selain daripada nya untuk disembah yang tuhan tuhan itu tidak menciptakan apapun bahkan mereka sendiri diciptakan dan tidak kuasa untuk menolak sesuatu kemudharatan dari dirinya dan tidak pula untuk mengambil sesuatu kemanfa atanpun dan juga tidak kuasa mematikan menghidupkan dan tidak pula membangkitkan
4484983 allah lah yang meninggikan langit tanpa tiang sebagaimana yang kamu lihat kemudian dia bersemayam di atas arsy dan menundukkan matahari dan bulan masing masing beredar hingga waktu yang ditentukan allah mengatur urusan makhluk nya menjelaskan tanda tanda kebesaran nya supaya kamu meyakini pertemuan mu dengan tuhanmu
4484984 dialah yang menjadikan bumi sebagai hamparan bagimu dan langit sebagai atap dan dia menurunkan air hujan dari langit lalu dia menghasilkan dengan hujan itu segala buah buahan sebagai rezki untukmu karena itu janganlah kamu mengadakan sekutu sekutu bagi allah padahal kamu mengetahui
4484985 sesungguhnya dalam penciptaan langit dan bumi silih bergantinya malam dan siang bahtera yang berlayar di laut membawa apa yang berguna bagi manusia dan apa yang allah turunkan dari langit berupa air lalu dengan air itu dia hidupkan bumi sesudah mati kering nya dan dia sebarkan di bumi itu segala jenis hewan dan pengisaran angin dan awan yang dikendalikan antara langit dan bumi sungguh terdapat tanda tanda keesaan dan kebesaran allah bagi kaum yang memikirkan

4484998 having delivered more than 200 million pairs of replacement contact lenses to our customers world wide we can proudly say that we have never received a report from a customer identifying any health issue of any kind arising from the products we supplied consistent with this we note that no regulatory or professional body has ever identified any actual health or safety issues which they allege arose from the products we have supplied to our customers
4484999 prescription contact lenses may only be fitted dispensed and otherwise furnished to members of the public by a qualified eye care professional
4485000 by requiring a contact lens prescription and the involvement of an optician who is also a certified contact lens fitter and who must perform in accordance with the professional standards of practice of the college the public is assured that a professional will determine a persons suitability for the particular contact lenses by fitting them and then dispensing them and providing any necessary advice and follow up
4485001 prescription contact lenses are under no circumstances to be supplied to members of the public as if they were merely equivalent to an
4485002 poorly fitted and maintained contact lenses can cause abrasions ulcerations infections and potential loss of eye sight

4485029 im a monk i do not seek sensory or material pleasures and thus i eat as only much as needed for sustenance see im not much more than a leathery bag of bones quite an unsatisfactory meal id say do let me go unharmed after all harming me will not do you much good
4485030 no the monk is not concerned with sensory pleasures and thus he doesnt eat enough hes nothing but skin and bones
4485031 as for the prostitute shes a dirty dirty girl it would not be wise to eat her
4485032 i dont think youd want to eat me the monk and the prostitute are my parents

4485088 these types of game seem to be the only ones we play
4485089 we believe that the tournament is a great catalyst for developing the game in trinidad and tobago
4485090 obviously with claflins support the tournament will provide our basketball fraternity with the necessary international blend for this inaugural event
4485091 the special thing about this team is their willingness to stay focused and prepared at the same time this is a great opportunity for international exposure for our guys and to get revved up for the upcoming season we are honored to be chosen to participate in the inaugural trinidad and tobago hoops classic that means a lot and says a lot about the caliber of our basketball program
4485092 they are trying to grow the sport of basketball there and we are humbled that we have been asked to help them achieve that goal by being invited to participate in the inaugural tournament
4485093 we will be playing against some of the best athletes in trinidad and tobago at the same time they will get a chance to see what it takes to achieve success in basketball our guys have to be focused structured and know how to balance academics and athletics its not as easy as going on the court and shooting a basketball
4485094 once you start loving it its very hard to stop
4485095 claflin panthers to participate in trinidad amp tobago hoops classic
4485096 it takes you back to when you were a little kid playing on the playground outside all day
4485097 when youre younger you dont get as tired when you get on the court it takes its toll physically you can feel it the problem comes when you mentally make mistakes the first game was a little cooler than this its really hard the challenge is getting a second wind before the other team does
4485098 we had to make some strategic adjustments due to the humidity
4485099 we had to keep doing a lot of substitutions because of the humidity and we have more games coming
4485100 its almost like they see whats going on but have not been taught how to do it
4485101 they know about a 2 3 zone but dont understand how to execute its not so much they dont know the game theyve never seen it before and dont understand how to do it
4485102 the biggest thing is they all want to learn the game of basketball and are hungry and doing whatever it takes to promote basketball
4485103 its good for us to be able to assist them in accomplishing that goal the players are very athletic they just dont understand the structure of the game
4485104 for many years our university and the honors college have been very successful in recruiting nurturing and graduating a steady stream of students with extraordinary achievements and talents from trinidad and tobago
4485105 these students have enriched the educational experience for all of us here at claflin and we have empowered them to become confident visionary leaders for the world we take great pride in educating students prepared to compete in a global society
4485106 claflin university has prepared me to be a leader and to be able to serve in a multicultural global and technological society
4485107 i received individual attention and faculty mentorship i learned to pull my own weight
4485108 promoting the wonderful opportunities at claflin university to prospective students is the foundation of what we do everyday
4485109 having a chance to personally work with international students and their families in their own environment is a terrific opportunity for us we want to continue the tradition of attracting the best and brightest students internationally nationally statewide and locally
4485110 claflin university to host recruitment reception in trinidad and tobago
4485111 theres no other word to describe this experience the students came out the parents came out and educators here in trinidad came out seeking partnerships this was truly an awesome experience
4485112 you are doing something really really great for our students
4485113 the students are going to claflin and staying and they are graduating and they are happy
4485114 while we are student support services here in trinidad we do believe in helping students fulfill their full potential
4485115 and that means we need to recognize the need for studying not only in trinidad but also studying abroad because it is unthinkable to believe that any one country can help all citizens fulfill their true potential there are those who will need to travel abroad to be able to do that so we have no problems encouraging our young people to study abroad and fulfill their true potential
4485116 when you head to claflin they have this way of making you feel very at home its a very family oriented place and thats the biggest thing when you come
4485117 the second thing is there are a lot of opportunities you can grasp as a trinidadian student there are a lot of doors that will be opened to you there are a lot of opportunities you can grasp you just have to work hard
4485118 although its a small school you get known in the school and get known by teachers and its good for you because they know you on a personal basis
4485119 its a good place to be any one of you thinking about coming to claflin that should be your first choice
4485120 your hospitality has been second to none we invite you to send us your brightest the best of the best and just leave the rest to us
4485121 to expose the youth of the country of trinidad and tobago to sports such as basketball as well as other commonly enjoyed sports like cricket and soccer to encourage them to explore options to become a productive citizen
4485122 what we are trying to do is keep guns and crime down in the community we want to give these impoverished youth another outlet to be a successful person and we are doing this through sports
4485123 where are you going are you afraid of the rain
4485124 there is a need for us to help support this effort
4485125 we will see what balls we have and send them to you mr daniel

4485127 what does it take to be number one three is not a number two nobody remembers only one has the fun
4485128 it was so different to walk into the room and know now were getting ready for another season we talked about where we were where we are and where were going we talked about those three elements and making the challenge one of our challenges is we dont want them to mentally think we are in a preseason conditioning we want to stay away from that mindset were going to do a lot of game situations we are going to work on a lot of new strategies im glad to have them back this is my family
4485129 its definitely a release mentally in terms of the stress wondering whether were going to get in what stage we would be its definitely been mind boggling for everybody
4485130 the kids have been concerned it gives them a release and it opens a large variety of opportunities now because now we can compete in the postseason
4485131 it was a real burden off not only my teammates chest but my chest as well
4485132 as a freshman when i first got the news that we were going to ncaa it was really tough blow you come to school thinking youre going to compete and play in postseason play for the championship it makes you take a step back and evaluate yourself and your love for the game coach woodard staying on us and driving us everyday is what made the difference as an athlete any time you step on the court youre not playing for yourself youre playing for your teammates and youre playing for your institution when you think about that it drives you a lot more
4485133 theyve been very excited about us coming over there in terms of what the university has established outside the lines of athletics
4485134 we have a lot of students from that area that have attended and still are attending the university now theyll be able to relate to us from an athletic point of view also going over there will open up recruiting avenue it will be very good for us
4485135 i wanted our kids to be able to relate outside of their own culture
4485136 sometimes you have to learn how good you do have it its a great opportunity because i always tell them a role model to me is a person you can physically and personally touch at any given time for that moment for that week they can be outstanding role models
4485137 this is my first time flying and my first trip over seas
4485138 im very excited i expect us to go over there and i expect us to win i dont expect us to just go over there and have fun and just play i expect to win over there also mostly over there from what i hear theyve got the athleticism but they dont have the same skill sets like we do over here in the states i love interacting with different cultures getting to know different people i hope we meet the kids over there id like to teach them to do a little something on the court
4485139 a lot of d 2 schools dont get recognized for talent so its an opportunity for us to go out and show people that our schools can play too
4485140 its going to be a learning experience for us and them basketball may not be accepted over there but its a sport where everybody can play if you dont play you coach this is a great opportunity for us to go out and expand the game
4485141 the way we approach it this is not a light switch situation
4485142 we want the light to stay on were going to work extremely hard when we go out and play our plan is to beat you just like your plan is to beat us were going to stay with that same concept our biggest challenge is bringing our new people in and making them buy into the system our players have to be coaches and make the new players relate and believe in the system believe in the style and to believe in themselves if they can do that were in great shape
4485143 winning a national championship a siac championship thats our goal everyday
4485144 i dont think that a high expectation or a high goal my teammates and i come to play everyday
4485145 we got to where we were last season by working hard so well be alright
4485146 i want nothing but the best win a conference championship win the tournament and win a national championship
4485147 we call each other panthers we all talk and interact we have fun we joke and laugh with one another that just brings us closer the core of this team has basically been together for three years we went through the tough times of losing the year before last we struggled we won maybe nine games last year we started winning and winning brings happiness anyway this whole experience has just brought us together and made us stronger

4485214 im not running for the money im running for the glory
4485215 it wasnt as easy as i wanted it to be to qualify
4485216 i wanted to run outside and not to get boxed in
4485217 playing in the olympics in whats supposed to be considered a gentlemans sport thats a time to call it on yourself fernando looked me square in the eye and didnt call it
4485218 thats a disappointing way to exit the tournament when you not only lose the match but you lose a little faith in your fellow competitor
4485219 we know when it touches us and he knew that so thats where it comes into calling it on yourself because its the right thing to do
4485220 should i expect him to do that maybe not maybe i shouldnt expect people to hold themselves to high standards sportsmanship
4485221 but yes i did expect it a little more so in the olympics when were all competing under the banner of this event being to promote sportsmanship to promote goodwill amongst countries
4485222 that was heat of the moment stuff he hit it right at me
4485223 probably didnt want to hear an apology right away because i thought it was intentional when we changed sides he said sorry its part of the game you were on top of the game
4485224 i said okay thats fine its part of the game youre right move on and we did
4485225 i know him very well ive played him many times on tour he does everything in his power to win
4485226 usually its within the rules sometimes its bordering on gamesmanship
4485227 but hes too good of a player to do something like that and to act like that thats why its disappointing because he is a great player
4485228 i try to do it with integrity so my parents would be proud of the way i played
4485229 youd think that with young players like anderson ronaldo wayne rooney nani there will be improvement there
4485230 i think thats the most natural thing you can say about this club these players have the capacity to improve so well see
4485231 wayne is fit and the good thing he has done very well this week and has been progressing really well
4485232 we had quite a few opportunities last week that has to be said
4485233 we would have liked to have taken them and put the game to bed and if you dont take these chances in games that are close you can regret it
4485234 fortunately last week we were in control of the situation when it went to penalty kicks but we never looked as though we were going to lose it
4485235 but we have a good variety of midfield players and the back four are fit so we have a good foundation if we keep creating chances then we will start taking them
4485236 to beat the french by half a second made it exciting
4485237 it took every inch of effort to beat them as they have been invincible we had to put the pieces of the jigsaw together
4485238 anyone can say whatever they want i know for me i am clean
4485239 no game of baseball is worth that as far as im concerned
4485240 i want to run i want to hide i want to tear down the walls that hold me inside

4485283 amid increasingly loud complaints about spotty service and reports of potential hardware flaws on the 3g iphone apple had just two words for both its longtime fans and first time customers no comment
4485284 if there is a problem with a chip an iphone recall could be possible according to rob enderle an independent silicon valley analyst if its a chip problem those are going to need to come back he said i dont think theyll be able to fix the problem with a software update
4485285 it has the feel of a product that was rushed to market and went through testing too quickly he said
4485286 currently its unclear whether the problem lies with at amp ts network or apples handset
4485287 jupiter research analyst michael gartenberg characterized the problem as a minor one
4485288 spotty wireless broadband connectivity for some of apple inc s new iphones most likely results from a hardware problem introduced during mass production a swedish technical magazine reported wednesday ny teknik swedens foremost engineering weekly obtained a report on tests conducted by unnamed experts that showed some handsets sensitivity to third generation network signals is well below the level specified in the 3g standard
4485289 mark siegel a spokesman for at amp ts wireless unit said at amp t has not received a significant number of complaints and that overall the new iphone is performing just great on our 3g network in an interview siegel recommended that iphone 3g users sync the devices with apples itunes program frequently to take advantage of improvements that may come via updated software
4485290 connectivity is just the latest of apples problems with the iphone 3g
4485291 just hours before the new phones were set to go on sale users of the cupertino calif based companys old data synching service were locked out of their accounts when it took apple longer than expected to get the new version mobileme up and running
4485292 on launch day apples servers buckled as buyers tried to activate new iphones in stores while owners of older iphones and the ipod touch were updating and reactivating their devices at home
4485293 francis sideco a senior analyst for el segundo calif based research group isuppli corp said the connectivity problems described by users dropped calls and the low number of bars in particular could be caused by any of a number of parts from the phones antenna and amplifier and the radio frequency transceiver to the baseband that processes the digital signal and sends it to the speaker or screen
4485294 without knowing exactly what is going wrong sideco could not say whether software or firmware updates could fix the glitch or whether apple could be facing the possibility of a recall
4485295 ive been really surprised that people think its just a case of turning up and well beat stoke

4485297 we are hoping to bring in a couple of players we have to add more quality to the squad and we are working very very hard to do that

4485316 lucy is fighting for the freedom and democracy of tibet and is doing what she feels is right and what i feel is right obviously im worried any parent would be but i am certain that china would not resort to torture or abuse when the eyes of the world are upon them
4485317 i felt he was so passionate about it i couldnt say dont do it in fact i wholeheartedly backed him to do it he set out to achieve something and he has done that
4485318 we did this action today to highlight the chinese governments use of the beijing olympics as a propaganda tool they are whitewashing their human rights record on tibet so our action today shines a spotlight on those atrocities in march tibetans took to the streets risking everything in their calls for justice and human rights and we stand today with this action in solidarity with those calls
4485319 we are aware of reports of two british nationals being detained near the national stadium in beijing we are in touch with the chinese authorities and are requesting immediate consular access should this information be correct
4485320 people were always going to use the olympic games as a platform for their causes that happens at every olympics and everyone knew that could happen here
4485321 sport at the service of the harmonious development of man with a view to promoting a peaceful society concerned with the preservation of human dignity
4485322 tibetans shall be happy in tibet and chinese shall be happy in china
4485323 for thousands of years for a couple of thousands years at any rate tibet was a free and as fully in control of its own affairs as any nation in this assembly and a thousand times more free to look after it own affairs than many of the nations here
4485324 the athletes could be exposed to unhealthy air pollution unless there is a substantial reduction in emissions

4485326 i wouldnt expect a world record in the marathon in beijing
4485327 the issue isnt just air quality but the combination of heat humidity and bad air
4485328 many suffered from the bad air but hardly anyone said anything

4485330 these product enhancements are more evidence of the additional customer benefits we are creating through our collaboration with edelweiss air
4485331 edelweiss air is already well established in the swiss market and will now also be offering our swiss customers its top class product in the leisure travel field
4485332 american airlines continues to execute its fleet renewal plan to control costs while prudently reinvesting in the travel experience for customers
4485333 replacing md 80s with 737s at current fuel prices provides financial benefits while enhancing the customer experience
4485334 boeing and american airlines have enjoyed a partnership that spans more than 50 years back to the beginning of the commercial jet age todays announcement continues that long and successful history
4485335 these additional next generation 737s will enhance americans fleet with newer more efficient airplanes lowering fuel costs and lessening the environmental impact of flying
4485336 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
4485337 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies we are applying for eu u s antitrust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any u s or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
4485338 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry

4485342 we have given our feedback to the port of london authority and this is something we would like to make happen if the infrastructure was there we would have continued we are exploring how to go forward
4485343 the more liberal camp just assumes that pastor warren is going to make this a christian litmus test of the presidency others who are more conservative fear he is going to wimp out on some of the issues
4485344 he says neither group understands or knows me hes going to ask tough questions fair questions not gotcha questions
4485345 its a great way for him to do what he can to make connections with not only moderate evangelicals but also the many people out there who read the purpose driven life
4485346 you just wonder is he trying to shoot himself in the foot
4485347 the god strategy how religion became a political weapon in america

4485350 sterling is being hit on all sides at the moment with a broad based dollar rebound and the realisation that the uk economy is facing a very difficult period
4485351 hes the leading evangelical figure hes trying to craft a new direction a new image for evangelicals the fact that this is happening at saddleback not focus on the family makes it more neutral ground its an audience that both obama and mccain have a real shot at getting
4485352 take up the causes that are politically correct and dont want to take up issues that are controversial
4485353 we thank god for his emphasis but its interesting that the candidates are going to a voice that has been somewhat silent on the great foundational issues of abortion and marriage even though he would stand for those
4485354 we are in danger of losing this whole country to the secularism of europe
4485355 i dont see any conflict at all and if there was i wouldnt be a part of it
4485356 im focused on the same thing rick warren is focused on i think evangelicals must be talking about disease and poverty
4485357 i believe that pastor rick is going to ask a wide range of questions and i believe he will ask questions about issues of life efforts to redefine marriage the importance of family and other issues that are of concern to traditional evangelicals
4485358 i dont know how hard he will press its sort of a new role for him
4485359 no matter what you answer somebodys going to disagree with you
4485360 there are a lot of americans who feel disaffected by both the left and the right
4485361 using his influence to become the next jerry falwell or james dobson
4485362 if you dont just focus on those two issues if you say there are a variety of issues that ought to be of concern to evangelicals you can plausibly see evangelicals saying obama is better on the first three mccain is better on the last two
4485363 mccain and the republicans need to have evangelicals vote mostly on social issues
4485364 if they do that theyll vote mccain obama is a very strong candidate to appeal to moderate evangelicals he talks about his faith in a compelling way and appeals to them on poverty the environment and the desire for change
4485365 counter my convictions and the convictions of masses of believing americans
4485366 i think the church is in danger of a deception of being courted by senator obama
4485367 everybody has been talking and it is clear some newspapers and journalists and all our supporters know this blame me for everything global warming rises in petrol prices everything
4485368 in this case i want to be clear since i talked with martin oneill in april i didnt talk with anyone else at aston villa all the talks have been between rick parry and the owner and chief executive of aston villa and they have been pretty good
4485369 if someone wants to talk about barry in the future they will have to talk to the owner or chief executive of aston villa or rick parry i was not going to talks about barry i was not going to talks about xabi alonso and arsenal
4485370 sunderland have clearly signed some good players it is always tough to play away at sunderland because they have some quality players it could be a physical game but also a game with good football
4485371 we had some problems the other day with xabi alonso and yossi benayoun receiving dead legs and fabio aurelio and martin skrtel are improving so we will see this afternoon and then decide steven gerrard was training really well yesterday and he is okay
4485372 philipp degen is still injured but the rest of the squad is nearly there if we see the olympic players back soon itll be fantastic for the rest of the season
4485373 nils always recognises the norwegian guardsmen when they come to visit him
4485374 he loves the attention he receives at the ceremony and takes his time inspecting the troops
4485375 should there be a ban on pedestrian text messaging too
4485376 the filmmakers all had to confess to me that their mother hated me and my movies were banned in the house or they had traumatic experiences remembering me or they had nightmares where i visited them
4485377 sometimes i feel a little awkward like ive damaged their youth
4485378 i nagged my mom to rent it for me when i was 6 or 7 years old it definitely made an impression
4485379 working with freddy krueger himself was surreal it was pretty intimidating for me holy s its freddy krueger i had posters of him in my bedroom but we sort of all clicked on the movie buff level
4485380 we love to see slacker kids die almost as much as we love to see sluts kick the bucket quipped englund
4485381 it wasnt like a goal but ive accepted the mantle
4485382 the only person we would allow to come down and verify the body was the real bigfoot hunter tom biscardi
4485383 to the average person these places just seem like extreme wilderness where youll find lions and tigers and bears
4485384 the reality is that youre never more than a mile from a road
4485385 the picture is completely absolutely 100 percent on schedule on time there were no delays
4485386 ive seen the movie it is fabulous we would have been perfectly able to have it out in november
4485387 actor comedian bernie mac passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital
4485388 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth
4485389 he was just so alive i cant believe hes gone
4485390 it was such a popular show because of his bigger than life persona
4485391 race and class while lifting viewers with laughter compassion and cool
4485392 now everyone telling me what i cant do what i can say what i should do and asking are blacks gonna be mad at you
4485393 from very early on i thought he was destined for success
4485394 he never lost track of where he came from and hed often use real life experiences his family his friends in his routine after he made it he stayed a very humble man his family was the most important thing in the world to him
4485395 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
4485396 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
4485397 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
4485398 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
4485399 you learn with more experience that premier players are just like any other players they are all beatable on their day and you can always play well against them
4485400 obviously you are playing against better quality players and most teams have got world class players on hundreds of thousands of pounds a week
4485401 but on the day its 90 minutes 11 versus 11 you have to show your own qualities and how good a player you are personally
4485402 since i have been playing i have always thought as long as you show how good you are everything else takes care of itself
4485403 i will be telling the team on saturday even if there are young boys playing that they should just go out and show what they are good at like we did last year
4485404 we didnt win our league last season by being a bad team and we need to show that
4485405 weve just got to believe work hard and stick together and if things arent going right we have to hold on and hope the game changes around
4485406 we want to show the whole world that we are a decent team and weve got some decent players
4485407 there has never been an archaeological dig of a prehistoric site in minneapolis
4485408 the rapid expansion of the city basically destroyed most of the archaeological sites here
4485409 its a decent start but she left some points on the board
4485410 with the hurdles we just wanted to run it clean and she got a little sloppy at the end but considering it can be over before you start if you catch a hurdle it was a good race
4485411 sogar unser jetziger pr sident kann die wirtschaft nicht so zerst ren wie es die gro e depression damals tat also denke ich nicht dass wir uns um diese theorie sorgen m ssen
4485412 the modestly better tone to the sentiment reading in the preliminary august and revised july reports were in all likelihood due to the steep drop in oil prices that occurred since the early part of july
4485413 nonetheless a very weak trend for consumer spending is the most likely scenario in the near to medium term with debt laden households facing a weakening labor market and consequent diminution of income growth
4485414 i want people to see refugees as individual people not as statistics that can be ignored
4485415 were a great opportunity for basic community health education as well as for gathering data about the political situation

4485419 if i take the star spangled banner and put my own words on it and cuss a few times will it be a hit song
4485420 what if i put some half hearted lyrics over it
4485421 its inexcusable that so many parents fail to appropriately monitor their children problem parents are a big part of why so many teens smoke drink get drunk and abuse illegal and prescription drugs
4485422 maybe there should be a lock on the medicine cabinet now

4485586 agents acts self interestedly therefore principals must structure incentives to make them act in congruence with their aims
4485587 rather than improving the fiscal position and developing the private sector the above analysis shows that privatisation may have less positive outcomes the process is costly may be slow due to limited investor interest may increase prices to generate a commercial return is likely to be a source of corruption will probably be uncompetitive without effective regulation this is not the stuff of poverty eradication or of private sector development privatisation of small competitive enterprises is relatively straightforward however the one size fits all attitude to policy designs is wearing thin and as we have shown is inappropriate in low income countries for years privatisation has been promoted on the basis of over optimistic expectations what is needed is a realistic assessment of what privatisation as opposed to alternative measures for public sector reform can provide

4485597 when our division head told us to think of a tzedaka organization where we can donate the money we thought of zev wolff right away because hes from our community
4485598 im so proud to be part of such a special camp that excels not only in sports programming and all activites but that understands the importance of chesed and giving back to the community at large and how much it can impact on our lives
4485599 if we knew how fast everything would sell we would have had more
4485600 it was great because the girls did the decorating packaging and selling on their own and all for tzedaka
4485601 what i think is so unique about this camp is that we know how to have so much fun but with a purpose
4485602 its an honor to work at a camp that is so focused on infusing fun with meaning
4485603 to a woman who organizes after school projects tiyulim and chugim for children there
4485604 i was very happy because a lot of the kids gave money to the raffle to do the chesed of giving tzedaka not because they wanted to win the prize a nintendo wii
4485605 while everybody is in camp having fun they should think about other people as well and ways of giving

4485634 well im going to do it anyway and its unanimous
4485635 i absolutely recommend the vaccine because kids and adults in close quarters in a lot of situations such as camps and in sports have a chance of contracting meningitis its a small chance but still a chance
4485636 it used to be reserved for kids to leave for college especially in a dormitory situation but was only good for five years
4485637 we didnt recommend shots to kids going to commuter colleges only kids in a dorm or living abroad where they didnt know what the disease situation was like now its recommended by the american academy of pediatrics from age 11 and up and it lasts for ten years weve been giving it to all 11 year olds within the past year there was a case in massapequa of some high school students who contracted meningitis we were getting a lot of calls from parents regarding the vaccine
4485638 the general feeling is that it is less likely to get gb than to actually have a problem getting the infection its worth the risk to get the shot
4485639 theres no question its not risky its wonderful the vaccine is available there is no reason not to take it the disease is very serious its so fast there is no good treatment for the disease people die very quickly its an effective way to prevent meningococcal disease
4485640 the conservatives are now showing clearly what they have in mind for canadas arts and culture
4485641 the lack of explanation for the cuts and the silence of the heritage minister is unacceptable this governments consistent refusal to consider culture as an important part of canadas development is mind boggling
4485642 as if the governments cuts were not bad enough already they also raise questions about which programs will be cancelled next
4485643 the conservatives still have yet to indicate if they intend to continue funding the canadian television fund and the canada new media fund artists in a democracy should not have to live in fear of being the victim of a right wing governments arbitrary decisions
4485644 we are now witnessing the true colour of this conservative government
4485645 they had already started their demolition work just a few months after taking power but they have now decided that they were cancelling cultural programs one by one with the ministers silent consent in fact if we dont act right now there wont be any programs left to cancel
4485646 when i got a lot of wickets in the first two matches i thought i had a chance to have the record
4485647 i learnt from this series that you have to be disciplined bowling at good players
4485648 people got starts if they had converted them into big scores it would have been a different story
4485649 overall we did not play quality cricket to win the series
4485650 i have rarely seen so many injuries on a single day but its part of the game
4485651 the guys showed a lot of character after the second test we fought well and never gave up
4485652 both mendis and murali bowled very well and and kept pressure on a good indian batting lineup
4485653 the jewish community seems to be stuck in a nutritional rut especially when it comes to shabbat meals and holidays
4485654 food for the soul traditional jewish wisdom for healthy eating
4485655 eating habits in the jewish world mimic what is going on in the rest of the world
4485656 but nobody has addressed the jewish community from an insider s perspective
4485657 we have sources like the rambam the shulchan aruch and concepts from the torah that tell us how important it is take care of ourselves
4485658 our physical health is connected to our spiritual health you cant have one without the other
4485659 we need to eat a variety of colorful vegetables and fruits to get the various nutrients they provide
4485660 filling up with vegetables in particular makes us less likely to eat empty calorie foods
4485661 we eat too much processed food and it has come back to haunt us
4485662 you dont have to put on a show and serve so much food on shabbat that the table droops
4485663 shabbat should not be about the quantity of food you make but about the quality serve a few dishes that taste really wonderful
4485664 the sharp drop in short term rates over the past year should eventually end the current slump and spark a powerful market recovery
4485665 an increase in taxes on dividend income would likely hurt shares with high yields it would also encourage investors to move money instead into blue chip growth stocks
4485666 dont expect oil stocks to keep beating the rest of the market as they have done for most of the past five years do expect an eventual rebound in battered financial shares

4485668 still using repossession as the first rather than last resort
4485669 every day shelter is seeing more and more ordinary hardworking people who are terrified of losing their homes
4485670 they are being punished by rising household bills escalating fuel charges and food prices that are going through the roof
4485671 there are a range of options your lender can consider to help reduce or reschedule your payments for a period of time while you get back on your feet
4485672 while we are not seeing repossessions on the same scale as the early 1990s we are making sure the right advice and support is available for the minority of borrowers who may need it at the moment because of global economic pressures
4485673 lenders must now act responsibly even if our prime minister has not done so to minimise the number of people losing their homes
4485674 the level of growth of repossession orders suggests that we are on track for a repossession crisis very similar to the early 1990s
4485675 the content for the emerald and diamond packages is lengthy due to the tremendous amount of keywords but is well worth it when the results come back for the client
4485676 how about just to the pacific ocean with no promises as to the other caveats
4485677 the fact that this was signed in a period of very difficult crisis in the relations between russia and the united states over the situation in georgia shows that of course the missile defense system will be deployed not against iran but against the strategic potential of russia
4485678 there is a presidential decree and it will naturally be implemented
4485679 i guarantee that we will do everything to ensure the presidents decree is carried out
4485680 the icc taskforce needs to report back to the icc they need to take on the advice that theyre picking up not only from feedback theyre getting from australia but also from new zealand and england and south africa and other parts of the world
4485681 were very short of time now if were going to relocate that decision needs to be made in the next few days so time is of the essence

4485684 my main complaint is its inclusion of way too many of kdes rich set of applications such as games tools etc
4485685 not in favour of traditional marriage and i pray that we wont get stuck with him
4485686 if i may be so bold there was another president
4485687 at one time there was a president named ronald reagan who spoke very strongly about americas advocacy for democracy and freedom
4485688 i can tell you from my experience that most of the time media speculation turns out to be wrong
4485689 im staying as governor whether you like it or not
4485690 the lieutenant governor might not like it very much but im staying
4485691 between one candidate john mccain who has always put the country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate who has not
4485692 i dont think the people of the city of detroit should be represented by a person wearing prison clothes or wearing a tether
4485693 the focus of our convention should be on barack obama and how the party intends to get america back on track not on a distraction involving the troubles of one individual
4485694 the nomination of senator obama at the democratic national convention will be a historic event however im focused on running the city and i dont want anything to distract from that extraordinary moment
4485695 the focus should remain on uniting the party and leading our great nation in a different direction
4485696 thats up to him in terms of all the things he has to deal with
4485697 hes a credentialed delegate and hes entitled to be there
4485698 i want to first acknowledge your great mayor kwame kilpatrick
4485699 thats not the kind of change the american people are hoping for
4485700 were just trying to see the situation on the ground
4485701 we need to take some bold transformative steps we need to find some potential areas to invest and see some long term dividends
4485702 we need almost a new deal type investment in alternative resources
4485703 honey ive been here for 85 years i would never leave
4485704 i see where the hope and potential is you have a system in place here
4485705 the problems that used to be associated with places like detroit or toledo are now felt across the board
4485706 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
4485707 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
4485708 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
4485709 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
4485710 we recognize theres a lot of competition for these funds
4485711 thats my biggest concern that well lose the momentum that we have now
4485712 you owe it to yourselves and your neighbors and the world to preserve this
4485713 lake tahoe is one of the most beloved and special places on earth
4485714 but the lake and surrounding basin are natural treasures at risk
4485715 as stewards of this jewel of the sierra it is our responsibility to do everything we can to preserve the lake
4485716 you cant think of the long term without recognizing climate change
4485717 the big buzz we should and need to focus on is preventing these invaders from coming into the lake
4485718 the thoroughbred who leads too early and by too great a margin is more often than not the vulnerable one the one in danger of losing it all to the horse who strategically holds back waits and then thunders in the final furlongs to finish first
4485719 wake up youre liberal how we can take america back from the right
4485720 i want them to know i am sorry it has taken a great toll on them
4485721 somewhere along the way i lost my path i made horrible decisions
4485722 this is a sad case its obvious that you have good skills
4485723 you destroyed the most valuable asset that you possess your good name
4485724 he was not saying oh im sorry i was arrested
4485725 his crime wasnt just ripping people off hes left a trail of devastation in his wake boarded up buildings are going to stay that way for years to come thats what hes done for his community
4485726 bridges to nowhere than the one in alaska and there are more builders of such bridges than those built by alaskas defendant senator
4485727 for us to be anywhere close to double digits represented a huge change from the past
4485728 now in august weve had two new polls one showing about a 6 point lead one a 7 point lead
4485729 but franklin said there has been a shift statewide in party identification
4485730 so the upshot of that is theres been a shift in party balance over the last four years that could be very important to the state and democratic candidates in the state
4485731 i think the polls that come out a week or two after the conventions are going to be critical for telling us whether were going to be again one of these competitive swing states or whether the state has shifted enough that one candidate or the other will maintain a lead
4485732 that weve got to fundamentally change not only our policies but how our politics works how business is done in washington
4485733 garbage collectors would inspect san francisco residents trash to make sure pizza crusts arent mixed in with chip bags or wine bottles under a proposal by mayor gavin newsom
4485734 jimmy i dont want you playing with the williams boys anymore their family doesnt recycle
4485735 we now live in a society where sunday church attendance is down but people wouldnt dream of missing their weekly trek to the altar of the recycling center
4485736 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
4485737 had thought a great deal about the potential of the vice presidency carter talked at length about how he saw the office as a wasted national asset he was determined to use his vice presidency in a way no president had done previously
4485738 made it clear to carter that he did not want to be considered if it was to be a strictly ceremonial office he was only interested in a truly substantive role
4485739 while i question the value of some of the hd hqv tests when evaluating blu ray a topic for another time they are in fact valid tests
4485740 my sources i do have some really tell me that intels less than stellar scores are due to a player software issue properly configured advanced de interlacing will result in scores 20 points higher still not perfect scores but coming within the realm of workable and my hope is that subsequent driver tweaks will improve this even further
4485741 more and more tvs are supporting this refresh rate and even using it as advertising copy in their features list
4485742 theyre the ones who are consulted when their friends want to buy a tv a stereo or a home theater pc
4485743 but right now their recommendation is suffering from those two issues the second of which is going to bite us in the ass if it isnt fixed soon because av receivers are not exactly uncommon and unless i miss my mark anyone buying one of those sexy new 500 dell hybrids with the g965 in them are going to have this same problem if they get the
4485744 symantec already faces a formidable foe in microsoft corp but now the security and storage company must also defend itself from red hat inc and the open source market in fact red hat has launched an aggressive attack against symantecs veritas business
4485745 sled runs a linux kernel an open source software stack and is marketed and commercially supported as a linux distribution by novell
4485746 dieses urteil ist f r mich in keinster weise nachvollziehbar aber wir werden es akzeptieren und uns dadurch nicht aus der fassung bringen lassen
4485747 es liegt mir fern schiedsrichterleistungen zu kommentieren aber was herr gagelmann an den dfb gemeldet hat entspricht absolut nicht den tatsachen das ist auch durch die betrachtung der fernsehbilder nochmals deutlich geworden
4485748 mit hohem tempo in die spielergruppe gerannt war einen italienischen spieler weggesto en hat
4485749 i sort of remember looking at it and thinking someones got to do something about this
4485750 to my complete surprise and shock people were obeying my traffic signals
4485751 there were all kinds of impromptu block parties that happened all over the city restaurants did their best to accommodate their customers when something like a blackout occurs people generally are going to pitch together and help out everyone else it sounds kinda hokey but its the truth
4485752 the price of gasoline in the last year has had a bigger impact on peoples thoughts about conservation than the blackout
4485753 we never found in much of the research we had done that there was a direct connection between the big blackout and issues around using too much or too little energy
4485754 i think people are creatures of habit to some degree and i dont think theres any lingering effects in reduced consumption from the blackout
4485755 the individual customers out there i believe want to help
4485756 to me it was the blackout day that got me thinking more and more about the environment and everything ive been doing it was just amazing how much we could get done without electricity and we actually enjoyed having no power
4485757 there were a few things that wouldve been nice like having the hot water tank working but for everything else we became creative we started having fondue
4485758 it can be contagious if you know one person doing something then another is more likely to start doing it as well and so it creates a chain reaction
4485759 environmental problems have been ongoing for a very long time but now im seeing that people are taking it seriously and i think its only going to increase probably exponentially over the next little while
4485760 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4485761 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4485762 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4485763 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4485764 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4485765 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4485766 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4485767 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4485768 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4485769 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4485770 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4485771 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4485772 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4485773 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4485774 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4485775 republican presidential candidate john mccain now enjoys a healthy 88 7 percent lead over barack obama among republicans
4485776 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4485777 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4485778 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4485779 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4485780 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4485781 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4485782 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
4485783 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
4485784 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
4485785 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
4485786 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
4485787 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
4485788 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
4485789 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
4485790 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
4485791 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
4485792 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
4485793 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
4485794 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
4485795 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
4485796 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
4485797 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
4485798 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie
4485799 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
4485800 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
4485801 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4485802 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4485803 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4485804 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
4485805 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
4485806 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how
4485807 remember that it was the democrats who created the kkk as their political action wing they were the same ones who kept segregation going with george wallace leading the fight democrats fought against the emancipation proclamation womens right to vote civil rights and the list goes on martin luther king was a registered republican they use the same plays that they did against lincoln same rhetoric it is amazing these are all facts that the dems dont want you to know they are purpetually reworking history it is proven that most of what they blame on republicans is actually what they are doing or have done
4485808 a source close to kaine said tuesday night before this mornings announcement about warner that the governor had seemed glum and believed that he would
4485809 the love of my life has passed me by my life is over
4485810 was consistently within the top 5 of his class as a whole
4485811 a source close to kaine said tuesday night before this mornings announcement about warner that the governor had seemed glum and believed that he would
4485812 the love of my life has passed me by my life is over
4485813 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4485814 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4485815 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4485816 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4485817 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4485818 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4485819 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4485820 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4485821 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4485822 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4485823 the last eight years have been nothing short of a disaster
4485824 we need a new start not only domestically but internationally
4485825 i am very delighted to see that the obamas campaign has reached out to many community activists from all asian american and pacific islander communities including those who erstwhile were ardent supporters of hillary clinton and john edwards
4485826 is from a new generation of leaders as immigrants to this country we can easily identify ourselves with his life story he is an inspiration for our children born here that is perhaps the reason why so many of young generation indian americans have flocked to his campaign obama has also surrounded himself with many political veterans of indian origin
4485827 each of these individuals are deeply committed to ensuring that the rapidly growing south asian american communities are engaged and participating in this years historic elections
4485828 there was a sense that we have got to do something the conservatives in the state had gone so far to the right that it was just out of control they believed the number one threat to colorado was gay marriage and whether they posted the ten commandments in the public schools just absurd considering even at that time the huge number of foreclosures not to mention health care
4485829 mccains going to prevail the more people see of obama in the general race they start to see him as very left wing
4485830 even with a strong progressive infrastructure when it comes to presidential politics there are so many other things that decide it
4485831 delegates will be compelled to sleep five and six and perhaps more in a room
4485832 and in a good many instances two delegates will have to occupy the same bed
4485833 the men here are less prosperous looking than those who gathered for the republican convention in chicago they more obviously represent the masses the farmer element is everywhere distinguishable the majority of the delegates come from the soil and they look it
4485834 the mccain campaign relies on big money lobbyists and theyll rely on him
4485835 in the you scratch my back world of washington 931 million gets the special interests the best government money can buy but just think of the payday these lobbyists might expect in a mccain administration
4485836 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4485837 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4485838 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4485839 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4485840 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on iser claims the mccain campaign has a track record of using music without permission made them stop and he used an abba song and a frankie valli song its ridiculous and its setting a terrible example
4485841 its shocking that they dont even attempt to get permission theres no copyright difference between using a song to sell cars or by people running for president the music industry continues to suffer due to lack of respect for intellectual property rights and a candidate for president has a duty to lead by example and ensuring their campaign does as well the copyright protections are derived from the constitution itself
4485842 i think these ballots need to be up in tallahassee now so whatever needs to be done can be done quickly
4485843 kerry himself is already implementing the lessons of 2004 the massachusetts senator launched a website wednesday truth fights back challenging the assertions in corsis book
4485844 believe obamas senior aides must figure out how to effectively and directly respond to the book
4485845 initially wanted to respond directly to the charges but his top circle of advisers after heated debate counseled against it former senior advisers have said in the subsequent weeks that august as the national media picked up the story and began constantly looping the ads kerrys campaign reversed itself and went on the offensive today within kerrys circle and outside it the view is that the response was too late
4485846 recent reports on obamas florida spending which easily overwhelms john mccains suggest that the sunshine state remains at least at this point the democratic nominees top pickoff target for 2008 much as it was for john kerry in 2004 and al gore in 2000
4485847 heres the math since the start of the general election season obama has dropped 6 51 million a full 18 percent of his overall ad spending and by the largest chunk of change allotted to any one state to broadcast 10 000 commercials on florida television mccains total disbursement 0 zero ads meanwhile chicago has sent more than 200 full time staffers and signed up at least 150 000 online volunteers to man the states 35 field offices the most of any battleground mccains local staff is a quarter of the size and much of it is shared with the state party
4485848 if obama can win florida on nov 4 which george w bush carried by five points in almost guaranteed to win the white house
4485849 the simple fact is that at least two of the candidates mccain is thinking very seriously about picking as his second in command tom ridge and sen joe lieberman i conn who are publicly in favor of abortion rights a third potential candidate former massachusetts gov mitt romney was supportive of abortion rights until a few years ago although he has now adopted a solidly pro life position
4485850 but there isnt a whole lot of love lost between the two groups would mccain picking a pro choice vice president inflame these critical voters who have largely held their collective tongues to this point or will ardently pro life voters make a pragmatic decision and stay behind mccain under the belief that the arizona senator would be a far better president for the issues important to them than would obama
4485851 i can remember being one of a small group of people who came to bill ayers house to learn that alice palmer was stepping down from the senate and running for congress
4485852 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4485853 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4485854 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4485855 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
4485856 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
4485857 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
4485858 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
4485859 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
4485860 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country

4485866 it would be impossible to solely credit the surge for the turn around
4485867 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4485868 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4485869 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4485870 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore

4485873 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4485874 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4485875 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4485876 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect

4485879 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
4485880 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4485881 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4485882 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4485883 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4485884 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4485885 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4485886 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4485887 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4485888 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4485889 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4485890 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4485891 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4485892 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4485893 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4485894 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4485895 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4485896 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4485897 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4485898 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4485899 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4485900 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4485901 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4485902 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4485903 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4485904 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4485905 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4485906 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4485907 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4485908 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4485909 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4485910 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4485911 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4485912 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4485913 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4485914 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4485915 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
4485916 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
4485917 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
4485918 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
4485919 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
4485920 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
4485921 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
4485922 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4485923 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
4485924 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
4485925 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
4485926 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
4485927 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
4485928 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
4485929 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4485930 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4485931 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4485932 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
4485933 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4485934 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4485935 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4485936 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4485937 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
4485938 the un secretary general had not uttered a word meaning that he respects our law and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us air it out in clarion call to say that malaysia is not up to their standards
4485939 why should gore and the former us vice president give judgment of evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning for the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
4485940 but if they had any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
4485941 he is one of the great american leaders whose support of the jewish state is inviolable
4485942 it would be very problematic for israel to give up the west bank from their own standpoint of security the same thing with the golan heights giving up the golan heights makes most of the galilee a sitting target
4485943 there is an enormous amount of land in arab control all over the middle east and to say that it a palestinian state has to be on the west bank limits the capacity to bring some type of resolution but lets be honest there is not going to be some instant kumbaya moment where everybody builds the campfire toasts marshmallows and sings holding hands this conflict is not new it has been going on since all the way to the time of abraham and its not going to be resolved any time in the immediate future
4485944 i think hes a great man and if john mccain as president picked him to be secretary of state or some other cabinet position i dont think anyone has a problem with that but i dont know that he would be a good fit to be vice president
4485945 je suis tellement effondr e pour cette famille en tant que maman cest tr s difficile dimaginer que mon enfant est responsable dun accident qui a caus la mort dun b b
4485946 jesp re quils vont vite sortir il faut pas leur donner uniquement une petite tape sur les mains jen suis consciente mais je suis s re que la justice fran aise a plein dautres alternatives que la prison pour des enfants de 13 ans
4485947 culpabilisent norm ment de ce quils ont fait des cons quences de cet accident
4485948 une demande de remise en libert a t d pos e par leur avocate et sera examin e lundi par le tribunal de bastia
4485949 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
4485950 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4485951 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4485952 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4485953 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4485954 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
4485955 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
4485956 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
4485957 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
4485958 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4485959 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
4485960 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
4485961 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
4485962 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
4485963 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
4485964 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
4485965 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
4485966 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
4485967 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
4485968 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
4485969 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
4485970 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
4485971 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
4485972 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
4485973 they can hang the panels over the screen its all about personalization
4485974 these products are great quality so something can last four years and beyond to the first apartment
4485975 someone driving to work goes past a petrol station and sees petrol at a bargain price and thinks you beauty but when they drive home its gone up 10c a litre it makes people very angry
4485976 australians dont want that great volatility in prices but nor do they want to pay more for their petrol to do away with it
4485977 the government wants to see an end to the days when you drive past a petrol station in the morning and see a certain price and drive past in the afternoon and see a price 10c or 15c a litre higher
4485978 i just dont think its going to do what its meant to do
4485979 we have seen first hand how asbestos has wreaked havoc on americans working in naval shipyards automobile plants and the construction industry most often this is through their employers conscious choice for profits over a workers health
4485980 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4485981 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile but is morally treasonable to the american people
4485982 government has a final responsibility for the well being of its citizenship if private cooperative endeavor fails to provide work for willing hands and relief for the unfortunate those suffering hardship from no fault of their own have a right to call upon the government for aid and a government worthy of its name must make fitting response
4485983 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors
4485984 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
4485985 all men having power ought to be distrusted to a certain degree
4485986 i believe in human dignity as the source of national purpose in human liberty as the source of national action in the human heart as the source of national compassion and in the human mind as the source of our invention and our ideas it is i believe the faith in our fellow citizens as individuals and as people that lies at the heart of the liberal faith for liberalism is not so much a party creed or set of fixed platform promises as it is an attitude of mind and heart a faith in mans ability through the experiences of his reason and judgment to increase for himself and his fellow men the amount of justice and freedom and brotherhood which all human life deserves
4485987 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid
4485988 whats happened in the last 40 50 years is that human activity has made the water quality conditions worse
4485989 tend to occur in areas that are historically prime fishing grounds
4485990 muvva erf will heal hersef now put some money in my plate
4485991 so what if librul tree huggers dont like it well be dead let somebody else clean up the mess
4485992 we do not inherit this land from our ancestors we borrow it from our children
4485993 we borrow from our children the opportunity for a better life for us and leave them even less american saying zagnut says
4485994 green light to sue her former employer for pregnancy related bias
4485995 the erratic nature of infertility treatment can be frustrating for some employers interfering with planning meetings and business travel
4485996 keep it secret for personal reasons assuming they have enough job flexibility to do so
4485997 our prevention measures have yet to reach optimum success because many high risk people here still refuse to use condoms even though we have actually managed to reach them
4485998 this is different from cambodia for example where people are willing to comply with the government campaigns for use of condoms
4485999 this study should be enlightening and practice changing for doctors and patients alike
4486000 i would like to congratulate usaid and star alliance for bringing out this product addressing an important need of plhiv this will help them access timely care and live better lives this is a first step to breaking down financial barriers of plhivs in accessing treatment
4486001 our support to project connect has spurred the private sector to address the critical insurance needs of people living with hiv this aligns well with the government of india led national aids control plan 3 to increase private sector engagement in hiv aids services we also hope that this effort will send a positive signal to the private sector in india to join hands with naco to strengthen the national response under the strong leadership of dg naco ms k sujatha rao
4486002 with the objective of engaging the insurance sector in india in the fight against hiv we assisted star health to fine tune the product to suit the specific needs of plhiv further working in close partnership with the knp plhiv across the state were educated and mobilized to enroll in this insurance scheme
4486003 we expect this initiative will not just pilot what kind of insurance schemes fit the needs of hiv patients but also enable the private insurance sector to offer need based community led health insurance schemes for example to serve lower income plhiv we reduced the premium by 40 and have included coverage of hospitalization expenses excluding tuberculosis and gastroenteritis before the aids stage
4486004 i am glad that finally an insurance company has come out with a policy for us its a milestone in the fight against the discrimination of people living with hiv plhiv and their family members will gain hope and confidence and change the perception that we are a burden to our families
4486005 i know that the one thing that is certain about the process is that it is unpredictable i entered into it as a person who was cautiously optimistic but not presumptuous
4486006 it may well be that politics being like it is may have some influence
4486007 but ive always taken the position that those judicial nominating commissions also look objectively and not with political views
4486008 i think he would be well qualified i think the experience he had on the 2nd district court of appeal will be useful to him as well as his legislative experience
4486009 he has a great demeanor and is very knowledgeable about the law when ive appeared before him i thought he asked the right questions and knew the issues and was well prepared
4486010 this is kind of a no lose proposition for me
4486011 if i go to the supreme court ill be grateful for that if that doesnt work out ill be grateful for the continued opportunity to serve on the 2nd district court of appeal
4486012 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
4486013 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
4486014 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
4486015 we are actually reviewing iphones from a hsbc group perspective and when i say that i mean globally
4486016 a decision on a piece of hardware like that would potentially be deployed conservatively to 200 000 people
4486017 you know its a big decision especially when you have an existing fleet out there
4486018 we have limited pitch authority at flight levels were descending to see if we can regain pitch authority
4486019 at this time we would like to declare this an emergency and also have cfr fire and rescue equipment standing by in st louis
4486020 we had a pitch authority problem now that we have come down to a lower altitude it seems to have rectified itself we do have pitch control of the aircraft at this time
4486021 just thought wed spice things up a little bit today
4486022 anytime a pilot says that somethings not working the way its supposed to then you know you make sure you tighten your seat belt everything seemed under control the pilots knew what they were doing
4486023 examination of the hardware did not reveal any evidence of missing components nor any evidence of tampering

4486028 his coach and everybody in flint mich during high school called him special k he was an outstanding athlete
4486029 and for his bar mitzvah i took him to the montreal olympics
4486030 i always had olympic dreams but was never a good enough athlete
4486031 but my dream is coming true and i am participating in a different way
4486032 lenovo team the tech company that bought imbs pc personal computer unit a partner of this years olympic games
4486033 after a couple of years he told them he would like to have an overseas experience
4486034 brought in for senior conversations with some of the leadership for insight and to do training programs getting the government to be more communicative and transparent when communicating about issues
4486035 because of that and because i am in the public relations business when people want to do a story about what are the ramifications say if spielberg isnt in the opening ceremonies they ask me what does this mean for china and the games
4486036 its pure commotion in his house right now so i dont want to go during the olympics
4486037 i served as a crewman aboard another boat a 30 foot sloop then the owners took off for home leaving the boat with harrison and me with the agreement that we could take three months to bring it home providing we got it there intact
4486038 naturally we surfed our way back stopping and anchoring wherever the surf looked good taking our time in the lazy hot waters off mexico
4486039 it lay uninhabited a humpback of pure desert 150 miles off the mexican coast three degrees north of our charted course somewhere off mazatlan
4486040 we dropped the anchor got our boards got out of our clothes and over the side in one
4486041 then jazzed we fell on the beach to rest and we found the sign it was a crude thing hand lettered on an old board and jammed into the sand

4486047 readers in boulder colorado springs greeley and fort collins might reasonably think that nothing gets done at the legislature and that whatever does get accomplished has little impact on their lives
4486048 yet they wont realize that they only hear about their local lawmakers when they are embroiled in scandal or controversy
4486049 the rocky post and ap are not going to write stories on the solar panel rebates bill that the boulder legislator promised to fight for or the uranium mining bill that affects only northern colorado or the education changes that el paso countys only house democrat is pushing for but they will write about it when el paso countys rep
4486050 it boiled down to making the best use of our resources to minimizing the duplication of coverage that the ap provided and to focusing more on our local markets
4486051 since our decision we have published fewer stories and shorter stories about what goes on in the legislature
4486052 this doesnt mean we have dropped local legislative coverage altogether at first these duties shifted onto beat reporters who would keep an eye on statehouse action that intersected their beats recently we added a twist to this coverage plan assigning one reporter to keeping an eye on multiple levels of regional government including the legislature still we expect other reporters to fold a bit of legislative coverage into their beats as it affects them

4486056 washington defense secretary robert m gates will endorse a 20 billion plan to substantially increase the size of afghanistan s army and will also restructure the military command of american and nato forces in response to the growing taliban threat senior pentagon and military officials said thursday
4486057 taken together the two decisions are an acknowledgment of shortcomings that continue to hinder nato and american led operations in afghanistan with the war in iraq still an obstacle to any immediate american troop increase in afghanistan the plan was described by officials as an attempt to increase allied and afghan capabilities in advance of deploying the additional american brigades that mr gates and his commanders agree are necessary

4486060 nato took command of the nationwide mission to stabilize afghanistan in 2006 the allies expected to face little direct combat and to focus on reconstruction and on maintaining security in areas that were relatively calm in contrast the american led mission in afghanistan has focused from the start of the war on combat operations to capture or kill insurgents and terrorists as well as on training afghan security forces counter insurgency and reconstruction
4486061 yup but it would be much cheaper to just buy the opium crop
4486062 meanwhile the taliban managed to nearly eradicate the majority of the opium production by 2001
4486063 as much as one third of afghanistans gdp comes from growing poppy and illicit drugs including opium and its two derivatives morphine and heroin as well as hashish production opium production in afghanistan has soared to a new record in 2007

4486066 obamas popularity is not because of his race but in spite of it he is popular because of his charisma enthusiasm vision energy convictions and because of the confidence and hope that emanate from his persona
4486067 his stated policies are potentially extremely destructive and foolish such as massive tax increases and protectionism
4486068 it is our business however to go after terrorist enemies of the united states and our nato allies wherever we find them
4486069 it is this intensely emotional response to obama that is such a concern his followers love him with the zeal of cult members without bothering to discuss policy
4486070 what i am now is a citizen of a country that was attacked by people who flew commercial airplanes into buildings and i think we need to keep that in mind
4486071 but none of obamas supporters bothered to discover the facts which are readily available
4486072 is this e mail real it says no it is a bogus bunch of bird droppings

4486074 youre using the obama campaign site as a reference for his tax policies
4486075 q would obama tax my profits if i sell my home would he tax my ira would he tax my water
4486076 i think the most reasonable take is that obama is probably doing just fine
4486077 like you said that left us no choice but to intervene destroy the training camps and remove the taleban from power since it was fairly clearly that they were in cahoots with al qaeda

4486085 the mere presence of an iraq run by friendly to the us and containing us troops is anathema to iranian fundamentalism and its desires for the iraqi south and the holiest shrines of the shia imagine how intolerable it is for iran to have the us in the nations all around it turkey afghanistan saudi arabia iraq pakistan etc
4486086 it may be ifficult for you to understand iran and islamic facism is the nazi threat of this century

4486088 hitlers legal power was based upon the enabling act which was passed quite legally by the reichstag and which allowed the fuehrer and his representatives in plain language to be what they wanted or in legal language to issue regulations having the force of law exactly the same type of act was passed by the knesset israelis parliament immediately after the 1967 conquest granting the israeli governor and his representatives the power of hitler which they use in hitlerian manner

4486091 we will have to face the reality that israel is neither innocent nor redemptive and that in its creation and expansion we as jews have caused what we historically have suffered a refugee population in diaspora
4486092 when we followers of the prophetic judaism returned to palestine the majority of jewish people preferred to learn from hitler rather than from us

4486100 the zionist movement arose in late nineteenth century europe influenced by the nationalist ferment sweeping that continent zionism acquired its particular focus from the ancient jewish longing for the return to zion and received a strong impetus from the increasingly intolerable conditions facing the large jewish community in tsarist russia the movement also developed at the time of major european territorial acquisitions in asia and africa and benefited from the european powers competition for influence in the shrinking ottoman empire one result of this involvement with european expansionism however was that the leaders of the nascent nationalist movements in the middle east viewed zionism as an adjunct of european colonialism moreover zionist assertions of the contemporary relevance of the jews historical ties to palestine coupled with their land purchases and immigration alarmed the indigenous population of the ottoman districts that comprised palestine the jewish community yishuv rose from 6 percent of palestines population in 1880 to 10 percent by 1914 although the numbers were insignificant the settlers were outspoken enough to arouse the opposition of arab leaders and induce them to exert counter pressure on the ottoman regime to prohibit jewish immigration and land buying

4486106 the majority of black americans are unaware of the complexity of the meaning of israel to american jews but ironically afro zionists have as an intense an emotional identification with africa and with the third world as american jews have with israel doubly ironic this same intensity of identification with a motherland seems rooted in the mythologies common to both groups in this special sense in the spiritual sense implied by zion and diaspora and promised land maybe black americans are americas jews but given the isolation of black americans from any meaningful association with africa extensions of the mythology would be futile we have no distant homeland preparing an ingathering
4486107 israel has the most powerful military in the region including nuclear weapons and has the unconditional support of the most powerful nation in the world the usa
4486108 considering the circumstances the best thing the palestinians could do is accept their fate and negotiate an agreement leading to the creation of a sovereign nation encompassing th gaza strip and west bank
4486109 why should any citizens be carrying guns and why one group but not the other are the arabs more of a threat to the jews than the jews are to the arabs
4486110 the real point as noticed here by one of americas most prominent one man bloggers is that the brits are actually leading the way in pointing out to the world that american faults are generally over reported and american strengths under reported

4486112 even if evidence does not link iraq directly to the attack any strategy aiming at the eradication of terrorism and its sponsors must include a determined effort to remove saddam hussein from power in iraq failure to undertake such an effort will constitute an early and perhaps decisive surrender in the war on international terrorism

4486150 what have the palestinians or the gulf states given in reperations
4486151 by way of introduction the obvious cannot be overstressed here namely that israel is the occupier and therefore the aggressor while the palestinians are the occupied and therefore the victims paradoxically this fact is hardly ever even taken into consideration by western politicians thus ignoring the fundamental element of the conflict needless to say attempting to solve this conflict without differentiating between the aggressor israel and the victimized the palestinians will never lead to permanent peace

4486157 if i were an arab leader i would never sign an agreement with israel it is normal we have taken their country it is true god promised it to us but how could that interest them our god is not theirs there has been anti semitism the nazis hitler auschwitz but was that their fault they see but one thing we have come and we have stolen their country why would they accept that

4486161 meanwhile more folk die while desperately trying to break the fairs fair
4486162 the character of the provisional palestinian state will be determined through negotiations between the palestinian authority and israel the provisional state will have provisional borders and certain aspects of sovereignty be fully demilitarized with no military forces but only with police and internal security forces of limited scope and armaments be without the authority to undertake defense alliances or military cooperation and israeli control over the entry and exit of all persons and cargo as well as of its air space and electromagnetic spectrum

4486164 the brits you spoke to are mistaken the problems in the middle east were started by the british and the french after world war one
4486165 as to where this policy of the british and later the americans originated we neednt look further than a series of meetings held in britain starting in 1905 headed by prime minister sir henry campbell bannerman from this a high committee was formed it specialized in matters of colonialism consisting of members from the participating states of leading historians social economic and agricultural analysts scholars geologists and experts in oil and gas the members of this committee met in london in 1907 the final decisions made by the conference were threefold 1 separating the muslim lands in the east from those in the west making their unity more difficult 2 planting a new enemy for the muslims on their lands in the first qiblah and the third of the holiest mosques this would draw their attention to a new enemy focusing all their energies on defeating him and in turn weakening their capability of resisting western aggression causing them to forget what occurred during the days of the crusades 3 establishing an advanced base for the disbelieving colonialists at the head of them britain to protect their interests implement their plans and schemes and ensuring the outflow of natural resources from the region as well as the import of their goods and products into the markets of the region the goal of the colonialist powers then and now is to keep arab peoples backwards by not enabling them to elect popular leaders and to control the vast mineral wealth that the arabs were fortune enough to possess

4486172 these are situations that are faced internationally and we have got to find a better way to try to make sure journalists are not caught up in crossfire

4486178 the harm done by dumping down an alien population upon an arab country arab all around in the hinterland may never be remedied what we have done is by concessions not to the jewish people but to a zionist extreme section to start a running sore in the east and no one can tell how far that sore will extend

4486277 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold
4486278 we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film released july 11 2007 which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment
4486279 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films
4486280 post production on half blood prince was completed on time and the studios release plans for the will not be affected by this change
4486281 i am extremely proud of this latest film and of the work of director david yates and our incomparable cast
4486282 i believe we have developed and pushed the series further still we are all looking forward to sharing it with harry potter fans around the world even if we have to wait just a bit longer
4486283 even as we put finishing touches on this latest film
4486284 we are already beginning preparations on the final two films and i am excited to bring this remarkable series to the exciting and moving conclusion its loyal fans deserve

4486300 we thought we were paying for the best of care

4486303 often as the problems unfold i find myself saying why on earth did i have kids but the reality is life would be empty without them just dont tell them that
4486304 my advice to dads is not startling it was exactly what i was advised and ignored to my regret enjoy the moment
4486305 enjoy the bad school plays and the appalling food enjoy watching the sport and collecting them from parties enjoy their growth and their rebellion and their innocence and the rate at which they absorb life
4486306 but most of all remember it is all too brief and that youll be looking back with them one day finally understanding what you are missing
4486307 it is something different and complementary from what mums provide
4486308 fathers are fathers for life and being a good bad or absent father will affect your childs future

4486312 let me get this straight countrywide is too cash strapped to prevent layoffs refinance borrowers or ward off bankruptcy without help from bank of america but it can afford a posh junket for its co conspirators in the sub prime mess
4486313 if we dont do this now carcass will be erased from the history of rock to a certain extent
4486314 theres so much access to information out there but it seems to me that the new generation of kids just really dont know sh they dont really know who black sabbath is never mind carcass theres definitely a generation of kids out there who are not aware of carcass because we havent been around for 15 years a year is a long time in metal these days
4486315 i guess over the last few years weve kind of drifted into each others circles again myself guitarist bill steer and mike and mikes kind of i dont want to over exaggerate this but hes always been the keenest to do this because since he formed arch enemy and has been out on the road again hes kind of realized what kind of phenomenon carcass is
4486316 mikes always been kind of hassling me and bill on the side about doing something and so i guess the stars aligned at some point because for years i said id never do it if drummer ken owen who suffered a brain hemorrhage in 1999 couldnt play i thought it would be a bit like led zeppelin playing without john bonham how can you kind of find a way around that
4486317 it seems to me nostalgia is the new rock and roll not to sound arrogant but im well aware of the importance of this band even if no one else is theres a generation of people who were into carcass whove grown up now that never saw the band and now they have some disposable income theyve created the demand for this reunion
4486318 never say never but i cant see it happening i cant see it working
4486319 for something like that to happen everybodys head has to be on the same continent
4486320 these bands that start playing again some of them get carried away and they write an album and they start saying its the best thing we ever done and then it just isnt we dont want to be one of those bands we dont want to be doing this next year i could maybe see us playing again in some of the countries that were not touching this year but lets see if we kill each other when were in north america on a tour bus were getting on great but we want to keep that chemistry and not get burned out we dont want to be doing it just for the money because it can turn into a chore thats what happened the first time it seemed like work and it wasnt fun anymore so i figured f this ill go get a job if youre doing something just for the money i think having a job is a bit more honest than playing in a band just for the money
4486321 its like everything just merges into one nowadays everythings sounding the same the problem with the modern metal scene is people are too busy copying bands wholesale and not actually taking an influence and doing something new with it i dont think its laziness i think it just comes down to imagination and intelligence
4486322 ozzy did it and even zakk wyldes done it playing with black label and ozzy
4486323 other people have done it but as far as vocally its just me and ozzy its good company to be in hes the dude that basically created this niche i think it would be pretty grueling to do it for a full tour
4486324 weve heard what they had to say were a lot more informed now than we were before the day started and theres obviously some decisions to be made in the next few days
4486325 the concerns are still there of course there have been lots of things said that are going to be put into place and lets hope those things are put in place to an appropriate level
4486326 were only three weeks away from one of the biggest one day tournaments that we play and we still dont know if were going
4486327 in all honesty nothing i heard yesterday has allayed our concerns
4486328 it was an interesting meeting an active meeting it went for a while
4486329 there is no question about the effort put in by the pakistan cricket board and the pakistan government the security plans are outstanding theyre the best weve ever seen for cricket
4486330 but the fact is they are unproven and we dont know if the plans can be delivered we need to see them demonstrated the threat in pakistan is real theres a lot of political instability and weve seen more reports of activity by the taliban
4486331 if were going to relocate now it needs to be made within the next few days
4486332 operationally it would be difficult but its certainly not an option that would be discarded at this point and it could be relocated
4486333 i havent got a decision to make until cricket australia make a decision
4486334 its a hypothetical question i think the players that youve probably heard from before might not go but well wait and see what happens in the next few days
4486335 many of us are concerned about the quality of care extended to those who receive elective surgery
4486336 i am really starting to wonder more and more where he is now the nights are colder and colder his family must be aching in their hearts i do not know how i would be if i lost my child i cannot imagine it please come home little yadav
4486337 my heart goes out to his parents and i pray for his safe return
4486338 ive always had a problem with people telling me oh you
4486339 so when everyone was telling me that i had to release my single on itunes because they own the market and thats just what youve gotta do these days i decided that i wasnt going to do it my whole career ive done that whenever everyones headed in the same direction i turn around and run the other way
4486340 this whole thing wasnt some attempt to change the way the industry works or some sh like that it was basically me knowing i had a good song one that people would love when they heard it
4486341 i mean people say itunes is popular because its convenient but so is mcdonalds that dont mean people arent still making reservations to go eat at fancy restaurants too
4486342 i knew the track was solid its got two of the best songs of all time mashed up together lynyrd skynyrds sweet home alabama and warren zevons werewolves of london its got great melodies so really my work was done
4486343 i knew people would hear it and know i wrote it theyd know it was real and thered be that connection and thats whats missing in music today i think people dont believe half the sh they hear some rapper or some pop girl singing about but with me they do and thats why people have reacted the way they have to the song
4486344 i think today everyones worried about looking cool about over thinking everything about all this bullsh
4486345 i just think thats a waste of time and i think a lot of other people do too i just want to have fun enjoy life and have a good time and i think theres a lot of people out there who are just like me
4486346 there is a beautiful irony that the nostalgic cabaret that is are throwing at people in 2008 gets critical acclaim in the easily pleased uk press with mbv still playing the exact same set they did 20 years ago
4486347 actually i dont really know how i got the nickname
4486348 it just came up and people started talking to me and going hey bonus jonas and i was like hey whatever
4486349 hell tell it straight up and hell be mean if he needs to
4486350 once i got comfortable with having diabetes frankie used to call me pancreas boy but hes the cutest kid alive so he can get away with it
4486351 i remember sitting down with frankie and said nick is in the hospital and hell be home in a couple of days
4486352 i feel very strongly that this is just another attempt to delay the inevitable

4486363 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that senator mccain has used this song in a hit piece on barack obama is anathema to jackson

4486370 tom horton amrs executive vice president of finance and planning and chief financial officer said american airlines continues to execute its fleet renewal plan to control costs while prudently reinvesting in the travel experience for customers
4486371 enable the airlines to reduce costs and attract new customers helping to mitigate pressure on airfares from record fuel costs
4486372 we do not agree with the faas findings and characterizations of americans action in these cases we believe the proposed penalties are excessive
4486373 waiving the fee for a 3rd checked bag for military personnel traveling on northwest airlines is under consideration
4486374 customers and communities will gain improved access to 207 new international destinations just by our ability to link our networks
4486375 greater opportunities to earn and redeem your aadvantage miles on each airlines transatlantic flights
4486376 this is a pricing matter we cant discuss future plans
4486377 many military have government travel cards that can be used for fees
4486378 average roundtrip cost of jet fuel todays prices is about 300 per passenger we would have to charge about 650 700 a passenger to break even
4486379 fares probably need to increase at this point another 15 20 percent before airlines cover their costs
4486380 at some point it becomes like a saturday night live skit where youre paying for a seat belt and to use the bathroom theyre running out of things to charge us for
4486381 i used to go over to have lunch with doris and jim and i would sit across from jim at the kitchen table and think before me is a true american hero
4486382 there were thousands of bodies piled high i saw hearts that had been taken from live people in medical experiments
4486383 its important that we dont allow ourselves to lose him
4486384 its the memory of heroes like james hoyt and the memories of what theyve done that we must ensure that we keep alive and share with the current generation and future generations
4486385 mr hoyt as a young man saw unspeakable horrors when he was one of the soldiers to discover the buchenwald concentration camp and those are experiences as a country and a world we can never forget
4486386 you think back on a young man 19 years old and to have the experience that he had
4486387 a symbol of the chill blooded cruelty of the german nazi state
4486388 there is reason to believe that the prompt arrival of the 6th armored division on the scene saved many hundreds and perhaps thousands of lives
4486389 at the same time a group of russians just escaped from the concentration camp burst out of the woods attempting to attack the ss men the russians were restrained and interrogated
4486390 as guides to investigate report and rejoin as rapidly as possible
4486391 i took this side journey of about 3 km away from our main force because we kept encountering ss guards and prison inmates and the latter told us of the large camp to the south
4486392 we had been told by our intelligence that we might overrun a large prison camp but we or at least i had no idea of either the gigantic size of the camp or of the full extent of the incredible brutality
4486393 we were tumultuously greeted by what i was told were 21 000 men and what an incredible greeting that was
4486394 i was picked up by arms and legs thrown into the air caught thrown again caught thrown etc until i had to stop it i was getting dizzy
4486395 how the men found such a surge of strength in their emaciated condition was one of those bodily wonders in which the spirit sometimes overcomes all weaknesses of the flesh my but it was a great day
4486396 the worst concentration camp yet to be uncovered by west wall troops
4486397 seeing these things it changes you i was a kid
4486398 des moines had been the furthest id ever been from home i still have horrific dreams usually someone needs help and i cant help them im in a situation where im trapped and i cant get out
4486399 thinking back i would have pushed to be a psychologist if for no other reason than to understand myself better
4486400 memories of evil get erased for life must go on and new generations cannot be locked in the past but they would do well to remember the past
4486401 when the prisoners saw jim they picked him up and threw him in the air thats how happy they were after seeing such horrors prisoners had been hung from hooks to die he saw a lampshade made from a prisoners tattoo jim carried those horrors with him forever he never got what he had seen out of his mind if you ever wondered about jim think about what he saw

4486405 a huge number of people suffer from allergies and while hay fever for example is generally not life threatening allergy sufferers often also have asthma which can be deadly
4486406 we used a speech stressor test used in a lot of psychology research
4486407 basically the participants each appeared before a panel of several evaluators who supposedly were behavioral experts participants had to give a 10 minute speech which was videotaped and then are asked a series of math questions they had to solve without paper or pen
4486408 the whole exercise is a nice stress experiment in the laboratory
4486409 the wheals on a person who was moderately anxious because of the experiment were 75 percent larger after the experiment compared to that same persons response on the day when they were not stressed
4486410 but people who were highly anxious had wheals that were twice as big after they were stressed compared to their response when they were not stressed moreover these same people were four times more likely to have a stronger reaction to the skin test one day later after the stress
4486411 late phase reactions also occur in allergic asthma and can in the proper settings be potentially life threatening
4486412 the results of this study should alert practitioners and patients alike to the adverse effects of stress on allergic reactions in the nose chest skin and other organs that may seemingly resolve within a few minutes to hours after starting but may reappear the nest day when least expected
4486413 whats interesting about this is that it shows that being stressed can cause a persons allergies to worsen the next day
4486414 this is clinically important for patients since most of what we do to treat allergies is to take antihistimines to control the symptoms runny nose watery itchy eyes and congestion antihistimines dont deal with those symptoms on the next day
4486415 that means you will also have less drug reaching the normal tissue
4486416 the results are actually highly dependent on the surface chemistry
4486417 in other words you dont get this result just by attaching drugs to any nanotubes
4486418 right now what we are doing is so called passive targeting which is using the leaky vasculature of the tumor
4486419 but a more active targeting would be attaching a peptide or antibody to the nanotube drug one that will bind more specifically to the tumor which should further enhance the treatment efficacy
4486420 we are definitely hoping to be able to push this to practical applications into the clinic this is one step forward
4486421 but it will still take time to truly prove the efficacy and the safety
4486422 how a business school education affects the personal moral philosophies and attitudes on profit and sustainability of students has been a subject of much debate in and out of business schools in recent years
4486423 while some prior research has examined the ethical attitudes of business and non business students no study has compared the moral philosophies of business and non business students who are at different points in their college careers
4486424 we can see if and how exposure to business and non business education might influence students moral philosophies over time
4486425 freshmen business students scores on relativism and idealism mirrored those of their non business counterparts as did their scores on their attitudes on profits and sustainability
4486426 thus we found no evidence students interested in business are somehow
4486427 if as many critics charge business school theories and education are responsible for a negative effect on moral philosophies or make business students more profit driven then we should have found a difference between the freshmen and the seniors
4486428 while it may be easy and convenient to blame business schools and educators for corporate corruption and ethical scandals we dont believe such arguments are based on the body of empirical research we found
4486429 we certainly dont want to suggest that ethical training in business schools is not important because it is
4486430 but we do believe the results of our study show that this blame might be misplaced and we fear it might misdirect the attention of educators who truly do want to improve the consciousness of their students and corporate america

4486439 the health region would like to extend our thanks to dr le roux for the care he
4486440 it takes about a week to two weeks to get that final number but we are hoping for that 15 to 20 000 dollar range we are also estimating that we had approximately 1 800 on the street
4486441 traditionally we switch blocks off and on for the street dance businesses sometimes dont appreciate the street being closed on friday so we try to alternate the street locations to try and accommodate the businesses on the street it probably does affect their business a little bit but we are very grateful that the businesses do put up with us we had nothing but great co operation from the businesses over the years
4486442 in retrospect the zero hundred block has always been one of our best blocks to have it on it seems like the numbers for some reason and i dont know why but we have always had really good numbers on the zero block
4486443 all that money will go back into the swift current community a lot of that will go to telemiracle this spring clubs approach us all the time for money kids sports groups and stuff these are some of the groups that we try and raise our money for the kinsmen motto is to give back to the communities greatest needs and we look forward to giving back to the communities greatest needs
4486444 the bands did fantastic in fact we are already starting to plan for next year and possibly even looking at bringing wonderland back for next year again everyone i talked to said they absolutely loved wonderland and dixie hiway if it wasnt for those bands we wouldnt have the dance part of the street
4486445 you better believe we will have it again i know people that book their holidays around the street dance everything will be the same for next year we always try to keep things the same however we are always looking for more ideas we are open to people calling and asking us questions
4486446 we were actually having a conversation about that and a lot of the new people were asking us that because the street was extremely full and crowded i think one of the things is it wouldnt be the street dance if we didnt have it on central ave in swift current it is a thought and we are going to possibly look at other ideas for the street but as of right now it is definitely going to be back at downtown swift current
4486447 they were not related at all these accidents came in at quarter after one and the street dance didnt end until two
4486448 the dance went extremly well i think it had to do with the security that they had they did a tremendous job on keeping a lid on things our members got tied up with two accidents one minutes apart from each other later on in the evening as much as i know they had the street dance under control and there were no incidents really related to the dance

4486512 you may surely eat of every tree of the garden but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die
4486513 did god actually say you shall not eat of any tree in the garden

4486522 people dont understand how important a snapper is to a punter

4486527 since when does being an auto engineer makes you smarter than scientists specializing in the field
4486528 we told him ken weve done this before but weve got better tools now a much better controller from hughes and a much better feel for the batteries weve got an opportunity here so he stepped in and took it on with a real vigor he was a bit of a visionary a futurist he had a personal like for that kind of transportation and was enthused about it he was definitely a good choice
4486529 our plan was to be battery agnostic take the best available and focus on engineering the worlds most efficient vehicle which would give dramatically better performance once a better battery came along
4486530 the goal was to do a new car in a new way and see how quickly and efficiently we could do it the process would be driven by a new systems engineering approach with a top down set of requirements and 36 months was our goal for a ground up car

4486545 ive gotten a lot of questions the last few weeks asking if obama is the antichrist
4486546 i tell everyone that i dont think the antichrist will come out of politics especially american politics
4486547 i can see by the language he uses why people think he could be the antichrist
4486548 but from my reading of scripture he doesnt meet the criteria there is no indication in the bible that the antichrist will be an american

4486564 it has been fun it has been a fun transition it has been a lot of hard work the biggest part that goes into it is just the translation of the information of the words and phrases the plays are all the same most teams run the same type of plays its just what you call them weve had a fun time doing some different things trying to get brett up to speed weve done crosswords puzzles weve done walkthroughs weve done cutups hes really doing a good job picking it up we have a number of guys on the staff and on the team that actually have been in the system that he comes from so you hear a lot of translating going on not just from brett to me or brian daboll but all the players around its been good its been a lot of fun
4486565 every time we get belgians ordering we get whoa what a crazy name because its really flemish slang that weve got on the truck
4486566 symbolizes the way that the flemish are supporting the rest of the french speaking community
4486567 in belgium they quickly become attached to one or another territory
4486568 they are then surrounded by the publicity of being either a fleming or a walloon and in new york they do not have this feeling at all or much sure they still have a cultural identity but they feel they are belgians
4486569 its true that when we discuss the matter we can be passionate about it
4486570 but i dont have any animosity toward flemish speakers certainly not
4486571 if i was living in belgium that could be different
4486572 if we can make it in new york we can make it anywhere
4486573 one thing we share across the entire country is the food
4486574 thats one thing i never understood i dont know how we manage to get such good food
4486575 when we look at what is happening in belgium right now
4486576 we look at it as sort of a provincial fight thats removed from our community in new york but i still see flemish people sticking with flemish people
4486577 if i look at my walloon friends in new york
4486578 they dont speak flemish a few of them do but quite a few of them do not on the other hand pretty much every fleming speaks french
4486579 its just when youre hanging out with your friends you want to be able to speak the same language
4486580 its much easier to hang out with french speaking people

4486887 with the settlement after years of misleading the public about the validity of the charges wilkerson has admitted to breaking the law

4486893 to the monthly it seemed that the matter of bill henson hadnt really been resolved the art community needed to inspect itself and consider the weight of the charges against it it also seemed that in an edition devoted to this subject it would be inappropriate not to have it illustrated in some way

4486899 how could you do this i dont understand why you would do something like this to me what did i ever do to make you hate me like this
4486900 outside theology and fantastic literature few can doubt that the main features of our universe are its dearth of meaning and lack of discernible purpose and yet with bewildering optimism we continue to assemble whatever scraps of information we can gather in scrolls and books and computer chips on shelf after library shelf whether material virtual or otherwise pathetically intent on lending the world a semblance of sense and order while knowing perfectly well that however much wed like to believe the contrary our pursuits are sadly doomed to failure
4486901 people think that because a novels invented it isnt true exactly the reverse is the case because a novels invented its true biography and memoirs can never be wholly true since they cant include every conceivable circumstance of what happened the novel can do that the novelist lays it down his decision is binding
4486902 truth is the same thing to the understanding as music to the ear or beauty to the eye

4486954 ive known for a while when i want to go out and as long as i put on a great performance this is my time
4486955 blackburn was a really great fighter himself there never was a shrewder ring general than blackburn joes success was due to following out faithfully the campaign plans outlined by his sagacious mentor
4486956 blackburn was a great lightweight who in other times and under other circumstances would have been a world champion
4486957 blackburn blocked side stepped slipped rode and ducked punches as easily and as calmly as we are led to believe that an aeroplane outmaneuvers a zeppelin
4486958 he got believin all you newspaper boys say about him that he aint human mr schmeling learned him something
4486959 see what im trying to teach you pretend you have a brick in your fist naturally the guys gonna duck then you hit him with the other hand
4486960 you wont have to climb these steps but once tonight
4486961 i guess i thought id be heavyweight champion forever and chappie would always be with me chappie had been another father a teacher and a friend so when you think about it i lost three people not one
4486962 its a totally different style i couldnt adapt straight away he had me covered
4486963 im retiring now its been a lot of hard work and heartbreaking being away from my three kids
4486964 my biggest aim was to make it here again to show people i could do it twice
4486965 they think were running complicated tools but its really easy
4486966 special characters in passwords are best practices for security gurus
4486967 smart phones are treated as consumer devices and not powerful computers that they are
4486968 we had a meeting and i said billy youre falling to bits you admitted on tv that youre physically beaten and told me you cant even swim with your daughter
4486969 the work has got harder for billy over the years and he has been a bit slower that is not his fault but he is in his 50s and cant do what he could at 33 or 43
4486970 i love billy but cant have a trainer who has admitted umpteen times that he is physically beaten how can i expect him to be okay for the next 12 weeks while im preparing to fight malignaggi
4486971 there is no way billy could have been on top form and continue training me
4486972 how do i know how hard or correctly im punching when he has needles and cannot feel his hands when were on the pads
4486973 he might say youre hitting hard but i would be thinking how do you know you cant feel your hands
4486974 if he thinks anything of me hell have a good look in the mirror and admit im falling to bits im physically done
4486975 i dont want to hear from my trainer who is taking so much medication to ease the pain dont worry rick ill get through this training session
4486976 it is me who needs to get through sessions because im the one taking the punches
4486977 maybe i should have realised bily was struggling a couple of fights ago but ive put it off and put it off
4486978 billy thinks other people have conspired for him to leave but i am the boss and make the final decisions
4486979 i have the best promoter in the world enzo is my manager and im working with joe so theres a good team behind me
4486980 im still with frank but enzo calzaghe is my manager through his help and with franks ok its gone well for me
4486981 they have agreed between the two of them that i can go and fight in new york
4486982 hopefully i will be boxing someone who is world ranked
4486983 i want to be fighting for a world title next year so i dont want to fight someone that i know will just be a pushover
4486984 i want someone who will bring the best out of me im hungry for it and whoever the opponent im ready for it
4486985 its a new weight and i think i will be a very powerful light welterweight im hoping for big things by next year
4486986 i said to my little boy that any boxers dream is to fight at madison square garden
4486987 now my dream is coming true thanks to enzo and joe calzaghe
4486988 it is a venue of legends and i will be boxing in front of millions of people track this topic
4486989 i knew they were going to give him everything he wanted
4486990 ive been watching the scoring here the first four days and i knew it was bad so i was expecting it i think they were giving him a score for anything and i had to work to get all of my points
4486991 i thought they were very generous to the chinese you expect a slight bias but you come to the olympic games and expect a level playing field
4486992 joe didnt box the best ive seen him but the scoring makes a difference and the tactics had to be changed because of the scoring everything the chinese guy touched they pressed the button for him
4486993 im very sad i thought i would be the winner i already beat him once before
4486994 some things you just dont ever want to say so i wont but it was just weird the way the scoring was
4486995 its very stunning and the thing were going to try to keep letting our guys know is youve got to try to keep it out of the hands of the judges thats a hard thing to do
4486996 all the ringside seat holders from brockton swansea taunton new bedford attleboro seekonk pawtucket woonsocket east providence providence and even hopkinton hope valley and wakefield climbed over the shoulders of the sports writers kicked them under the typewriter benches stamped on their typewriters and got up into the ring to shake hands with rocky
4486997 we all thought this guy cant even walk but i noticed whenever he landed a punch the other guy would go spinning like a top
4486998 all the other guys louis dempsey ali they all lost
4486999 he used to tell me nothing makes me feel better than to walk into a restaurant and hear someone say
4487000 he was offered 1 2 million to fight johansson which is like 20 million now
4487001 rocky wouldve knocked him out too he never wanted to fight patterson because patterson was quick but johansson stood right in front of you which wouldve been perfect for rocky
4487002 he was supposed to interview him but liston kept teasing rocky saying you wouldnt last two rounds with me rocky stayed calm but he was getting mad finally rocky said get me some trunks some shoes and gloves and lets see what happens rocky was serious listons people ran in like they were doing the 100 yard dash grabbed sonny and took him out of the gym
4487003 we were going to drive around the country and visit football camps ive always maintained that these guys go into football only because they havent been introduced to boxing the idea was to find some big kid and talk him into becoming a fighter we came close to signing jim brown but jim browns agent wanted brown to fight a six rounder with rocky then brown thought about it and changed his mind
4487004 ill never forget it joe louis and jersey joe walcott were crying at marcianos wake
4487005 walcott walked to the casket and collapsed he was crying so much
4487006 it was such a shock to me i didnt believe it he wouldve been my partner
4487007 can you imagine walcott coming to brockton after rocky marciano did a number on him
4487008 he was the first person i ever fought over maybe 22
4487009 i was real nervous im only 16 ive got no power i cant hold the guy i went in there and did my thing but i learned from it and it got me to where i am today
4487010 i had the psychological advantage because my opponent is stronger than me so i have no pressure
4487011 secondly my strategy is quite good i took advantage of my height and kept distance from my opponent
4487012 its a big weight off my shoulders now i know i havent got a medal
4487013 its been brilliant coming here but theres so much pressure with the training and not seeing my family now i can be back with my family and live a normal boys life
4487014 he has been preparing even better than me he talked to my parents and they cried on the phone but it was destiny that he couldnt get through i will try to do the best where i am now
4487015 i dont agree with the judges but i have to respect their decision and learn from this
4487016 hes got a totally different style and he just had me covered from the word go actually

4487020 spain came out and played really hard you have to give them credit
4487021 it was a matter that our defense controls so much of what our offense does
4487022 spains a good team they came out really well in the first half
4487023 in the second half we came out defensively and took care of what we had to
4487024 stuff like that happens during a game when both teams are playing physical you just step up hit your free throws and move on
4487025 i had to get a little treatment on the side but once it got warm i was okay
4487026 for us this was a good game its what we wanted to have
4487027 it was great when spain made their run and at the end of the first half were sitting there with a five point lead to see how were going to respond in that situation
4487028 the experience we have along with the young talent we have was a good combination in the second half

4487036 i think anyone is beatable but you have to cut your head off to beat bradely wiggins
4487037 to beat the french by half a second made it exciting
4487038 to win a gold medal as part of a team is so special and quite emotional
4487039 my first reaction was nothing special because i was trying to concentrate on the next race coming up
4487040 afterwards i saw it was a very fast time but for us its no coincidence that they made the final and then raced so fast
4487041 the french have been so dominant to beat us by such a big margin in manchester i thought it would be difficult in beijing
4487042 you can expect to win any races no matter how good you are we werent aiming for a 43 2 to win we just knew we had to go quicker
4487043 it was a big pleasure for us to make the final and its still a pleasure to win silver

4487051 its been clarified that the best way to support a sport that has a doping problem is not to throw it out but rather to help it
4487052 we hope we will be able to help the sport of cycling we hope that olympic cycling will be a cleaner sport than cycling in general is today
4487053 i think weightlifting understands as cycling understands that there is a huge risk for both those sports if the cheating is continued and continued to be exposed
4487054 the uci has been one of the leading international federations in the fight against doping which is not the case of some bigger federations

4487085 the start of an international discussion over the future status of south ossetia and abkhazia
4487086 unfortunately after what has happened it is unlikely that the ossetians and the abkhazians will be able to live in one state together with the georgians
4487087 before an international solution is worked out russian peacekeepers are to take up an additional security role

4487106 its a mathematical dilemma that the students have a six times greater chance of getting an f
4487107 other letter grades a b c and d are broken down in increments of 10 from 60 to 100 but there is a 59 point spread between d and f a gap that can often make it mathematically impossible for some failing students to ever catch up
4487108 counterfeit goods such as dvds may seem like a harmless bargain the truth is they are far from harmless

4487120 it has been this way for quite a few years and the increased threats against israel has not changed this

4487196 one area that many users were critical of was vmwares communication on the matter they were initially slow to issue public communications and proactively contact customers to let them know about the issue the thread in the vmware technology network vmtn forums that was started on this issue became the rallying point for many of the users who were experiencing problems as a result of the bug vmware employees did provide some updates to the thread which let users know they were aware of the bug but did not provide much other information until much later in the day another breakdown was that vmwares knowledgebase that had information on the bug and is often the first place users go to when experiencing a problem becamse so overwhelmed by the number of requests that it was unavailable for over 6 hours

4487208 the mccain worldview scares the hell out of me technology is complicated and the solutions we need are fairly complex they require an in depth understanding of the problem if youre going to formulate a solution and mccain clearly doesnt understand some of the core problems im still waiting for mccain to release a real technology plan one that helps consumers and addresses the problems were facing instead of protecting corporations and ignoring technology market failings
4487209 mccain has delivered his tech policy and its clear this election will determine whether america willfully becomes a third world participant in the online economy and culture

4487252 we have passed all of our inspections and received all our signoffs necessary for a tco we have submitted the folder to dob in order to obtain the tco this process usually takes about two weeks it is possible that it may take a little longer as many times dob comes back and says they lost a form and need it resubmitted

4487277 if we would keep four quarterbacks i would think we could keep five running backs
4487278 from our standpoint having all of us here benefits our team we can all do different things were our biggest cheerleaders
4487279 i probably should clarify things right now as far as the starting running back position is concerned
4487280 were going to use a number of running backs and the starter as far as im concerned will be the guy that plays the first play in the game not because one has earned the privilege to start over another itll be based on what we decide to do as an offensive staff to start the game
4487281 theyre going to play and obviously were going to have two players and as it looks right now its going to be lendale white and its going to be chris johnson and were going to interchange them throughout the game and back them up with the other guys
4487282 if there is a situation that comes up i will definitely look at it but it has to be something with the pats there is no sense in me going to another locker room when i have my guys in that locker room that are going back and hopefully trying to finish what we started
4487283 he passed his physical this morning and he is a raven
4487284 the thing about him is that the players all know him they all respect him all of our linebackers have been hit by him defensive tackle kelly gregg has been hit by him as a matter of fact he threw off kelly greggs facemask a few years back kelly still has the facemask in his den
4487285 nope ive never been under the knife and im not going under the knife
4487286 its day to day right now its a little bit more in depth than youve been hearing about i cant really explain it at this point because ive been researching it myself but i figure i might be all right
4487287 im not doubtful that reed will play against the bengals at all based on what weve been told by the doctors weve got plenty of experts working on it
4487288 dont put any stock in nfl com i dont think the story has any legs for any reason
4487289 i think we can win without him and i think we can win with him chris can play football i dont want to get into it that much because i think its unfair to a certain degree it would mean somebody who has busted their tail and been here the whole time would be out of a job i guess what it boils down to is the other receivers have to play if they show the team they can make plays thered be no need to bring him back
4487290 we feel like its important that we deal with a little short term misery and put that element of his injury behind us
4487291 i was impressed simply by the fact he was a quick study he was able to step out there and step in the huddle spew the verbiage out get people lined up and actually get the ball around
4487292 any time you put on shoulder pads and helmets for the first day its always tough i havent had a chance to put this stuff on since november when i got hurt so its good to be out here and good to be part of an organization like this
4487293 i texted him to congratulate him on his contract and getting back into the league i knew hed be fine im happy to see him back out there he definitely has the skills to be an nfl quarterback thats definitely not a question i was just happy to see him get a job
4487294 its something that will get fixed i promise because whoevers going to be back there is going to protect the ball
4487295 jacoby needs to learn to just get his foot in the ground and turn upfield more hes got to quit playing street ball
4487296 the sad part about it is weve addressed it over and over in practice its not like we didnt see this coming he wasnt even hit on the turnover against the broncos he just dropped it
4487297 im going to have a conversation with him before he goes on the field every time hell be the last one to find out what the return call is hell have to come to me and get it and then well go over everything he needs to be thinking about
4487298 were going to change him were tired of talking about it weve been teaching softly and now its going to get a little harder hes still swinging the ball around and we cant have that the bottom line is hes not going back there anymore if he turns the ball over
4487299 i dont want to push it too much in the preseason and set myself back so im going to be careful with it but i want to be out there
4487300 right now it hurts when i walk it definitely hurts breaking on the football ill continue to be limited in whatever im doing but i dont think its a big issue
4487301 it looks better than it feels its not as comfortable as it looks i got through it the pain is tolerable
4487302 my goal is to start the season and finish the season i refuse to come back early and fall short in the regular season fall short in the postseason
4487303 theres no rhyme or reason why were doing this in this direction
4487304 no coin flip we didnt want to do that again no rock paper scissors

4487306 bobby wade came here and developed got better and if he hadnt developed and gotten better the titans wouldnt have wanted him minnesota wouldnt have wanted him justin gage the same way if he hadnt have come here and gotten better he wouldnt have gone there to the titans and gotten 14 million bernard berrian if he hadnt developed he wouldnt have got 42 million with minnesota
4487307 i dont pay attention to any of that i dont really have an opinion or a comment on that they have their own reasons why they need to talk about things i just do my job and keep quiet
4487308 anytime anybody says something about guys on this team you take offense to it
4487309 i dont know yeah i suppose he can competitions all over this place you never know how its going to work out
4487310 i dont think weve decided whos who yet thats how they entered the game monday night but im not sure were at that stage with a lot of positions
4487311 im even contemplating giving some money back to further this thing along im ready to get it solved and move on the longer i stay here the worse its going to get
4487312 im healthy its frustrating to sit to the side i tweaked a little hamstring its nothing major i know i can still play and im ready to go its just frustrating sitting out here and dealing with this
4487313 joe is under contract and its our policy not to discuss particulars of his contract
4487314 ive come out a couple of times and actually played defense and chased him down and made him work to explode and cut
4487315 hes getting really close i cant tell you how excited we are about how far hes come in such a short period of time i have to keep it in perspective but were going to be very smart here and im not going to do anything until the trainers give the green light right now were still on yellow and were still working hard theres a little bit of caution but boy hes looking good and were excited and happy for him
4487316 the ball comes out on time if you ask every guy what we see out of chad that ball comes out on time receivers turn their heads and its almost hitting them in the face sometimes its amazing to see that on day one
4487317 whatever route you have you better run it hard because the ball could be coming if youre not looking you may get hit in the head
4487318 kind of that gong show deal it kind of goes to show you you miss some guys in the draft you miss some guys in free agency
4487319 i cant tell you that for sure and i dont want to say for sure generally when you say that things happen and then im on television saying this is what you said a month ago right now theyre our quarterbacks
4487320 not to my knowledge i dont answer my phone i have one i dont even have the number
4487321 i probably wouldnt want to listen to it there are probably a couple words i dont want to hear
4487322 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4487323 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4487324 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4487325 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
4487326 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
4487327 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
4487328 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4487329 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4487330 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4487331 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4487332 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4487333 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4487334 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
4487335 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables
4487336 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro
4487337 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
4487338 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
4487339 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
4487340 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4487341 it is possible that a nonresidential development at this location would alter the stability and vitality of the existing adjacent neighborhoods

4487343 generic drafts of potential court filings to individuals organizations and political parties who must resort to the courts to protect the fundamental rights of citizens to vote

4487388 we spent about 30 hours working with high school kids
4487389 that is when i realized wow dogs can help on a larger scale
4487390 seeing the impact it had on that community such a large impact i thought
4487391 trauma isolates people and these dogs can help break that isolation
4487392 after i came back from 9 11 i realized the handlers didnt have enough training to go through something like that
4487393 ive made a commitment to bring it here to frankfort
4487394 i would just like to have some other folks around just in case we do have something happen in the area i wont be going alone
4487395 she got up and she just looked at lionel and said
4487396 the dogs have to be team players they have to be able to follow the incident command structure and be flexible
4487397 the handlers have to be able to recognize stress in their own dogs and know how to read them the dog has to be comfortable in a hectic environment
4487398 everyone kind of forgot about the tragedy when the dogs were there
4487399 its hard to put your finger on what happens but you can see something happening
4487400 extensive scientific studies will be done on the body by a team of scientists including a molecular biologist an anthropologist a paleontologist and other scientists over the next few months at an undisclosed location
4487401 bigfoot has credible evidence that stands up to scientific scrutiny to support its existence
4487402 regarding bigfoot multiple documentaries on animal planet they were compelling in favor of its existence from the same source they were compelling in dispelling the existence of loch ness
4487403 multiple shows some of which tried to disprove the existence of bigfoot
4487404 it is simply too grainy to be considered incontrovertible proof of the beasts existence
4487405 it would sure screw up the christian right and their theory of evolution

4487418 the united states commends the government of cameroon and the government of nigeria for their commitment to the peaceful handover of the bakassi peninsula on august 14 2008 the united states continues to encourage the two governments to implement the 2002 international court of justice ruling and the 2006 greentree agreement we believe the efforts of cameroon and nigeria to resolve this border dispute peacefully serve as a positive example of conflict resolution
4487419 it is hard to imagine that anyone who loves nigeria will insist that we go ahead to implement the green tree agreement as it is in spite of the dangerous security implication which our military have pointed out
4487420 its heartbreaking to think something like that would happen here
4487421 i cannot imagine what would drive somebody to do that
4487422 when you go from extreme high water to low water that has a tendency to leave behind significant sediment and it shifts channels unexpectedly
4487423 when you have a flood you get a combination of sediment and soil coming off the farm fields and golf courses and streets and yards
4487424 also the energy from the flow picks up sand off the bottom of the river it swirls it all together in this milky hazy mixture that comes down the river during flooding
4487425 my extra tip would be to make your digg profile networkable by this i mean list all your network channels so that people can get in touch with you easily e g twitter gtalk aim plurk facebook and all the other usual suspects also while on the topic of profiles make sure to use and avatar friend requests from avatar less users are a real turn off for a lot of diggers bonus points if you use the same avatar across multiple social sites so you stand out easily

4487436 thats a disappointing way to exit the tournament when you not only lose the match but you lose a little faith in your fellow competitor
4487437 playing in the olympics in whats supposed to be considered a gentlemans sport thats a time to call it on yourself
4487438 fernando looked me square in the eye and didnt call it

4487850 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4487851 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4487852 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4487853 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4487854 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4487855 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

4487857 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4487858 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4487859 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4487860 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4487861 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4487862 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4487863 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4487864 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4487865 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4487866 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4487867 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4487868 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4487869 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4487870 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4487871 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4487872 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4487873 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4487874 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4487875 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4487876 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4487877 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4487878 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4487879 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4487880 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4487881 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4487882 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4487883 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4487884 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4487885 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4487886 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4487887 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4487888 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4487889 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4487890 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4487891 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4487892 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4487893 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4487894 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4487895 a criminal is a father of a brother and the son of the judge
4487896 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4487897 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4487898 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4487899 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4487900 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4487901 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4487902 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4487903 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4487904 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4487905 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4487906 who are open to doing something on the production side
4487907 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4487908 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4487909 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4487910 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4487911 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4487912 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4487913 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4487914 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4487915 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4487916 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4487917 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4487918 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4487919 i wanted to say what i wanted to say and i wanted him to know that despite being in a room with a thousand people who love him there are plenty of people out there who dont agree with him in any way shape or form

4487941 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4487942 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4487943 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4487944 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4487945 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4487946 youre never on your mat just for yourself you are in service
4487947 seeing is forgetting the name of the thing one sees
4487948 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4487949 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4487950 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4487951 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4487952 the good professor has spoiled my plans once too often today he shall die

4487954 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4487955 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4487956 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4487957 planning a wedding is very stressful its crazy my gardener is now invited
4487958 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4487959 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4487960 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4487961 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

4487967 the sailors know each other relatively well and theyre all in this together i think they draw on strength within the team that everybody in it is routing for each other and wants them to do well

4488043 these landmark agreements signal the arrival of utility scale pv solar power that may be cost competitive with solar thermal and wind energy
4488044 we will continue to explore such innovative technologies as we aggressively work to increase the amount of renewable energy we provide our customers
4488045 we are very happy to be working with pg amp e to help meet californias requirements for clean renewable energy and are committed to working closely with the local community as this project moves forward
4488046 our solar farms are quiet and emission free with solar panels mounted near ground level to minimize visual impact implementing cost competitive solar power on this scale establishes thin film photovoltaic generation as an important contributor to global sustainability
4488047 today high efficiency photovoltaic technology is a competitively priced component of utility scale peak power generation
4488048 our experience constructing more than 350 megawatts of solar systems on three continents allows us to deliver utility scale systems quickly and at a scale of hundreds of kilowatts to hundreds of megawatts we design our solar systems to maximize energy harvest while adapting to the natural topography of the site and serving the needs of the community

4488052 given cattle no longer graze horse butte at any time of year it is unnecessary for dol to force bison back into the park
4488053 residents across horse butte post signs saying that buffalo are welcome on their properties this year over 150 buffalo from horse butte were sent to slaughter even though there wasnt a cow in sight
4488054 bison are native wildlife in montana and are in critical need of habitat outside the park
4488055 practical solutions exist to provide native bison with habitat outside the park while also ensuring they dont commingle with livestock through their lawsuit the montana stockgrowers association is asserting that bison should never be able to leave the park even when cattle are not present
4488056 bison elk and other wildlife are doing what is needed to survive in heavy snow winters like the last one they migrate to lower elevation lands in search of grass this problem is not going away but there is a simple fix let buffalo graze on horse butte the montana stockgrowers association should be trying to work out a solution instead of bullying the state and running roughshod over the wishes of the property owners on horse butte with their heavy handed tactics

4488062 this is chinese territory you have to obey the rules
4488063 its up to the chinese government and the ioc to ensure media freedom during the beijing games and so far both have failed miserably
4488064 if the ioc is willing to acknowledge that this problem exists it should do all it can to prevent any more abuses the committee might also examine its own complicity in the problem
4488065 cluster bombs are indiscriminate killers that most nations have agreed to outlaw
4488066 russias use of this weapon is not only deadly to civilians but also an insult to international efforts to avoid a global humanitarian disaster of the kind caused by landmines
4488067 russia should never have fired cluster munitions against a town in georgia and now it should help in the clean up to avoid any more deaths
4488068 should airlines have a section of the plane reserved for parents with babies and smaller children
4488069 even a kids only section would not prevent truly unruly kids and their parents from being booted off a flight as happened on a recent southwest airlines flight to phoenix when a mother traveling with her four children was unable to keep them in their seats

4488085 we are confident that jackson browne will prevail in this lawsuit not only have senator mccain and his agents plainly infringed mr brownes copyright in running on empty but the federal courts have long held that the unauthorized use of a famous singers voice in a commercial constitutes a false endorsement and a violation of the singers right of publicity
4488086 in light of jackson brownes lifelong commitment to democratic ideals and political candidates the misappropriation of jackson brownes endorsement is entirely reprehensible and i have no doubt that a jury will agree

4488140 heels may look glamorous on the catwalks and on hollywood stars but theyre not appropriate for day to day work wear
4488141 these dress codes apart from being blatantly sexist can lead to long term foot and back problems as women are forced to stand or walk around in high heels or ill fitting footwear
4488142 we were surprised how many times we found that employers dress codes did not permit the wearing of comfortable sensible footwear by women
4488143 employers should look at encouraging their staff to come to work in comfortable shoes and where possible provide the option of sitting

4488189 i should catch the quartermaster just as hes coming back from lunch and feeling too drowsy to work overly hard at denying me proper gear for the trip
4488190 feed them and give them a rub down and see to it they have plenty of water ill be needing them again before the evening meal
4488191 come along lad i know the food smells good but our first stop is to get you fitted with some proper armor and a weapon that suits you for the road

4488193 that stall is a long standing fixture of the bazaar here in the caer lad theres an old story ive heard about it but the short version is they sell mostly roasted spiced lamb carved and served on warm soft flatbreads with a fresh cucumber sauce its very good in fact i usually eat there when my business takes me to the caer
4488194 i think i could sae that from the bowls of the folks what be eatin sir but the part im not about understandin is the lizard on the pennant
4488195 thats part of the long version of the story lad
4488196 now pay attention lad and watch close while were in there the quartermasters name is drummond and hes a sneaky one he hides the highest quality equipment that makes its way down here saves it for his paying customers if you see something that catches your eye that looks out of place let me know
4488197 again beggin yer pardon milord but i thought that everyone that served the duchy got issued the gear they needed and nobody had to spend none of their own money on it lessen they was stupid enough or careless enough to lose it i mean im not stupid i saw you give the stableboy some coppers fer tending the horses but i figured that you was just thanking him kinda in advance for doing a good job a job that hed be havin to do anyways do we have to pay extra to get good gear here
4488198 squire in a perfect world you would be correct the landowners and farmers would send their just taxes to the dukes administrators and the clerks in turn would see to it that what was needed would end up with those that needed it when they needed it unfortunately this is not a perfect world and since it does not look as though it will become a perfect world anytime in the near future ill have to explain a little more
4488199 the way it works here at my level is you have clerks who establish what you are entitled to in order to accomplish the duties the duke or his council have assigned to you
4488200 then you take the order of entitlement they provide to the different supply clerks that oversee managing whatever it is show them the order and make arrangements to get it to where you need it
4488201 when i first was assigned the taks of setting up the academy a large part of getting it organized was working out what my order of entitlement was going to include to see to it i could get it up and running and then once that was done changing those orders to just what i needed to keep it going from month to month
4488202 you werent a trainee there long enough to draw extra duty as a runner but i had a staff of four clerks whose sole job was to act as my proxies and see to it that our orders requesting materials made it to the supply clerks here at the caer and at the supply strongholds at barten and longcreek in time to have the materials arrive at the academy when we needed them but not so soon that perishables would spoil or wed run out of storage space for blankets or any of a hundred other things that could go wrong
4488203 one of the things youll have to learn as my squire is how vital it is to have damn good organization for your supplies if youre to get anything done
4488204 now were not here on the business of the academy i signed a change of command order yesterday that i sent out by courier to all the other chains of supply letting them all know that from here on out captain henessy was responsible for all orders of entitlement for the academy
4488205 and technically squire as i am not a native son of the duchy of doneghal duke arnghast is not my liege lord i have never sworn fealty to him and although he entrusted the founding and command of the academy to me he did so on the basis of my rank within the order of radiance and on my reputation and experience and above all else on what he thought of me once hed known me for a while now that i have reassigned those duties to the captain i am no longer an official part of the border guards and i am not entitled to so much as a cold cup of tea and a stale biscuit
4488206 and as you are now officially my squire neither are you
4488207 relax lars you are still getting paid and the bulk of it is still going to your mother i am a knight of the order of radiance and even if our order is not so very large it is still quite wealthy
4488208 when i made the decision to take you with me on this trip as my squire i signed an order to that effect and sent it to our chapter house in longcreek each knight is entitled to at least one squire and furthermore it is expected that every knight will do his best to find a worthy man or woman to train as his squire to ensure the survival of our skills and honor there is a sizable endowment available to help provide for the family of a squire and i added your name and your families to the roll i imagine you and they will be pleased to learn that your wages just doubled of course i will be working you twice as hard as youre used to so at least there is some justice to it
4488209 now the key to our situation here is that the whole reason we are making this trip is because the duke sent for me by official court page i have a letter from the duke signed personally by him that directs any and all of his household to provide for us what i feel i need to make the journey promptly and safely
4488210 and that means that within reason i have nearly unlimited entitlement at least i do so long as im heading in the direction of the dukes hunting lodge and i feel that in order to arrive safely we need to get you outfitted with the best armor and weapons available to make best use of your natural speed and skill
4488211 and here we come to the heart of the matter quartermaster drummond is a right bastard but give the devil his due hes one of the best around at seeing to it that what the duke needs he gets and just when he needs it too even if you wouldve sworn there was nothing there to find beg borrow or scrounge
4488212 to the duke he is a necessary evil he gets the job done better than anyone else ever has and hes responsible for most of the supply movements in the entire duchy but on the nickel and dime scale he is the greediest most larcenous bastard you ever laid eyes on
4488213 first and foremost if you have an order of entitlement saying you can draw for example a suit of chain from his stores theres usually nothing on any order specifying what quality the suit has to be sure and hes not a total bastard youre allowed to walk the aisles of his storerooms yourself to pick which suit you want but its a well known fact that the very good stuff he hides in unlikely places and if you want something better than what you find on the shelves youd best be digging deep into your pockets
4488214 catch him in a good mood say right after hes had a big meal and doesnt feel like working too hard at getting another gold crown
4488215 so you see squire that if we have to pay the quartermaster extra to get him to find proper armor or weapons for you we will but if your sharp eyes can spot any appropriate items that may be hidden around the place it would help us gain a bargaining position and yes before you say it i am as disgusted as i can see you are to hear that its likely well have to pay out of our pockets to make sure we get you equipped properly
4488216 but the fact is were fortunate we have money at hand to pay what its likely to take and there is nothing we can do to change the way things are until such time as drummond fails the duke in accomplishing his mission and as good as the small souled bastard is thats not liable to happen any time soon
4488217 now lets get a move on i dont want him falling asleep before we get there
4488218 weve been struggling but have been finding ways to win
4488219 whats been exciting is to do a giant comedy but at the same time try to be true to the mechanics of a sherlock holmes story like using the victorian forensics that conan doyle used
4488220 its a cool opportunity to write a good mystery that also gets to be a giant comedy fortunately a lot of the stories are public domain now we can actually draw on a lot of the situations and language of many of the original stories
4488221 looking around my desk i have books about victorian forensics all the stories and dictionaries for victorian slang
4488222 it looks like im writing a bad senior thesis on sherlock holmes

4488434 the more liberal camp just assumes that pastor warren is going to make this a christian litmus test of the presidency others who are more conservative fear he is going to wimp out on some of the issues
4488435 he says neither group understands or knows me hes going to ask tough questions fair questions not gotcha questions
4488436 its a great way for him to do what he can to make connections with not only moderate evangelicals but also the many people out there who read the purpose driven life
4488437 you just wonder is he trying to shoot himself in the foot

4488475 migration in east asia cases studies from japan china and taiwan
4488476 one of my competitors walking out said it reminded her of melbourne for the commonwealth games so there you go
4488477 i would suggest that in the long endurance outdoor sports you can see an impact these athletes are talking about seconds apart long term exposure in these conditions it can certainly take seconds off
4488478 i was expecting the worst and we put measures in place if it was necessary but it hasnt been an issue not since ive been here
4488479 its visible you can see it but it doesnt bother me
4488480 we were all going to be in the same situation so it doesnt matter at all
4488481 its the olympics its a happy day smog no problem
4488482 spain came out and played really hard you have to give them credit
4488483 it was a matter that our defense controls so much of what our offense does
4488484 spains a good team they came out really well in the first half
4488485 in the second half we came out defensively and took care of what we had to
4488486 stuff like that happens during a game when both teams are playing physical you just step up hit your free throws and move on
4488487 i had to get a little treatment on the side but once it got warm i was okay
4488488 for us this was a good game its what we wanted to have
4488489 it was great when spain made their run and at the end of the first half were sitting there with a five point lead to see how were going to respond in that situation
4488490 the experience we have along with the young talent we have was a good combination in the second half
4488491 at a time when world records seemed to have hit the ceiling of whats physically possible to wrestle out of the human organism phelps has been the man who managed to push the limits with his magnificent performance
4488492 any average adult human being needs some 2 500 daily calories to live a life without excesses
4488493 of course when youre in the presence of a monster like michael phelps those parameters can go to hell
4488494 the all time no 1 olympian or just one of many such belt holders
4488495 the latter is my conclusion because numbers of golds won is only one criterion by which to weigh olympic greatness not least because of the sheer number of scarcely distinguishable events open to swimmers though phelps will move another giant step towards the all time title on sunday if he puts spitz in the shade
4488496 we couldnt care less whether hes the greatest olympian ever
4488497 the truth is hes costing us a fortune and punters bettors just love him if phelps comes to london in 2012 theres a strong chance he could clean up again frankly were already dreading it
4488498 if michael phelps were a country he would be sitting fourth on the games medal tally
4488499 every olympiad produces its own titans athletes whose performances galvanize the worlds attention and whose names become synonymous in olympic history with the cities and years of their triumphs
4488500 in that sense beijing 2008 will always belong to michael phelps

4488600 during the late 1970s there was new thinking at the highest levels of the u s foreign policymakers and they reconsidered whether these ugly murderous military dictatorships of the 1970s were really the best way to preserve u s interests in these countries
4488601 this new thinking led to the establishment in 1983 of the national endowment for democracy they had chosen the german pattern in which the major political parties in germany have foundations financed by the federal government they did more or less the same thing with the establishment of the ned as a private foundation there is really nothing private about it and all its money comes from the congress

4488706 its quiet there but now there are problems with food
4488707 were in a difficult situation but our government is helping us
4488708 you know i am very ashamed we dont have a kopeck left and im so hungry
4488709 all these agreements are agreed only to be broken later we should not trust them for one minute
4488710 we have no idea what theyre doing there why the movement where theyre going
4488711 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4488712 i think the world should think very carefully about what is going on here
4488713 we need to stop everything that can be stopped now
4488714 that law essentially prohibits anyone from conspiring to intimidate any citizen who is lawfully entitled to participate in our elections from working to support or advocate anyone who is running for federal office
4488715 and we believe these letters are designed to intimidate those who may want to participate in this years election or support conservative groups otherwise
4488716 confront donors to conservative groups hoping to create a chilling effect that will dry up contributions
4488717 i think the doj needs to take enforcement action now
4488718 i mean this letter to me is enough to begin a federal civil rights investigation into this group
4488719 why is it that this group is able to send a letter out to intimidate people from participating in federal elections this is what the ku klux klan did in the late 19th century and this is what that law was designed to prevent and its a shame in this modern era that theres a group mimicking these intimidation like tactics which is threatening people if they participate in our politics
4488720 i dont think they are but theyre not required to under the law and neither are the groups on the other side who are conservative
4488721 theyre essentially just making threats up out of whole cloth in terms of accountability
4488722 i ts one thing to demand accountability and its another thing to intimidate people from participating in our elections as theyre able to and entitled to under our u s constitution
4488723 accountable america works to stop the outrageous policies of right wing and special interests in washington
4488724 not going to be intimidated by some pipsqueak on the kooky left
4488725 the very fact that bluecross blueshield capitulated so easily that doesnt say much for them as a company
4488726 at one point in society companies were more moral now we see companies leading the amoral rush to fund and subsidize and benefit so called homosexual marriages and homosexual led families
4488727 i fully believe that these two women love that child love that baby but the sad fact is that baby is growing up in a home which is intentionally fatherless by design and thats wrong
4488728 and thats going to handicap that babys life as she grows up she needs a dad and a replacement dad be it an uncle or some friend some male friend that these women have can never substitute for her having a father
4488729 both john mccain and barack obama i have known for a long time before either of them began to run for president they are very different
4488730 they have different philosophies of leadership different philosophies of where government should be and should be headed and i thought you know what these guys will probably trust me to ask the questions that let them say who they really are
4488731 the leader who says im going to take my worldview and just put it on the shelf when i make decisions is either an idiot or theyre lying because you cant do it
4488732 all of your decisions are based on what you value what you believe in life and so i think its important to find out what these guys really believe
4488733 there is simply no excuse for a presidential candidate to not honestly express his views on whether he supports enforcement of federal obscenity law whether he will take steps to ensure these laws are enforced if elected or if he doesnt support these laws to have the moral courage and integrity to tell the voters that hes opposed to these laws
4488734 i mean everything from crucifixes to talking jesus dolls plastic american girl dolls to plastic american express cards are made in china even the old glory american flags are made in china so its amazing
4488735 families have actually tried to live a year without buying chinese goods its impossible
4488736 i am a little dismayed at whats happened because people just seem to be turning a blind eye to it
4488737 but its mainly greed and ignorance the large corporations are making a lot of money including nbc i refuse to watch the olympics

4488744 90 000 for the city limits in the last reported year rates that approach 50 percent of all non miscarried pregnancies ending in an abortion here
4488745 our mayor flooded our city last year with 26 million free condoms given out everywhere and it does not show that abortions are going down or pregnancies are going down
4488746 positive step forward in establishing common ground that will lead to abortion reduction
4488747 some of these people youve mentioned and others that are like them trot around the country telling people theyre pro life and if we believe that and if we count on them when the time comes that we really need them then were going to be sorely misled and sorely let down
4488748 so i think that whats happening right now is that god is showing us who the people are that we can count on and obviously these pro aborts like the ones youre mentioning here are not people that can be counted on
4488749 the more liberal camp just assumes that pastor warren is going to make this a christian litmus test of the presidency others who are more conservative fear he is going to wimp out on some of the issues
4488750 he says neither group understands or knows me hes going to ask tough questions fair questions not gotcha questions
4488751 its a great way for him to do what he can to make connections with not only moderate evangelicals but also the many people out there who read the purpose driven life
4488752 you just wonder is he trying to shoot himself in the foot
4488753 the god strategy how religion became a political weapon in america
4488754 obama is going to make real inroads for people who want to be satisfied that this is a pretty religious guy but that hes not a lunatic
4488755 i think rick is in an unenviable position in that he stands to get attacked from the right and the left based on what direction he takes
4488756 as an evangelical i am much more interested in his list of questions than in either of their answers
4488757 we have around 135 000 people who have left their homes there

4488760 i dirigenti del coni il presidente federale carlo magri racconta di getto la campionessa italo cubana libenzio conti general manager delle nazionali ndr e poi anche i consoli cubani i tanti tifosi cinesi quelli italiani e tutti coloro che mi sono stati vicini in questo momento
4488761 la tristezza stata che mi hanno dato il visto proprio il giorno in cui morta la mamma potevo partire lo stesso ma ho preferito restare qui a pechino con le ragazze con la mia squadra per cercare di vincere questa olimpi da usa sempre il termine spagnolo ndr abbiamo fatto tanti sacrifici e poi mia madre non cera pi non avevo niente da fare laggi non ce lho con nessuno non sono amareggiata o arrabbiata mia mamma sa che con il pensiero le sono stata sempre vicino ho fatto tutto il possibile per cercare di andare ad abbracciarla per lultima volta ma non ce lho fatta ci avrei tenuto molto molto moltissimo andare da lei ma non mi stato possibile non do la colpa a nessuno e una cosa che purtroppo successa
4488762 ci vogliamo provare stare in palestra mi fa bene anche perch so che c tanta gente che mi vuole bene e poi le ragazze e lo staff che in questo momento mi sono state tutte vicine so che miglioreremo di partita in partita almeno me lo auguro dopo la serbia c il brasile e poi i quarti di finale quando dovremo essere pronte per le partite decisive
4488763 e una grande emozione tutte le volte che vesto la maglia azzurra successo cos anche in questa olimpi da
4488764 lo slavia porta da firenze un passivo di due reti
4488765 e vero che la partita iniziata in salita per noi ma colpa nostra se abbiamo lasciato segnare subito mutu il primo tempo in difesa non siamo andati male ma in attacco dobbiamo vergognarci la fiorentina ha vinto con tutti i meriti ma le speranze ci sono ancora
4488766 non abbiamo ancora perso giocheremo in casa davanti allo stadio pieno certo dobbiamo migliorare il gioco ed attaccare di pi il secondo tempo di firenze ci servito per capire come giocare contro la fiorentina per dobbiamo migliorare in tutti i reparti
4488767 ho alle spalle solo due settimane di preparazione dopo l infortunio che mi ha bloccato per pi di due mesi dice e non so se potrei essere utile alla squadra sono gi contento di potermi allenare un po e soprattutto di essere guarito tutti sappiamo che la fiorentina pi forte avremo bisogno di fortuna come l anno scorso quando eliminammo lajax
4488768 vinco con la juve e a 70 anni una nazionale
4488769 avete visto del piero e leggero e geniale far ancora meglio
4488770 c la grande soddisfazione per la risposta che questo gruppo compatto ha saputo dare subito abbiamo fatto vedere che siamo la squadra dellanno scorso che abbiamo lo stesso spirito
4488771 anche ma sappiamo che nel dna della juventus c la vittoria io questo dna lho assorbito altri i grandi campioni di questa squadra lo avevamo gi dentro un anno fa eravamo alla ricerca di tutto non avevamo nessun termine di paragone oggi abbiamo una squadra un gruppo compatto un gioco che funziona volevamo due giocatori per ogni ruolo e li abbiamo
4488772 ancora con questa storia la nostra campagna acquisti aveva degli obiettivi e questi obiettivi sono stati raggiunti e poi ripeto dire che questa squadra non ha qualit una mancanza di rispetto per i suoi campioni ma avete visto quello che sta facendo del piero gioca partite straordinarie leggero geniale quello dellultimo campionato e sono convinto che far anche meglio
4488773 non voglio invadere il campo di marcello per dico che una convocazione per legrottaglie e molinaro sarebbe una grande gioia
4488774 s sappiamo che siamo migliorati ma sappiamo anche che dovremo migliorare ancora un altro campionato e il ritorno in europa ci insegneranno cose nuove sappiamo che stiamo realizzando un progetto e che possiamo vincere anche se non sar facile ma non sar facile neppure per gli altri
4488775 il presidente un uomo straordinario ed uno straordinario tifoso i sogni aiutano a creare la giusta atmosfera aiutano a crescere noi vogliamo sognare ma non vogliamo creare nessuna illusione non sarebbe giusto la differenza esiste le illusioni si fanno con le chiacchiere i sogni si portano avanti con la volont di dare sempre il massimo questa la forza del nostro lavoro
4488776 per me lo quando firmo un contratto accetto un progetto non si pu firmare solo per assicurasi un ingaggio io sono fatto cos sento che i tifosi juventini lo hanno capito lho sentito forte un campionato fa a san siro prima della gara con linter quando durante il riscaldamento hanno cantato il mio nome e sento il sostegno di tutta la societ un rapporto di stima e lealt reciproco
4488777 non ci provate neppure di questo si gi parlato troppo
4488778 magari ho giocato qualche partita nella nazionale di b con tardelli lui s che aveva i numeri del campione e infatti nella juventus ha giocato via io non ero abbastanza bravo
4488779 lo vorrei davvero voglio vincere qualcosa di importante con la juventus
4488780 mi piacerebbe allenare una nazionale ci avevo gi pensato quando sono rimasto fermo per un anno e mezzo ma allora ero troppo giovane ora voglio vincere con la juventus e poi si vedr ovvio tutto prima dei settantanni

4488824 alcohol is a fundamental part of western culture it is the most controversial part of our diet simultaneously nourishing and intoxicating the human frame its equivocal influence over civilization can be equated to the polar characters of dr jekyll and mr hyde at times its philanthropic side has appeared to be in the ascendant at others the psychopath has been at large throughout history the place of alcohol in our meals medicines and leisure activities has been a matter of fierce debate whereas some cultures have distinguished it as a sacred fluid whose consumption should be limited to ceremonial occasions others have treated it as a kind of food and ignored or accommodated any incidental effects that it might have upon the psyche and a few have even tried to exclude it from society altogether such differing views have often been concurrent thus increasing the mystery surrounding alcohol in both ancient greece and the present millennium it has been credited with the powers of inspiration and destruction

4488864 he drank a lot probably enough during a twenty four hour span to render a minor league infield unconscious but he could hold his liquor longtime friends could remember only seeing him truly out of control drunk two or maybe three times during the course of a forty year friendship his fans knew the character not the man and when they approached him they often felt the need to affect being high if they werent already they had assumed hunter would want them that way but he hated sloppy inarticulate drunks he breakfasted on bloody marys and beer and drank wild turkey and chivas by the tumbler but he was rarely drunk

4488866 eventually though he became imprisoned by this image and as he wrote less and less he let the image blend into reality his first wife sandy who probably knew and understood him better than anyone got it right
4488867 he was a tortured tragic figure i do not think that he was a great writer i think he clearly had great potential both as a writer and a leader however he fell dramatically and a very very long time ago hunter wanted to be a great writer and he had the genius the talent and early on the will and the means he was horrified by whom sic he had become and ashamed or i really should say tortured he knew he had failed he knew that his writing was absolutely not great this was part of the torture and yet he could never climb back the image the power the drugs the alcohol the money all of it he never became that great american writer he had wanted to be nowhere close and he knew it

4488900 after his mothers death lewis instinctively cast around for other attachments
4488901 even when she tried to be kind he turned away from her but all the time he hoped shamefully in his childs heart that she would notice him and hold him and help he knew he needed her help or somebodys he scared himself
4488902 alice felt entirely cold she felt she had come to the end of something it was as if she and gilbert had been fixed in time by their childlessness and lewis and his vile damage were binding them too she wanted to be released she had bandaged his arm and wiped away his blood too many times fighting her pity and disgust while gilbert led his pristine office life she was like a nurse in a war patching up soldiers so that they could go out and fight again but it was his war and his fathers and she didnt want to be locked into his secret
4488903 dicky often hit claire it was his habit and part of the pattern of the family and it wasnt questioned between them at all
4488904 she knew she was in love with him he was her secret he was her imagining she didnt long or yearn or other things she had read about being in love but she had him in her heart sometimes she felt surprised that he didnt know it
4488905 seeing tamsin was more and more like being visited from another planet she amazed him with her blitheness and her confidence and he envied her he couldnt think what her life must be like or what her interest in him was and while he appreciated being able to look at her he felt no connection with her at all he would have liked to be able to join in he didnt know how
4488906 i can only do you harm ive got nothing you need do you understand nothing

4488909 the suffocating feeling left him and he felt bright and fast and full of something good
4488910 he walked along whitehall and into trafalgar square and the city was vast and battered and mysterious
4488911 he walked to the national gallery and stood in front of it it was unlit and he pictured all the paintings on the walls in the dark inside and it was a nice thought
4488912 the tennis court was some way from the house and it was a grass court and smooth and perfect

4488932 he would admit that his own youth had been marked by a great interest in marine life but that it came along with an interest in the red sox and latin twentieth century american novels schubert the democratic party and the catholic church his plan had been to pass all of those interests and dozens more along to the boys in equal measure in hopes of making them well rounded well educated citizens he did not mean for any of his sons to become ichthyologists he had meant for them at least one of them to be the president of the united states
4488933 tip was smarter and teddy was sweeter they had heard it since a time before memory
4488934 that was how he came to be so close to his great uncle father sullivan it turned out that the priest had stories stacked up like dinner napkins somewhere along the line teddys love for his mother had become his love for father sullivan and his love for father sullivan became his love for god
4488935 very hard to think of ways to keep ahead of his sons
4488936 the last moments of his ability to exert any sort of parental authority
4488937 that was boston on one block there were houses so beautiful the mayor himself could be living in one and three blocks away there was a housing project where it maybe wasnt always so nice but it was still a lot nicer than some other places
4488938 the sprawl of mustardy yellow brick buildings turned into something of a maze and no good ever came of mazes but there was a playground that kids actually used because it sat hip to hip against a better neighborhood it was patrolled with greater regularity the police pushed down hard on the nefarious elements and in doing so managed to hassle most of the decent citizens as well so the crime rates stayed down and for the most part no one was happy boston medical center was only blocks away there was a womans shelter a food pantry plenty of resources and yet every one of them was stretched thin enough to snap if doyle could have been the mayor again he liked to think there were some things he would do differently
4488939 there were some people who had the ability to tell other people what was worth wanting could tell them in a way that was so powerful that the people who heard them suddenly had their eyes opened to what had been withheld from them all along
4488940 a safe lodging and a holy rest and peace at the last
4488941 one of the deficiencies in american studies of the life of thomas jefferson as with roger williams is that they begin too late as if the subjects mind had sprung full grown without being influenced and without learning
4488942 my first lesson in professional acting and the unwritten rules that went with it concentration quick study empathy without identity which ensures control of the character a whole body awareness a sensate memory all of which i look back on now as some of the most valuable lessons as a writer i have ever had

4488946 was to sit on watch in the flying control room with earphones connected to a marconi transmitter receiver relaying orders from voices in the air to the flying control officer from pilots landing taking off sometimes lost sometimes with wounded aboard
4488947 taught me a little of that airfree security beyond bravery that deceptive control of the sky for a while that the pilots knew and that sustained them
4488948 under american law i had lost my citizenship when i joined a foreign army and so one morning along with five members of the eagle squadron americans who had joined the raf as pilots i stood before the u s consul in london and forswore allegiance to foreign potentates or princes i was officially american again all of us were classed as premature anti fascists a description in which i still take pride

4488957 chicago has come to be known over the country as a bad town for men of good character and a good town for men of bad character
4488958 newspapers printed scoreboards that tabulated murders and muggings as if such crimes were scheduled like baseball games and horse races a burglary every three hours a holdup every six hours and a suicide and murder every day
4488959 vowed never to deal with pimps desperate parents selling off children panders and white slavers
4488960 explained graciously patiently that the everleigh club was free from disease that dr maurice rosenberg examined the girls regularly that neither she nor ada would tolerate anything approaching violence that drugs were forbidden and drunks tossed out that guests were never robbed nor rolled and that there was actually a waiting list of girls spanning the continental united states eager to join their house

4488969 the train groaned into motion and pulled out of union station bell stared through the scrim of ice watching his citys slow retreat
4488970 by 1788 the irony could not have been lost on boone that he as much as any other single human being had helped create the world that was now repugnant to him so raging and relentless in growth and greed and he must have seen perhaps for the first time the contradiction and conflict at the heart of so much of his effort to lead white people into the wilderness and make it safe for them was to destroy the very object of his quest the paradox had been present in almost everything he had done and yet he had ignored or misunderstood it whenever the recognition came to him it must have been sobering for he had to see that his genius and his talents virtually canceled each other out wherever he went many others would follow he wanted to enjoy and keep the object of his desire at the same time for all his achievements and fame his kindness and compassion cunning and knowledge boone had made a fool of himself too he had acted the fool and he must have come to that hard view of his life
4488971 story and character stand up remarkably well under critical scrutiny
4488972 boones character has some of the resilience shown in history by his contemporaries washington hamilton they seem to be figures that we need in our history and in our image of ourselves and no amount of quibbling and skepticism diminishes their stature very much
4488973 boone has been thought by many to be virtually a fictional character subject of tall tales like mike fink the keelboatman or even paul bunyan
4488974 fifty years after boone explored kentucky and relished its wilderness for two years 1769 71 without returning to the settlements the hudson river painters captured something of his transcendental view of the mountains and rivers in their art boone saw nature as both fact and fable and every cloud and sunset tree and blade of grass as instance of both the real and the ideal physical and spiritual everyone who ever interviewed him mentioned his calm and his poise the sense of the spiritual was something he shared with the indians and likely learned in part from them like washington like lincoln later boone inspired the craving for an ideal self with quaker tolerance for others reliant and integrious with a large capacity for wonder and reaching out toward the new and mysterious brave but cautious sociable diplomatic calm in the face of danger a lover of song and reading a notoriously erratic speller
4488975 became widely known in the yadkin area as an expert trapper and hunter a deadly marksman
4488976 must have been one of the hardiest and most resilient and resourceful women in american history
4488977 the image of a man finding his way through a narrow gap into the eden of kentucky and leading others there guaranteeing that the new nation about to be born would extend over the mountains and encompass the west whatever other deeds he did or did not do this is the image that has stuck
4488978 his aplomb and steadiness ease and gracefulness as well as his marksmanship and skill gave him an extraordinary rapport with the indians
4488979 of famous white americans only sam houston appears to have had a comparable knack for fitting in with native peoples
4488980 a patriarch one of the best known men on the frontier
4488981 to write a book about kentucky and make a map of the region that would sell well and bring even more investors and settlers to the west
4488982 the old woodsman seemed constitutionally unable to stay out of debt
4488983 seemed to wax more romantic and affectionate than ever toward native americans remembering them as a people of honor and compassion
4488984 mostly the good things from his many encounters transactions and captivities with native americans
4488985 the mass reserve army made military service a part of the life experience of millions of european men and gave military institutions a central place in european society to recruit train equip supply and deploy millions of citizen soldiers required an array of administrative agencies complex and expensive equipment and an elaborate infrastructure all the powers spent enormous sums of money on their armed forces in the two decades before 1914 and especially after 1912 when an intensified arms race reflected the deteriorating international situation in order to build and maintain mass reserve armies states not only needed money they also had to be able to measure count and if necessary coerce their populations
4488986 blended emancipation and compulsion freedom and restraint empowerment and discipline
4488987 a genuinely national army is the only political institution that brings citizens together as citizens only in the army do all sons of the fatherland feel united
4488988 that their soldiers might not be able to shed the habits of civilian life and do what had to be done in defense of the fatherland
4488989 the war prepared the soil in which nazism could take root
4488990 created sharp political divisions severe economic dislocation and deep national frustrations
4488991 poisoned germans civic life accustomed them to violence and weakened their commitment to a legal order
4488992 promise of national rebirth breaking the shackles of versailles restoring national honor regaining germanys rightful status as a great power was at the heart of the nazi message
4488993 without germany there would have been no european war in 1939
4488994 nothing like this had ever existed in the history of warfare however voracious the first wars appetite for blood and treasure the second consumed much more more lives more resources more machines some fifty million people throughout the world died in the war far more than the first the second war engulfed soldier and civilian alike between 1914 and 1918 the wars destructive power was largely concentrated on the battlefield the overwhelming majority of dead and wounded were soldiers between 1939 and 1945 battle had no boundaries both sides intentionally targeted their opponents civilians who died in greater numbers than those in uniform during the siege of leningrad alone 650 000 men women and children perished more than the combined military fatalities of both belgrade had been virtually destroyed
4488995 organized for peace not war in them social change was translated into economic production not battle potential
4488996 the militarys role in the symbols and ceremonies had everywhere diminished
4488997 most of europe the overwhelming majority of people came to view violence both domestic and international as something to be feared and avoided not applauded or excused it seemed as if the experiences of the twentieth century had finally taught europeans that such turmoil was an aberration a pathological assault on normal society something to be combated and overcome like crime
4488998 an excessive reliance on military solutions the threat of preemptive action and the apparent disregard for consultation and cooperation
4488999 as a persistent challenge to domestic order rather than an immediate international threat
4489000 a sequence in song starting around 1926 and carrying on to about 1944
4489001 it was my good fortune that irving berlin cole porter george gershwin jerome kern arthur schwartz howard dietz and others supplied the music for these various films and stage shows yes indeed that was a fine lot of material to fall into ones lap
4489002 was of course a phenomenon unto himself every writer did his best work for fred because among other reasons he asked for it
4489003 about the whole country concerning which these songs provide maybe the most trustworthy record we have
4489004 the standards have actually been referred to as a jewish response to black music
4489005 but this definition is a loaded compliment that neither party has rushed to claim
4489006 music is not produced by whole groups but by one genius at a time and it may be significant that the two families that gave us irving berlin and george gershwin both fled russia on the same great wave of czarist pogroms only to find american black people not only singing about a similar experience but using the hebrew bible as their text
4489007 at least a part of irving berlin was an intuitive jazzman who had once heard the sounds of harlem as clearly as those of hester street and had so to speak finally hatched out the embryonic sounds of his early rags into the swinging majesty of cheek to cheek

4489009 if there had been no irving berlin there would have been nothing for instance quite like harold arlen either or jimmy van heusen or even cole porter in quite the same form
4489010 george did not consider tin pan alley a curse at all but a gold mine into which one could probably invest all ones time and talent including ones classical talent in hopes of finding a genuine new american art so he went his serene way alternately writing songs and concert pieces that ran together into a single sound that could be played in a pinch by a jazz band or a symphony orchestra or by some fusion of both that didnt yet exist
4489011 a labor of love not of scholarship which means that i have been researching it for most of my life without knowing it starting at the family piano singing and memorizing irving berlins ragtime spin offs and ending with the last phone conversation with the last fellow addict fifteen minutes ago

4489013 for centuries had taken in hundreds of thousands of babies abandoned by their parents at birth
4489014 that syphilis could be transmitted through wet nursing had been known practically from the time that the disease first appeared in europe and it was mentioned in a latin medical text of 1498 the constant contact of the babies mouths with their nurses nipples put the women at extreme risk as the nineteenth century french syphilologist alfred fournier put it nothing is so dangerous to its surroundings as a syphilitic infant with syphilis so widespread it is estimated that 10 percent of all the men in europes cities had the disease foundling home directors were desperate making the problem worse these women often caused wider contagion in their isolated hometowns at a public health conference in 1875 a public health doctor from russia reported that in one peasant community in his district eight women who had served as wet nurses in the citys foundling home returned to their own homes with syphilis and ended up infecting sixty people
4489015 lived in a little hamlet called oreglia part of the larger mountain town of vergato whose hamlets lay scattered across a vast area
4489016 she applied for work as a wet nurse was subjected to a medical examination and found free of syphilis then presented with a
4489017 what she saw made her shudder the babys body was malformed her chest strangely twisted and something else was wrong at the foundling home amalia had noticed that paolas eyes seemed suspiciously filmy now that she got to look more closely amalia realized that the baby was blind
4489018 not only wasnt paola eating but her nose was constantly running and more worrisome still began to emit a strange yellow fluid that ran down her lip
4489019 told the frightened amalia never to nurse the baby again and he made her promise to take paola back to the foundling home without delay

4489021 the defeated pope pius ix retreated to his vatican palaces as a self styled prisoner
4489022 the tale of amalia bagnacavalli is the story of people living amid this historic upheaval her story can scarcely be imagined any earlier in italian history it would have been inconceivable that an illiterate peasant woman could take legal action against one of bolognas foremost aristocrats and one of the major urban institutions of her time the bologna foundling home for all this to take place a host of major changes had to appear there had to be an established legal system that would allow such a suit to be filed and pursued there would have to be a crusading lawyer who motivated by a new ideology and social ambitions unleashed by the loosening of aristocratic control would champion her cause and there would have to be a change in legal philosophy in the courts with lowly workers seen as having certain basic rights
4489023 an enlightened elite whose mission was to transform italy into a modern country
4489024 man of strong convictions he liked to see himself as a champion of more scientific government a protector of the poor but he was also deeply ambitious
4489025 nothing but his own righteous anger and his long suffering client
4489026 did amalia and luigi react to this news did they use the rich palette of profanity their mountain dialect provided to denounce their erstwhile defender did they remind him of all the assurances he had given them over the years how many times he had told them that they should trust him completely
4489027 is that back then as today when the world of the rich collides with that of the poor it is rarely the rich who suffer
4489028 overlooks one of the most breathtaking vistas in the united states which is saying something
4489029 instructed his executors to convey to the national trust for historic preservation his one quarter interest in the park section of the estate the fenced in area that included kykuit in the hope that the house with its furnishings would be as he said preserved as nearly intact as may be practicable and opened to the public
4489030 it would seem that what he wanted people to discover there was not just nelson rockefeller but the rockefeller family as a group of complex interesting individuals each with his or her own interests tastes and personalities a family in short not so very different from most american families because of all he had done to the place since taking it over it would also be clear that kykuit had changed through the years and if kykuit had changed so by implication had the rockefeller family reconstituting itself anew with each generation just as every american family did indeed as the nation itself did ever fluid constantly evolving dynamically democratic
4489031 rising steadily upward from the valley it overspread the heights above offering glorious views of the river to the west and beyond it the palisades
4489032 modest and unpretentious no opulent palace certainly yet still beautiful its architecture and contents displaying the highest most noble values
4489033 the home not of greedy self seeking individuals but of decent civic minded people determined to do good with the riches that god and the american system of capitalistic enterprise had showered upon them
4489034 apart from the turmoil and temptation of the sinful world outside

4489037 by 1912 the estate covered over two thousand acres and had twenty miles of roads plus gardens and cut lawns a golf course a coach barn for horses and automobiles greenhouses to provide plants for the gardens and cut flowers for the family houses the orangerie and palm house barns sheds and livestock pens in addition to some ninety houses most of them rented out to estate workers following seniors precept that it was cheaper to have things done by his own nonunion men the pocantico estate was largely self sustaining included in its outdoor workforce of about two hundred were gardeners farmers woodsmen masons carpenters painters electricians plumbers tinsmiths and blacksmiths the total cost of running the estate when senior voiced his concern in 1909 was 109 200 by 1919 the payroll alone accounting for about half the overall costs had climbed to 123 628 90

4489041 the post war disillusion the new status of woman the freudian gospel the automobile prohibition the sex and confession magazines and the movies
4489042 a time of revolution is an uneasy time to live in it is easier to tear down a code than to put a new one in its place and meanwhile there is bound to be more or less wear and tear and general unpleasantness people who have been brought up to think that it is sinful for women to smoke or drink and scandalous for sex to be discussed across the luncheon table and unthinkable for a young girl to countenance strictly dishonorable attentions from a man cannot all at once forget the admonitions of their childhood it takes longer to hard boil a man or a woman than an egg
4489043 they may be roughly and inclusively defined as the men and women who had heard of james joyce proust c zanne jung bertrand russell john dewey petronius eugene oneill and eddington who looked down on the movies but revered charlie chaplin as a great artist could talk about relativity even if they could not understand it knew a few of the leading complexes by name collected early american furniture had ideas about progressive education and doubted the divinity of calvin coolidge few in numbers though they were they were highly vocal and their influence not merely dominated american literature but filtered down to affect by slow degrees the thought of the entire country
4489044 disillusionment except about business and the physical luxuries and improvements which business would bring was the keynote of the nineteen twenties
4489045 im not saying thats the definition im just saying it works
4489046 how is it that he explains wine so well to these people
4489047 there was much more at stake in prohibition than booze

4489049 defining issue of the 1920s one that measured the moral and political values of the nation while shaping the everyday lives of millions of americans
4489050 was less an expression of populist will than the product of political opportunism and a generations worth of aggressive lobbying
4489051 the dry movement appealed to urban reformers who shared the leagues desire to bring order and sobriety to american cities
4489052 seemed to inspire new yorkers not to change their ways to comply with the demands of the dry lobby but rather to devise new more creative ways to evade the law
4489053 he was convicted of forgery and sentenced to two years in prison
4489054 as quickly as the dry fashion had swept the nation william andersons vision of a dry new york had collapsed there would be no more celebrations and no further assertions that prohibition was ushering in a new era of clean thinking and clean living rather than uniting new yorkers behind a single moral agenda as anderson and his fellow drys had hoped the imposition of prohibition on the city had polarized new york between irreconcilable dry and wet camps one bent on enforcing prohibition at any cost and the other set on rebelling against it
4489055 added poison to industrial alcohol to denature it and prevent it from being diverted for human consumption

4489060 the views and values it reflects were formed in the bronx based religious schools i attended from kindergarten through graduate school a full account of the irish in america would include the protestant scot irish and the many catholics who settled outside cities as worthy as their subjects are they are not part of my tale the irish america of my search is the one into which i was born a cohesive urban catholic community constructed from a peasantry fragmented transplanted transformed and defined by the great famine and its consequences
4489061 was born in 1947 in greenport on the northeast end of long island exactly a century after my first paddy ancestor set foot in america
4489062 if there is any central theme in the story of the irish in america
4489063 it is how they stayed irish how an immigrant group already under punishing cultural and economic pressures reeling in the wake of the worst catastrophe in western europe in the nineteenth century and plunged into the fastest industrializing society in the world regrouped as quickly as it did built its own far flung network of charitable and educational institutions preserved its own identity and had a profound influence on the future of both the country it left and the one it came to
4489064 childlike buffoons lazy superstitious given to doubletalk inflated rhetoric and comic misuse of proper english
4489065 the stereotype became so ingrained in popular attitudes and perceptions that it passed from being regarded as a theatrical parody to a predeterminant of group behavior
4489066 the actor hoofer with the looks of a prize fighter lucky enough never to have had his face smashed in
4489067 expressed the style of the urban irish in its definitive form these jimmies had the blend of musicality and menace of nattiness and charm of verbal agility and ironic sensibility of what today is known as street smarts that the irish as new yorks first immigrant outsiders had developed
4489068 began the process of recovering from the shattering experience of the famine of unbending from the defensive crouch it had forced them into of building a new identity in america that preserved their deep sense of being irish as it prepared them to compete in a country in which the hostility they faced was interwoven with possibilities for advancement that had never existed before
4489069 just as black railroad porters were universally and equally patronizingly called
4489070 was about practical things about jobs bread influence about the neighborhood kid who needed a lawyer about the fees paid a subcontractor and about the hundred cases of champagne and two hundred kegs of beer waiting in the basement of the hall for those who endured five hours of july fourth speechifying
4489071 for all its excesses for all its thievery and knavery tammany afforded the poor what the rich and well off had denied them throughout history respect
4489072 the environment was sexually puritanical ritually demanding and often stultifying it was also intensely comforting and secure liturgically rich a culture of moral absolutes theological certainties and religious devotions in which the answers to all lifes questions were readily at hand
4489073 from an ingredient in irish life to its center the bulwark of a culture that had lost its language and almost disintegrated beneath the catastrophe of the famine
4489074 translated their numbers into control of the democratic party in the major cities and turned municipal patronage into an immediate and pragmatic method for softening the ravages of boom and bust capitalism
4489075 prime participants in the often intertwined professions of politics entertainment sports along with its less reputable sister gambling as well as a major part of the local criminal underworld which was not infrequently an ally of the local political machine
4489076 the simple fact is that while the macintosh is a personal computer the world knows that it is not a pc
4489077 with the broad white brow thoughtful eyes and features moulded into that regularity of strength which used to characterize the american senatorial type in those far away days of clean shaven faces and moderate incomes before the civil war
4489078 pigs wallowed in the mire before catholicisms base and burrowing into this base were a myriad of narrow doors each bearing the hateful sign of a saloon and giving forth from its recesses of night the sounds of screams and curses above were sculptured rows of lowering ape like faces and out of these sprang into the vague upper gloom on the one side lamp posts from which negroes hung by the neck and on the other gibbets for dynamiters and molly maguires and between the two glowed a spectral picture of some black robed tonsured men with leering satanic masks making a bonfire of the bible in the public schools
4489079 that his meeting with the priest and the doctor was the turning point in his career
4489080 evidently there was an intellectual world a world of culture and grace of lofty thoughts and the inspiring communion of real knowledge where creeds were not of importance and where men asked one another not is your soul saved
4489081 we were disposed to like you very much when we first knew you you impressed us as an innocent simple genuine young character full of mothers milk instead we found you inflating yourself with all sorts of egotisms and vanities we found you presuming upon the friendships which had been mistakenly extended to you your whole mind became an unpleasant thing to contemplate you thought it would amuse and impress us to hear you ridiculing and reviling the people of your church whose money supports you and making a mock of the things they believe in and which you for your life wouldnt dare let them know you didnt believe in you talked to us slightingly about your wife what were you thinking of not to comprehend that that would disgust us
4489082 as for the son of the slave woman i will make a nation of him also because he is your offspring

4489088 working was the one thing that forced me to use my mind and stay engaged with the greater world
4489089 i had trashed my own life trying to keep ray in it
4489090 ray and i were survivors at heart if we didnt laugh wed cry that was what we said half in jest half as a self protective incantation oh we both feared and courted our personal slings and arrows ray was only twenty two i wasnt yet twenty we were still forging the values of our married life finding a frame of reference that could give us bearings in a changeable world its much too pat to look back and declare as some would have it that ray was already overburdened and hindered in his writing development by his family to the contrary without me and christi and vance without our extended families on both sides ray might have had more financial freedom but at a terrible cost of lost psychological stability and support what we gave him for better or worse was the place to come home to
4489091 at the age of thirty eight i left ray because in my heart of hearts i believed that was what he truly wanted he was too much of a gentleman ever to ask me to go no matter what he said or did over the years he stayed in our marriage he never directly called it quits or asked for a divorce it was up to me to go it was probably the right thing to do even though the emotional cost was incalculable
4489092 as hammond observed in his memoirs as well as in numerous interviews he sensed from an early age that there was a reason this music was as deeply passionate as it was it was uniquely american music written by and played for people who had known the harsher realities of life firsthand in particular it was music by and for people whose skin color kept them perpetually at the bottom rung of american society listening to this music helped awaken hammond to the vast class differences that separated him from the servants in the basement
4489093 had been listening to and collecting jazz records for ten years
4489094 not only by being in the right place at the right time he was at monettes in harlem in 1933 the night billie holiday performed there he was at mildred baileys home in queens the night teddy wilson and benny goodman first jammed as part of a trio and he was in oklahoma city long enough to hear charlie christian knock out a handful of tasty guitar solos but also for knowing what to do when opportunity came knocking
4489095 the list of musicians he brought together for recording dates in the 1930s is staggering contemporary jazz historians can only shake their heads at the thought of walking into a studio in midtown manhattan and finding billie holiday benny goodman lester young teddy wilson buck clayton freddie green walter page and jo jones it astonishes me as i look back at how casually we were able to assemble such all star groups it wasnt that we didnt know how great they were we did it was simply a golden age hammond recalled in his memoirs
4489096 appreciated the rebellion inherent in the music but found the music itself impenetrable and ultimately pretentious
4489097 he was somebody i felt that my music was very safe with he just exuded love of music the minute he heard something he liked he was capable of expressing such enthusiasm when there were no clich s in the songs when its all you when its all yours when hes hearing something he hasnt quite heard before thats what he looked for thats what moved him a singular voice some sort of distinctive voice that came from some place particular and spoke with a certain sort of emotional force
4489098 wore high heeled boots and a top hat to disguise his lack of size
4489099 more than 350 million in the tens of billions today
4489100 his remarkably sunny disposition his broad smile and non stop good natured chatter
4489101 i shall remember that check as long as i live
4489102 it gave me the first penny of revenue from capital something i had not worked for with the sweat of my brow
4489103 almost thirty andrew carnegie was the principal shareholder in several thriving companies a partner in several more and a force in local business circles well known and respected for his acumen and his access to capital he paid taxes on an income of 17 500 in 1864 with an additional 1 tax for his one horse carriage a year later his income had risen to 38 735 5 6 million today on which he paid a tax of 3 655 again he was charged an additional 1 tax for his carriage 2 for his gold watch and 4 for his pianoforte
4489104 one of the most fascinating men i have encountered a man who was many things in his long life but never boring
4489105 mr carnegie is no smaller than napoleon but for some reason or other he looks smaller than he really is he looks incredibly small almost unthinkably small
4489106 the undersized outsider with the funny accent who had been uprooted from his home
4489107 battled his demons and insecurities in silence he was a master at compartmentalizing his life building barriers between carnegie the lovesick suitor carnegie the powerful industrialist and carnegie the man of letters disciple of herbert spencer and confidant of matthew arnold
4489108 spencer offered carnegie and his generation an intellectual foundation for their optimism their sense that history was a record of forward progress by arguing that material progress went hand in hand with moral progress that industrialization was a higher state of civilization than that which preceded it and that the future would be even rosier than the present
4489109 his success as a businessman depended on his adherence to the laws of the marketplace which because they were embedded in a larger evolutionary schema were as moral as they were inexorable the path of evolutionary progress he was following would be strewn with hardships and sacrifice but these were unavoidable in the short term if mankind was going to benefit over the long term
4489110 protests against the unequal distribution of wealth by arguing that the common good was best served by allowing men like himself to accumulate and retain huge fortunes

4489112 two centuries worth of the myths and ideals of american culture
4489113 jeans are the surviving relic of the western frontier they epitomize our present day preoccupations celebrity and consumer culture blue jeans not soft drinks or cars or computers are the crowning product of american ingenuity they can imply either democratic parity or the aristocratic hierarchies of status first they built the countrys infrastructure then they populated it with a collective identity
4489114 the name denim is presumed to derive from the phrase
4489115 jeans manufacturers were experiencing a strange paradox of the american marketplace they had a daunting image problem yet it was precisely that image problem that gave the product its desirability among the target audience
4489116 the clothing of a much less wholesome kind of boy
4489117 well likely be wearing jeans long after the business suit say has been relegated to the dustbin of fashion
4489118 over the past few decades competitive foreign manufacturers have brought giant north american textile mills such as cone swift and canadas dominion textiles to their knees indias arvind mills rooted in a multigeneration family cotton business has become one of the worlds biggest denim manufacturers and the number one exporter producing more than 120 million meters annually brazil now the second biggest consumer of pantalones vaqueros in the world is home to several huge mills by 1997 east asian suppliers had surpassed the aggregate output of united states mills producing 1 7 billion square yards in recent years turkey has emerged as another aggressor building at least three massive mill groups

4489120 mason never sought national office he never wrote his memoirs he made no concerted effort as best we can tell to preserve his papers even more important is the elusive nature of masons accomplishments
4489121 as the eldest son of a wealthy planter in a hierarchical society he likely would have acquired in early life an air of command an understanding that he belonged to a class that was expected to dominate virginia society
4489122 a love of virtue a hatred of corruption and a fear of luxury and an acute sensitivity to prospective tyranny
4489123 believed in a fairly broad based suffrage and in individual rights few did more to enshrine notions like freedom of religion or the right to due process of law in the american political creed
4489124 a man who spends most of his time in retirement and has seldom medled in public affairs
4489125 between the summer of 1774 and the spring of 1776 a troubled mason would draft a revolutionary manifesto the fairfax resolves serve reluctantly in a provisional government and help organize first a militia and then an army to wage war against the british empire
4489126 combined a succinct statement of the republican principles that underlay the revolution with a smattering of constitutional doctrine and separate provisions designed to protect individual civil liberties
4489127 as a moral evil debasing the souls of slave owners and storing up wrath against the entire nation for a final day of judgment
4489128 while mason cast a critical eye on slavery it was an eighteenth century eye
4489129 for purposes of determining congressional representation notwithstanding it was favorable to virginia
4489130 mr mason is a gentleman of remarkable strong powers and possesses a clear and copious understanding he is able and convincing in debate steady and firm in his principles and undoubtedly one of the best politicians in america
4489131 i realized that my main impulse for writing a book was to force myself to find out about things i didnt know it has always been like that the reason for this memoir is the same to excavate and bring into the light things i had forgotten or repressed along with the stuff that remained at the front of my awareness otherwise why do it at all
4489132 this righteous and inflexible man a brave warrior but not a professional soldier a war hero who shot down eleven german planes in the first world war a fiercely orthodox catholic and an intense patriot determined the direction and conditions of my life it was at least partly in reaction against him and what he stood for that i became an expatriate a political skeptic an atheist a liberal a voluptuary and in most ways a disappointment to the ethos he lived by and perhaps no more creditable than these a writer about art
4489133 art i now realized was the symbolic discourse that truly reached into me though the art i had seen and come to know in australia had only done this intermittently and weakly it wasnt a question of confusing art with religion or trying to make a religion out of art as some people are tone deaf i was religion deaf and in fact i would have thought it a misuse even a debasement of a work of art to turn it into a mere ancillary a signpost to some imagined hoped for but illusory experience of god but i was beginning at last to derive from art from architecture and even from the beauty of organized landscape a sense of transcendence that organized religion had offered me but that i had never received
4489134 no matter what the demands of self expression may be nothing is anything without fully articulate conscious form

4489138 a deep dysfunction in my australian nature i didnt feel altogether at home either in the bush or on the beach
4489139 i would have to leave australia just as he had done if my work was ever to go anywhere
4489140 if you stay here another ten years australia will still be a very interesting place but you will have become a bore a village explainer
4489141 i knew nobody and i felt lost a provincial australian in a place that still in 1964 tended to look down on australians
4489142 more at ease in the world and filled with delight at what its human and inanimate contents could mean say and create
4489143 never for a moment believed the promises of revolution now that were floating about all that messianic drivel about changing the world by dropping out of it
4489144 sensed then and know with a fair degree of certainty now that it is an illusion to suppose that sexual promiscuity helps create personal freedom there is a huge difference between the condition of freedom and that of accepting no responsibilities to anyone
4489145 the idea that there was something inherently repressive about old art as though the past were a dead weight that new art young art had to shake off
4489146 the past is pervasive it seeps into everything it is the very air that artists and their public breathe
4489147 i have never regained it and today looking at the ever more feeble efforts on the part of the art world to designate its latest products as cutting edge edgy radical etcetera i am not in the least sorry to have lost it some new works of art have value of some kind or another others the majority have little or none but newness as such in art is never a value
4489148 completely an elitist in the cultural but emphatically not the social sense
4489149 after all a cultural critic and my main job is to distinguish the good from the second rate pretentious sentimental and boring stuff that saturates culture today
4489150 i am no democrat in the field of the arts the only area other than sports in which human inequality can be displayed and celebrated without doing social harm
4489151 on the first day of may 1911 temperatures throughout england began to rise and everyone agreed that the world was becoming exceedingly beautiful
4489152 on 17 july most of the country was perspiring in eighty degree temperatures
4489153 by 20 july there had been twenty consecutive days without rain
4489154 two days later fires began to break out spontaneously along the railway tracks at ascot bagshot and bracknell
4489155 in kings lynn a temperature of 92 f broke all previous records for that part of the country
4489156 at the beginning of august the constitutional health of england was beginning to falter badly in the continuing heat
4489157 by late august lassitude had begun to further weaken the nations energy as the hot weather hung over england like a brocade curtain
4489158 fully enclosed bathing machine a sort of garden shed with wheels at one end
4489159 a horse a muscley man or even occasionally a mechanical pulley contraption dragged the whole machine and its human contents to a line just beyond the surf

4489355 this book isnt journalism it is filled with made up individuals composite characters and descriptions that do not match anything in the real world if you think something in here is about you it isnt and if you think you are going to make a big deal out of it ive got plenty more on you that doesnt appear in the book so think again
4489356 by the time he hired me he had cut so many corners he was living entirely among the curves even for a criminal defense attorney thaddeus silk had accumulated an ungainly roster of people who would have loved to do him in

4489360 it wasnt that grady trod a thin line between sanity and craziness exactly the line grady trod looped through the beating heartland of both kingdoms and in and out and back again on a lot of topics he was more than coherent he was sharp and insightful and perfectly capable of assisting in his defense thats the legal standard for being sane enough to stand trial whether the defendant is capable of assisting in his own defense but the closer the trial date came the less grady seemed to think he needed defending at all
4489361 the new woman of the 1920s who boldly asserted her right to dance drink smoke and date to work to own her own property to live free of the strictures that governed her mothers generation
4489362 the history of the flapper isnt just about americas first sexual revolution though certainly the new woman of the 1920s represented a dramatic break with traditional american values and ethics indeed the flappers importance ranged far beyond the bedroom or the dance hall her story is the story of america in the 1920s the first modern decade when everyday life came under the full sway of mass media celebrity and consumerism when public rights gave way to private entitlements and when people as far and wide as muncie indiana and somerset pennsylvania came to share a national standard of tastes and habits
4489363 aunt jemima the gold dust twins and the cream of wheat uncle
4489364 sexual and romantic revolutions in which the flapper was a starring player never really subsided
4489365 vast change in morals and manners continued in the cold war years to undermine the already shaky basis of victorian era morality
4489366 no lady ever sits with her limbs crossed and limbs it was legs was still a four letter word no lady ever lets her back touch the back of a chair no lady ever goes out without a clean linen handkerchief in her purse no lady ever leaves the house until the last button on her gloves is fastened no lady ever lets her bare foot touch the bare floor and so forth
4489367 she belonged to the first generation of americans who were raised on advertisements and amusements rather than religion and restraint they rejected many victorian era values and redefined the pursuit of pleasure as a noble goal unto itself

4489375 i love that unlicensed designers in new hampshire have formed a anti license league
4489376 every decision an interior designer makes in one way or another affects the health safety and welfare of the public

4489378 we sure have had a lot of terrible storms move through the area in the past few weeks
4489379 many markers have lost confidence in the system and even with ets out of the picture it will be difficult to deliver a wholly successful system in 2009
4489380 in the long term appointing a new administrator for these tests is akin to rearranging the deck chairs on the titanic
4489381 the testing and examination system is sinking under its own weight and it is time for the government to examine seriously how it can streamline the assessment regime and again make it fit for purpose
4489382 it is simply not possible for the qca to appoint a new test contractor to deliver the sats exams for 2009
4489383 the government needs to take this golden opportunity to completely overhaul its testing regime and in the interim should suspend sats for 2009
4489384 we want testing to work in a way that is not stressful for children and tracks individual progress
4489385 i am open minded about reform and i am not saying that the current system is set in stone
4489386 the wrong thing for us to do would be to suspend the tests in 2009
4489387 we think that continuing on with externally evaluated national tests is important for parents schools and education
4489388 ill only implement it following a rigorous evaluation of whether it helps children make faster progress
4489389 far from abandoning independent assessment i hope the new tests will allow parents to get much more useful information on how their child is progressing
4489390 our company really focuses on the energy industry and we need to be a part of it and we are here with customers we need to focus on serving

4489392 this crude machiavellian behaviour shows the way mugabe operates he says he is negotiating in good faith and meanwhile hes trying to form an illegitimate government
4489393 i think they are sending a loud and clear message that theyre still the mafia they were the sooner mbeki recognises that the better
4489394 the people behind this are the people in zanu pf dont want an agreement they are desperate zanu pf is divided between the junta who dont want an agreement and a small section that recognises the writing is on the wall and they have to do a deal

4489415 sin duda porque este ha dado el triunfo en un partido m s complicado me ha dado much sima m s alegr a por el sufrimiento y por c mo estaba el partido

4489419 en 2004 ten amos un coche que tambi n ten a dificultades y aqu en m naco casi hacemos primero y segundo si no tengo yo el accidente y gan trulli m naco es especial y puede pasar de todo conf o en mi mismo y se que puedo hacer una buena carrera
4489420 lo mejor es que en la clasificaci n tengas una vuelta limpia sin errores y que hayas ganado un poco de tiempo aqu o all eso es mejor que tener un coche que tenga dos d cimas de ventaja con la puesta a punto
4489421 viendo un poco los resultados que hemos tenido en las zonas lentas de los circuitos donde necesit bamos tracci n bamos bastante mal por los problemas que hemos tenido todo el a o y aqu se pueden multiplicar as que vamos a esperar vamos a estar tranquilos y vamos a ver que se puede hacer
4489422 con lluvia se complicar an mucho las cosas y el a o pasado que hicimos una sesi n con agua el s bado por la ma ana era pr cticamente imposible conducir el coche y eso que ten amos todas las ayudas este a o ser a una pesadilla conducir y supongo que con estar en la pista tendr as un buen resultado porque no acabar n muchos coches prefiero que est seco porque con lluvia no tengo buenas sensaciones espero que no llueva
4489423 s hay pocas oportunidades no tenemos el nivel necesario para luchar por las victorias en circuitos m s o menos normales como barcelona y turqu a en los que ramos sexto o s ptimo o en estos circuitos especiales como m naco o como puede ser valencia o singapur o como puede ser alguna carrera que haya agua en las que igual vamos peor que en seco o mucho mejor hay que introducir alguna variante que nos puede salir bien o mal la cosa es arriesgar y m naco es uno de esos en los que puedes ir muy bien o muy mal y ojal se d el caso de que lo aprovechemos
4489424 depende de c mo vayas de cargado si vas solo unas vueltas menos creo que aguantas si vas m s de seis o siete no aguantas seg n la informaci n que me ha mandado la semana pasada el equipo no vamos a hacer nada extra o es una estrategia normal y tampoco hay mucha cosa que hacer puedes ir muy corto pero la gente a partir del octavo puesto van a ir a una parada como hicieron el a o pasado y sales detr s de uno de esos coches que va a la vuelta cuarenta y acabas ah la carrera as que m s o menos hay que hacer una cosa un poco l gica
4489425 m naco es diferente porque la importancia del piloto se incrementa un poco
4489426 quiz s pasa a ser un cincuenta por ciento est claro que un super aguri no hubiera podido ganar en m naco eso lo sabemos todos pero tambi n sabemos que es m s f cil cometer errores es m s f cil tener un error en la calificaci n y perder un par de d cimas en alg n sitio puedes mejorar el reglaje del coche para que te d tres d cimas y luego puedes perder medio segundo con un error es m s importante hacer una vuelta limpia para el piloto que tener bien reglado el coche
4489427 con las nuevas normas no hay tiempo para reaccionar y si te toca unas pocas vueltas antes de repostar tienes un problema mientras que si sale cuando ya has repostado puedes hasta ganar la carrera es una cosa bastante dif cil de predecir pero es algo en lo que debemos pensar
4489428 seguramente rafa es el principal favorito ganar tres t tulos consecutivos en par s es un gran xito para un chico tan joven pero este a o la situaci n es bastante diferente y ser interesante ver qui n va a ganar
4489429 siempre he intentado dar m s variedad a mi juego he estado trabajando en eso ltimamente y estoy muy contento con los progresos que he conseguido he mejorado mucho la volea y ahora puedo cambiar el ritmo en diferentes momentos del partido lo que es muy importante para roland garros
4489430 como el tercer jugador del mundo tengo m s presi n de la que sol a unas expectativas mayores en la mayor a de los partidos que juego soy el favorito pero me gusta ese papel es algo nuevo para m es un desaf o y hasta ahora lo llevo muy bien

4489457 do you withhold the fish treat when they miss the jump over the rope
4489458 do you have to yell at em to get them moving in the right direction
4489459 do they get a smack on the tail when they dont do the right thing
4489460 so youre saying youd make them hungry and anxious by withholding their food and youd yell at them and get nasty with them to make them angry with us and then you expect us to get in the pool and swim with them
4489461 it has to do with open lines of communication and servant leadership and playing to employee strengths
4489462 they describe the management as caring and the work environment as family like they applaud the amount of communication mcelveen and murray have with employees

4489467 in dethlefs sparsely decorated cubicle there is a photocopied motivational chart entitled guide to success after pulling it off the wall he points to one side where it says employee satisfaction in big black letters

4489478 i think its imperative that the following step be taken the president should have already and should do so very quickly convene the presidents working group on financial markets thats something that he can ask the secretary of the treasury to do this has to be coordinated across markets with the regulators here and obviously with regulators and central banks around the world
4489479 t he banking problems in the united states continue to mount while the federal governments deficit continues to soar out of control
4489480 when central banks intervene in the currency markets they exchange their currency for dollars
4489481 on july 16 2008 the federal reserve reported holding 2 349 billion of us government paper in custody for central banks in its report released today this amount had grown over the past three weeks to 2 401 billion a 38 4 annual rate of growth so central banks were accumulating dollars over the past three weeks at a rate far above what one would expect as a result of the us trade deficit the logical conclusion is that they were intervening in currency markets they were buying dollars for the purpose of propping it up to keep the dollar from falling off the edge of the cliff and doing so ignited a short covering rally which is not too difficult to do given the leverage employed in the markets these days by hedge funds and others
4489482 theres a crisis in the white house and to save the election theyd have to fake a war
4489483 what happened on the night of aug 7 is beyond comprehension the georgian military attacked the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali with multiple rocket launchers designed to devastate large areas russia had to respond to accuse it of aggression against small defenseless georgia is not just hypocritical but shows a lack of humanity the georgian leadership could do this only with the perceived support and encouragement of a much more powerful force
4489484 the u s has long been involved in supporting freedom movements throughout this region that have been attempting to replace russian influence with u s corporate control the cia national endowment for democracy and freedom house includes zbigniew brzezinski former cia director james woolsey and obama foreign policy adviser anthony lake have been key funders and supporters of placing politicians in power throughout central asia that would play ball with our side none of this is about the good guys versus the bad guys it is power bloc politics big money is at stake b oth parties republican and democrat share a bi partisan history and agenda of advancing corporate interests in this part of the world obamas advisers just like mccains one of his top advisers was recently a lobbyist for the current government in georgia are thick in this stew
4489485 washingtons bloody fingerprints are all over the invasion of south ossetia georgia president mikhail saakashvili would never dream of launching a massive military attack unless he got explicit orders from his bosses at 1600 pennsylvania ave after all saakashvili owes his entire political career to american power brokers and us intelligence agencies if he disobeyed them hed be gone in a fortnight besides an operation like this takes months of planning and logistical support especially if its perfectly timed to coincide with the beginning of the olympic games another petty neocon touch that means pentagon planners must have been working hand in hand with georgian generals for months in advance nothing was left to chance

4489525 lately ive been enjoying the collaborative cycling blog run in part by former chicagoan leonard basobas as someone who admittedly doesnt follow the nrc much except for when its racing nearby this fans point of view is useful for staying abreast of the various personalities and storylines

4489554 the announcement of sas to divest and sell its stake in airbaltic does not change the current growth and development strategy of the airline flick has so far refused further comment but the imminent departure of such a major shareholder with extensive expertise and aviation resources cannot fail to have some effect and the question now turns to who will buy sass stake and at what price transport minister ainars slesers spokesman girts dripe told the baltic news service that the sas announcement was not related with the governments decision not to privatize airbaltics shares as much as with differing opinions about the future development of the company however when the baltic times contacted sas in stockholm spokeswoman elisabeth manzi told us that slesers position was incorrect and that the reason for the sale was clear the latvian state has decided not to privatize airbaltic this means sas cannot become the majority shareholder and so the board of sas decided to sell our share

4489561 there are few good alternatives to the beam control provided by conventional lighting fixtures in the theatre
4489562 none have the beam control that theatrical fixtures such as the leko and fresnel have
4489563 uses a seven color system to achieve a wide spectrum of colors that include the pastel range
4489564 the ideal led powered theatrical lighting fixture would not just save energy it would save labor costs in several ways lamp life could be extended far beyond the hour rating of a standard theatre fixture saving lamp replacement labor and the associated trouble shootinig time if an led fixture had a color mixing method that could achieve the color range of gel there would be no need for the labor expense of color changes the heat generated by dozens of lighting fixtures would not compete strenuously with the air conditioning therefore saving energy costs another cost saving benefit of led fixtures is the elimination of conventional dimmers led fixtures could have efficient on board dimming that only requires line voltage and a control signal

4489577 that spring i realized that i had fallen deeply in love with a boy whom id known for only a short while don bachardy
4489578 the 30 year difference in our ages shocked some of those who knew us i myself didnt feel guilty about this but i did feel awed by the emotional intensity of our relationship right from the beginning the strange sense of a fated mutual discovery
4489579 its our fault as hitters we had a chance to add on runs and didnt

4489585 before he was all cutters and sliders he kept hitters off balance
4489586 he kept people off the plate and his velocity was up i saw a lot of the things i saw before but he might have had a more of their guys off balance
4489587 yes there are political dynamics we are working to sort them out
4489588 we want to end the conflict that claimed 120 000 lives on both sides over the last four decades

4489591 hij moet op school aandacht vragen voor het mediabeleid het opstellen en naleven van mediaprotocollen ook is het de bedoeling dat hij leerlingen leert omgaan met de computer en het mobieltje daarnaast moet hij in staat zijn ouderavonden te geven over de omgang met media uiteindelijk is het de taak van zon coach het thema op de agenda houden
4489592 niet overal is er voldoende bewustwording de ontwikkelingen gaan zo snel dat het voor de generaties van voor 1980 moeilijk is die bij te houden mijn 13 jarige zoon heeft bijvoorbeeld net een ipod het lukt hem sneller muzieknummers erop te krijgen dan zijn vader ouderen staan snel op technische achterstand daarom is het goed dat opvoeders bewust het gesprek met kinderen over media op gang houden of het nu een vader is met zijn zoon of een docent met zijn leerling
4489593 dat is inderdaad een probleem op een ouderavond kan ik als mediacoach wel praktische tips geven niet te snel alleen iets verbieden maar juist uitleggen waarom iets niet door de beugel kan blijf in contact stel je op de hoogte en kijk mee met je kinderen en wat ouders misschien niet kunnen mogen we wel van leerkrachten verwachten zij zijn professionals
4489594 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4489595 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4489596 the other hotels around the area all have health care that is provided by the boss and have been able to get wage increases

4489600 disneyland is being unfair with us because were fighting for our health care and theyre trying to take it away
4489601 theyre trying to cut our hours and take away our seniority
4489602 the most important is health care we need that and they want to take it away
4489603 at the end of the day what it means is that workers are going to be priced out of health care
4489604 we do remain hopeful that we can reach an agreement thats both fair and equitable providing that union leadership is reasonable and realistic in its approach
4489605 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4489606 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4489607 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

4489611 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4489612 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4489613 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4489614 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4489615 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4489616 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4489617 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4489618 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4489619 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4489620 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4489621 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4489622 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4489623 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4489624 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4489625 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4489626 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4489627 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4489628 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4489629 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4489630 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4489631 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4489632 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4489633 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4489634 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4489635 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4489636 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

4489652 i live in costa rica ek70rc at this low latitude propagation is significantly different than in the states i have been having a lot of fun exploring those differences i recently downloaded and installed
4489653 while monitoring the noaa space weather web site i discovered that when a boundary crossing occurs there seems to be a mode switch in the propagation i see here in costa rica if the

4489658 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4489659 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4489660 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4489661 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4489662 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4489663 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4489664 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4489665 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4489666 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4489667 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4489668 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4489669 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4489670 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4489671 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4489672 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4489673 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4489674 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4489675 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

4489681 i think its crucial these days to share knowledge and insure that what we know and what the producer knows is kind of aligned
4489682 those who survive will be the ones having their animal health under control
4489683 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4489684 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4489685 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4489686 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4489687 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4489688 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4489689 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

4489693 the akasa omega has been a pleasure to work with from start to finish and i feel it is without a shadow of a doubt the single easiest case to build a system into currently available the brilliant motherboard tray design makes such a huge difference when building your system and for those who frequently tinker inside their machines its of enormous advantage the build quality throughout the omega is equally excellent and is a breath of fresh air after so many recent cases weve reviewed have struggled to just get panels to line up properly

4489713 it has become increasingly difficult to shift property and some sellers seem reluctant to fork out money to have these problems rectified
4489714 buyers should thoroughly inspect the property before making an offer ask sellers to move furniture lift floor coverings and check that heating water and electricity is in working order
4489715 in readiness for their completion date all buyers should ensure they have the right level of home insurance including emergency cover as this can save them a small fortune in the event they should unearth a problem they had not anticipated

4489836 afterward she and j t had a very nice conversation and began sorting through some of their issues
4489837 he apologized profusely for the months he spent bombarding her with dozens of text messages and voice mails but assured her he did it out of love and because he missed her so much
4489838 its something that weve wanted to do and we want it to be legal and we are very very excited

4489847 rationalize the current patchwork of temporary tax credits that provide commercial feasibility
4489848 celtic and rangers up there are like manchester united chelsea arsenal and liverpool down here
4489849 but its even greater because they have 60 000 supporters every week whereas the rest while aberdeen might have 15 000 but some getting 3 000 or 4 000
4489850 that puts it into context so with all due respect to the premier league i think everyone else should be a little bit closer to the big four and should be more competitive
4489851 and they are because every team in the premier league can more than give the big four a game on any given day
4489852 our goal this year has got to be that on every saturday we are competitive we have to make sure were not getting rolled over 4 0 or 5 0 every week and players are deflated not feeling like they can cope im pretty sure that is not going to happen and that we will be competitive most weeks
4489853 some weeks we might lose 4 0 but i would suggest it will be because we go chasing a game that were 2 0 down in take a gamble and leave ourselves a bit vulnerable
4489854 i cant say how every game is going to go but you have to have a belief going to arsenal that you can win otherwise you might as well not bother turning up
4489855 im interested in good relations between the united states and russia but in the 21st century nations dont invade other nations

4489873 comer una alimentaci n alta en az car tiene efectos en el cuerpo en las emociones y en la capacidad de funcionar de las personas
4489874 los cereales integrales son los que generan mayor armon a y deber an ser la base de la alimentaci n porque contienen una cantidad muy importante de vitamina b que regula el sistema nervioso y a su vez permite que se sintetice un amino cido precursor de la serotonina el que tiene que ver con los estados depresivos la falta de serotonina genera depresi n entonces comer cereales integrales influye directamente en la posibilidad de que una persona est deprimida o no lo est
4489875 para endulzar la mejor elecci n son los edulcorantes que contienen maltosa los que est n pr ximos a los cereales integrales como el jarabe o miel de arroz y de cebada porque se descomponen lentamente en el est mago y los intestinos y no afectan dram ticamente los az cares de la sangre as se evita la monta a rusa de energ a y oscilaci n de humor que proviene del az car adem s cuando consumimos grandes cantidades de prote na y az car se produce un efecto acidificante y el cuerpo en su necesidad de recuperar el equilibrio re ne el calcio de los huesos y dientes calcio mineral alcalino para contrarrestar el efecto acidificante
4489876 hay una forma de alimentarse que est directamente apuntada a generar un estado de mayor armon a basada en cereales integrales verduras legumbres semillas frutas y algunos az cares de buena calidad y un poco de prote na animal tal como indica la pir mide nutricional dice racauchi es una alimentaci n que hace que este equilibrio emocional exista y se mantenga

4489884 original sins deniers like to claim that the doctrine does bad things or at least discourages us from doing good things it deals death so they tell us but over and over in jacobs account we meet well intentioned characters only to find their happier gentler anthropologies turning sour leading to or at least abetting anarchy eugenics despair perhaps the greatest irony in this history is the discovery that knowledge of original sin gives life by revealing us to ourselves yes but also by grounding a sense of universal human kinship truly a revolutionary thought that the roots of our common humanity might be found not in our dignity or even our potential but in our depravity
4489885 the canadian dollar is rallying on the back of better than expected manufacturing data

4489892 but from my reading of scripture he doesnt meet the criteria there is no indication in the bible that the antichrist will be an american

4489894 they want to get obamas negatives up but the country doesnt want to hear it
4489895 if we run that kind of campaign obama could win by a landslide
4489896 youd think wed be having a serious debate but so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton and britney spears i do have to ask my opponent is that the best you can come up with is that really what this election is about is that what is worthy of the american people
