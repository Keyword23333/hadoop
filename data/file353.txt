3530000 if they wish to ask for a review they must do this themselves in writing
3530001 contributed to the circumstances which gave rise to the injury
3530002 old prejudices like if a woman is wearing a short skirt or acting in a certain way are still operational
3530003 by reducing compensation because a woman has been drinking the cica is operating under those old prejudices
3530004 the scheme was originally applied wrongly in this case but this was corrected at review and the award was paid in full
3530005 it is not our policy to reduce the level of award to a victim of rape due to alcohol consumption this supports our view that a victim of rape is not in anyway culpable due to alcohol consumption
3530006 a victim of rape should not have any compensation reduced because of their drinking i hope that the compensation authority will look at these other cases
3530007 there was nothing untowards about the weather and they were quite close to shore so what happened is a mystery
3530008 perception of crime tends to be affected most by television and newspaper coverage while at local level it tends to be more informed by a residents own experiences of the area
3530009 there is a tendency for residents to overstate crime with non criminal antisocial behaviour often mistakenly viewed by local residents as examples of criminal behaviour
3530010 any community experiencing high levels of crime is at a disadvantage and faces a greater challenge in creating a quality of life offer that is important to longer term sustainability
3530011 paid a high price for the progress that we have made
3530012 she was conscientious to the point of doggedness and delivered quality reports on time she had a quality of making other people think that they were funny and clever and a knack of getting them to do her bidding
3530013 and when he was at the place he said unto them pray that ye enter not into temptation
3530014 and being in an agony he prayed more earnestly and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground
3530015 david has been very clear all along that the play is complete fiction unlike stuff happens and the permanent way it is not a documentary play it is fiction a theatrical and imaginative response to the governing class
3530016 like a four year old trying to hit the bell on a test your strength machine
3530017 through a series of freak occurrences a group of actors shooting a big budget war movie are forced to become the soldiers they are portraying
3530018 it was even worse than the hateful stuff they used in promoting it
3530019 an r rated comedy that satirizes hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters in ridiculous situations
3530020 its never funny when good and decent human beings are humiliated
3530021 in fact it is dangerous and disgusting this film is all that and more
3530022 it was frankly a mess it was crammed floor to ceiling with art works they were stuffed under the bed over every surface
3530023 the smaller the items were the more likely they were to have been stolen
3530024 the edinburgh festival makes disney world look like a non profit organisation
3530025 the first i knew about it was when all my other websites started closing down under the strain
3530026 initially it wasnt meant to be looked at by anyone a group of us were putting on an exhibition of the photos and the site was a place where we could look at the pictures while we talked on the phone
3530027 hed been doing it for about a month before he realised hed been taking about one picture a day and then he made a commitment to keep doing that
3530028 thats what he was like there are some people who have flashes of brilliance and do things in a huge rush or creative bursts but he was more of a steady keeps at it kind of guy and he did amazing stuff part of the appeal of the site is that jamie wasnt this amazing looking guy he led an incredible life but theres an everyman quality to the photographs
3530029 he was like no i took a picture of my lunch its already been taken
3530030 theres one woman who appears a lot in the earlier photographs who seems to have been a girlfriend but no one knows who she is
3530031 and when he was at the place he said unto them pray that ye enter not into temptation
3530032 and being in an agony he prayed more earnestly and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground
3530033 david has been very clear all along that the play is complete fiction unlike stuff happens and the permanent way it is not a documentary play it is fiction a theatrical and imaginative response to the governing class
3530034 absorbing politically and socially astute the hustler who nearly persuaded us to take him seriously as an important black leader
3530035 fascinating prints by artists including edward hopper depicting the us in the first half of the 20th century
3530036 tragedies when the media and public confuse association with causality and shun immunisation
3530037 the sheer repetition of the idea that the mmr vaccine might be linked to autism appeared to have influenced public understanding
3530038 i can do nothing it doesnt depend on what i do any more i dont think critics read my books
3530039 but i always go to the locations when i write a novel in this case some of the locations were so impressive that the idea for the film came from that
3530040 i enjoyed the preparation of the movie i mean the period immediately before the shooting when you choose everything all the details when you create the world i enjoyed a lot of the shooting too
3530041 bauchau has something in him that is to do with sincere spirituality
3530042 he gives the impression of someone who believes in something that is honest
3530043 few beings have ever been so impregnated pierced to the core by the conviction of the absolute futility of human aspiration
3530044 i tried but they are extremely boring i dont understand their success
3530045 the actors are good but that in my opinion was the only good thing technically it is not very good the script is not good
3530046 it is disgusting i dont like people talking about my private life
3530047 i am always looking for a compromise between a nice place and somewhere not too far from an airport
3530048 it needs personal discipline not to look at the internet
3530049 it is human temptation to read what is said about you but you have to resist
3530050 i think i will come back to writing for a while
3530051 mainly neglected fiction and non fiction by women for women and about women
3530052 we had the finest cookery in the world but it had been nearly lost by neglect
3530053 i suppose i thought of it as a jazz festival
3530054 or an arts festival or a drama festival it certainly wasnt the same market i worked in
3530055 but it just didnt come about my standup was done in all the traditional places the working mens clubs the rugby clubs not places like festivals its a completely different way of learning your career
3530056 its amazing to see what all these new comics are doing
3530057 my eyes are popping out of my head its incredible its absolutely inspiring
3530058 and we get people old enough to remember it first time round who perhaps want to remind themselves what it was like when we all had hair
3530059 ive had 35 years knocking around on the edge of the premiership perhaps not quite in it but im quite happy because im paying my bills so im not out to break any pots
3530060 i just have to do as good a job as i can edinburgh is like starting all over again ive had a fair whack of a career and the journeys not over yet to be given these opportunities i can only say a huge thank you then try and come up with the goods
3530061 ill take the experience of these three weeks away with me and ill analyse it to see do i want to push this further
3530062 in the first week i lost a stone in weight with worry
3530063 i was saying to myself what are you doing ive been a comic for 40 years and im risking throwing it all away by putting my head in this noose but now its just very very exciting its like a dream
3530064 i didnt realise quite how powerful the fringe was i was quite anxious before i got here whereas having settled in now mixed in with the nerves im just so chuffed and excited that i was lucky enough to be asked to be here
3530065 you never know you might think christ hes quite good this fella
3530066 because some of us older guys have been known to get the odd laugh you know even in the 21st century
3530067 the hayes family is comfortable with dr kraus recommendation to not conduct an autopsy
3530068 width of the nose and the length of the face
3530069 okay ive held off long enough what should we make of the two bits of the opening ceremony that werent
3530070 i am loath to get involved with the edwards business he always looked like a cad to me and i
3530071 such is the history of bad blood between virgin atlantic and british airways that this time sir richard branson has
3530072 this data allows investigators to identify suspects examine their contacts establish relationships between conspirators and place them in a specific location at a certain time
3530073 it also gives investigators the potential to identify other forensic opportunities identify witnesses and premises of evidential interest many alibis are proven or refuted through the use of communications data without the ec directive investigative opportunities will be increasingly lost
3530074 we will be told it is for use in combating terrorism and organised crime but if ripa powers are anything to go by it will soon be used to spy on ordinary peoples kids pets and bins
3530075 yet again the government have proved themselves unable to resist the temptation to take a power quite properly designed to combat terrorism to snoop on the lives of ordinary people in everyday circumstances
3530076 we set our price where we think it was fair given all considerations of the various issues
3530077 we do what we think is appropriate in order to have 47 000 affordable seats we had to have 4 500 expensive seats
3530078 we were trying to produce revenue that would support our expenses and our debt service but also balance that against the realities that tickets were going to be going up for our customers we were going to deliver qualitatively a far far higher product for them
3530079 after our first team meeting we felt like we had a true team of 25 guys all with the same goal in mind
3530080 the marketers of a line of dietary supplements have agreed to pay 2 5 million to settle federal trade commission charges that claims about their oregano oil and capsules were false and unsubstantiated in violation of federal law according to the ftcs complaint north american herb amp spice co llc and its owner judy kay gray falsely claimed that oreganol p73 super strength oreganol p73 and oregacyn currently sold as oregaresp are scientifically proven to prevent or treat colds and flu the defendants also claimed that the products boost the immune system and kill a variety of germs and pathogens including cold and flu viruses avian bird flu virus hepatitis c staphylococcus aureus helicobacter pylori mold parasites and yeasts sold at prices ranging from 29 99 to 69 99 the products purportedly contain p73 which is described as wild handpicked mediterranean oregano the products were advertised on web sites including www p 73 com and in magazines such as alternative medicine h2o health supplement retailer and womens health amp fitness the final order imposes a 2 5 million judgment and places restrictions on the defendants future conduct it prohibits them from claiming that their products prevent or treat colds or flu are clinically tested or scientifically proven to be effective or have other health or safety benefits unless the claims are true not misleading and based on reliable scientific evidence in addition the defendants are banned from misrepresenting the existence validity results or conclusions of any test or study the order also contains standard record keeping provisions to allow the ftc to monitor compliance
3530081 in three experiments the authors show that consumers who pay a discounted price for a product e g an energy drink thought to increase mental acuity may derive less actual benefit from consuming this product e g they are able to solve fewer puzzles than consumers who purchase and consume the exact same product but pay its regular price
3530082 the court also ruled that the claims were not supported even if some studies showed that the bracelets had a placebo effect noting that for a placebo to work
3530083 the advertiser must trick the customer into believing that an inherently ineffective bracelet actually relieves pain
3530084 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3530085 the tax system that allows this wholesale tax avoidance is an embarrassment and unfair to hardworking americans who pay their fair share of taxes we need to plug these tax loopholes and put these corporations back on the tax rolls
3530086 im committed to finding ways to improve compliance and reduce taxpayer burden so that we begin to bridge the tax gap which accounts for 345 billion in legally owed but uncollected federal revenues each year
3530087 shows yet again the need for full fledged tax reform next year
3530088 purge modernise and professionalise the municipal state and federal level police forces
3530089 our hope has always been that each new endeavour will expose new audiences to rocky horror and expand its fan base so here we go again with a new cast believing that the remake will add to the phenomenon
3530090 it is shocking that so few countries consider it important even to count the number of animals suffering in their laboratories
3530091 it is impossible to have a clear and honest debate about the role of animal experiments in the 21st century when the official number of animals involved is outrageously underestimated
3530092 this data allows investigators to identify suspects examine their contacts establish relationships between conspirators and place them in a specific location at a certain time
3530093 it also gives investigators the potential to identify other forensic opportunities identify witnesses and premises of evidential interest many alibis are proven or refuted through the use of communications data without the ec directive investigative opportunities will be increasingly lost

3530095 yet again the government have proved themselves unable to resist the temptation to take a power quite properly designed to combat terrorism to snoop on the lives of ordinary people in everyday circumstances
3530096 his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3530097 the right knows obama is unelectable except perhaps against attila the hun
3530098 regardless of the sex of the candidates most americans in essence see the president as the
3530099 this circular firing squad that is occurring is unattractive unprofessional unconscionable and unacceptable
3530100 i promise you today that ill remind them of everything they have done and one day we will win
3530101 we are a united nation everybody is supporting saakashvili he has defended our country
3530102 why did saakashvili take on russia with 10 000 soldiers maybe he was thinking somebody would help us but nobody did help us
3530103 units from the abkhaz military have completed an operation to push out the georgian army from the upper part of the kodori gorge
3530104 paid a high price for the progress that we have made
3530105 through a series of freak occurrences a group of actors shooting a big budget war movie are forced to become the soldiers they are portraying
3530106 it was even worse than the hateful stuff they used in promoting it
3530107 an r rated comedy that satirizes hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters in ridiculous situations
3530108 its never funny when good and decent human beings are humiliated
3530109 in fact it is dangerous and disgusting this film is all that and more
3530110 there is nothing negative about a name like coca cola or mcdonalds today in the 1970s maybe it was
3530111 we now have to see our country surrender to the enemy without demonstrating our power up to 120
3530112 history has shown time and time again that if you leave aggression to go unchecked you only store up graver problems for the future
3530113 for moscow the message from the bucharest compromise was that pressure works
3530114 the bomb came down suddenly our windows blew in everyones windows shattered people were screaming and dying others were hiding
3530115 i grabbed our bags and ran i saw gocha lying face down in the rubble
3530116 i dont know which side to blame i dont even know why this has happened
3530117 russia has been close to us for years it will defend us the us and europe wont
3530118 he was covered in blood there was no time to find out but he wasnt moving
3530119 we dont know if that would be as part of russia or as a separate united ossetian state
3530120 i would prefer there to be an independent and united ossetia but today it is not possible it is safer to be with russia the main aim of the struggle is to be independent of georgia
3530121 we became 18 because of soviet rule and russian before that
3530122 my grandfather was put on a train in 1937 with thousands of others and the next day a train arrived with georgian settlers no one returned from siberia
3530123 for russia abkhazia is just a card that can be played
3530124 abkhazia is linked to russia and russia is the only country that actually cooperates with abkhazia and today many are afraid this could lead to our political absorption
3530125 the threat of a disintegrating russia comparable to the break up of the soviet union in 1991 is still today seen as a very real threat by the kremlin and the russian elite
3530126 the west is seen today by many in the russian elite and public as a threatening force that is plotting to tear russia apart and rob it of its natural resources by supporting serbias right to veto kosovos secession the kremlin clearly believes that it is defending russias undisputed right to sustain its territorial integrity by any means available
3530127 if you are sick you visit the doctor he prescribes the medicine you take a spoonful three times a day and eventually you are better you are free however if you drank the whole bottle all at once it would kill you
3530128 it was really really frustrating to hear we would basically break even
3530129 there will be an end to it but it will take some time
3530130 i havent heard from her and thats not like her and chances are shes in armenia but we dont know and i dont like this not knowing
3530131 theyve bombed the airstrips and the cell phone towers and thats why i havent heard from her
3530132 the important thing is that she is safe and the rest of the people are safe too i feel terrible for our friends over there
3530133 or theyll probably make him pink and shoot flower coated puppies out of his anus as he travels the galaxy bringing happiness and free rainbows to everyone
3530134 crossing the divide of old politics to support barack obama for president
3530135 i have no doubt that his is the leadership we need and that the world is crying out for
3530136 its difficult to walk away from your partys nominee but you have to put your country first
3530137 there are a lot of democrats and independent voters who are going to vote for john mccain we know that for a fact america is desperate for leadership
3530138 when you pick up the newspapers and look at the maps there are red republican states and blue democratic states but we need a president who is red white and blue
3530139 she ran a very good campaign she inspired young women and people all over america and i want to give her credit for running such a fine campaign
3530140 apparently the culmination of 14 000 blow dryers created multiple vortices some reaching f1 status on the fujita scale the funnels caused thousands of dollars in damage and reeked of vidal sassoon
3530141 oh my god oh my god that was an awesome race just awesome
3530142 i am reassured after our talks that there will be more people going through the pavilions
3530143 were certainly the underdog in this election and i guess a lot of that has to do with the constant leadership instability that the party has displayed over the last four years
3530144 the public tend to want to punish political parties who behave in that way
3530145 ive spent my entire political career in opposition and i can tell you opposition is no fun
3530146 i come from the business community prior to politics where you could actually achieve things every day off the week whereas in opposition its very difficult to achieve anything
3530147 its not good enough just to do the minimum or meet minimum requirements of firing of a letter whilst youre telling all these staff that theyve lost their jobs
3530148 there are processes that can be undertaken to talk through what the issues are the reasons behind the decision and allow people the opportunity and maximise that opportunity for them to find alternative employment
3530149 a number of these workers have been with diners for a substantial period of time
3530150 there had been no notice that this decision was going to be taken and so i think its fair to say that many people were taken aback to the point of being quite upset
3530151 it was thought that the case management system needed review particularly at the caseloads which were being carried by case managers
3530152 it was also seen to be necessary to give clients better information about the services that they could contact in the case of crisis
3530153 i think its probably been a good thing overall because it has extended services for the seriously mentally ill to a larger proportion of the tasmanian population
3530154 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3530155 but this time the explosion came so abruptly i dont remember what happened afterward
3530156 our neighbor thinks it can fight us we are telling it no
3530157 we do not want to believe that the united states has given a green light to this adventurous act
3530158 but our american colleagues are telling us that theyre investigating now what may have happened in the channels of communication for mr saakashvili to have behaved in such a reckless manner
3530159 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3530160 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
3530161 is vulnerable to adversaries who seek information about our nations homeland defense programs classified or unclassified
3530162 any real or possible contacts with foreign intelligence services terrorists or foreign criminal enterprises
3530163 no i dont think so at all i really dont shes a terrifically conditioned athlete there might be on the outside she might look disappointed but she has her head up high right now and shes a tough tough kid the olympic format its not easy obviously every time shes been beaten its been by a great swim
3530164 dear kurma i was at the temple the other day and the samosas were amazing what goes into them to make them taste so amazing could it be the bhakti or love and all the ingredients
3530165 hello melissa yes you are right the ingredients have to be just right for any recipe to taste good

3530168 ela desembargadora tomou conhecimento por parte do ministro da pris o o ministro estava segundo a vers o dela realmente irado tomou para o pessoal o que n o foi ela disse isso para mim afirmou o juiz
3530169 houve liga o dela para mim querendo saber se eu tinha decretado a pris o preventiva eu disse que sim ela ficou um pouco perplexa minha decis o n o tem nada a ver com a do delegado prot genes queiroz tentei fazer um trabalho t cnico s isso
3530170 me causou surpresa tudo isto custo acreditar que isso seja realidade o coment rio feito pela corte superior ainda penso se caso de se tomar uma medida ou n o liga es de desembargadores para mim n o t m ocorrido cada advogado sabe como o juiz s vezes pode ligar para tirar d vidas mas n o mais que isso qualquer tentativa de influ ncia sobre a minha pessoa todo mundo sabe que um caminho furado

3530172 there is no hurry please take your time starting my wife went to the van to get reusable bags
3530173 the ineffable joy that can be had in pursuing the absurd
3530174 my head was so full of words that i often had trouble forming simple sentences out loud
3530175 and my speech became a curious jumble of obscure words and improper syntax
3530176 some days i feel as if i do not actually speak the english language
3530177 like trying to remember all the trees one sees through the window of a train
3530178 i find myself wondering why ive never seen this odd term that describes such a common article of clothing
3530179 sometimes i get angry at the dictionary and let loose with a muffled yell
3530180 the point at which i became bored has long since passed
3530181 human smoke the beginnings of world war ii the end of civilization
3530182 im not sure its really a review actually more of a summary than anything else
3530183 michael lenn of the monash university accident research centre said that while there was plenty of anecdotal evidence to suggest it could be dangerous there was no conclusive proof making it virtually impossible to legislate or educate against the practice
3530184 these guys are survivors yet here they are in our time when more than 40 percent of amphibians around the world are threatened
3530185 all these different factors are leading to their decline and its really really serious weve been finding dead frogs by the hundreds and thousands
3530186 if you ran into a problem where you really were concerned about something and wanted to do detailed scientific analysis these rules would make it much harder to do that
3530187 the endangered species act has evolved into something that is less concerned with helping species and more concerned with exerting economic control and holding up or sometimes stopping important economic activity
3530188 were very dependent on the same environment those animals are dependent on so like a canary going down into cave if the canary dies were next

3530190 it should not happen abruptly there should be of course a transition in which to pass from security re establishment to the development of the country and that the u n could do something else than only sending troops for security purposes
3530191 to get the rebel groups to disarm to get the rebel groups to leave the country if they dont belong in the country and for the internally displaced persons to go home
3530192 we are urging the fdlr to disarm respond to the demand of the security council and talk with president kabila so there could be a peaceful solution to this very dramatic problem of eastern congo
3530193 its not a question of people who are already overweight becoming clumsy because the majority of these children werent any heavier than their peers
3530194 it was assumed that all the neurological complications associated with obesity were consequences of obesity itself this suggests thats not the case
3530195 weve been following oil and gas development in the amazon since 2004 and the picture has changed before our eyes
3530196 when you look at where the oil and gas blocks are they overlap perfectly on top of the peak biodiversity spots almost as if by design and this is in one of the most if not the most biodiverse place on earth
3530197 the real concern is when exploration is successful and a zone moves into the development phase because thats when the roads drilling and pipelines come in
3530198 theyre not looking at the bigger picture of what happens if there are lots of projects going on at the same time
3530199 you could have each individual company thinking theyre being relatively responsible and keeping their own road networks under control and so on but what happens when you have 15 other projects around you all of a sudden when you look at the bigger picture you have a sprawling road network
3530200 the way that oil development is being pursued in the western amazon is a gross violation of the rights of the indigenous peoples of the region
3530201 international agreements and inter american human rights law recognise indigenous peoples have rights to their lands and explicitly prohibit the granting of concessions to exploit natural resources in their territories without their free prior and informed consent
3530202 there are raised eyebrows about the competition from the publicly funded lender
3530203 the majority of lending continues to be on conservative terms as lending criteria have tightened in response to the shortage of funding and current market conditions
3530204 these reductions will provide some relief for customers coming off fixed rate were seeing strong competition in the market and some easing in fixed rates and that adds up to a good result for customers
3530205 it is shocking that so few countries consider it important even to count the number of animals suffering in their laboratories
3530206 it is impossible to have a clear and honest debate about the role of animal experiments in the 21st century when the official number of animals involved is outrageously underestimated
3530207 its really quiet its a lot worse than the media realise
3530208 this time people can sit on property because interest rates are low
3530209 when things are allegedly easy you get a lot of johnny come latelys who think estate agency is an easy way to make money
3530210 we set our price where we think it was fair given all considerations of the various issues
3530211 we do what we think is appropriate in order to have 47 000 affordable seats we had to have 4 500 expensive seats
3530212 we were trying to produce revenue that would support our expenses and our debt service but also balance that against the realities that tickets were going to be going up for our customers we were going to deliver qualitatively a far far higher product for them
3530213 we considered that the department for environment food and rural affairs defra best practice guidance on environmental claims stated that green claims should not be vague or ambiguous for instance by simply trying to give a good impression about general concern for the environment claims should always avoid the vague use of terms such as sustainable green non polluting and so on
3530214 defra had made that recommendation because although sustainable was a widely used term the lack of a universally agreed definition meant that it was likely to be ambiguous and unclear to consumers because we had not seen data that showed how shell was effectively managing carbon emissions from its oil sands projects in order to limit climate change we concluded that the ad was misleading
3530215 their extraction cannot be described as a sustainable process and for shell to claim otherwise was wholly misleading
3530216 development which meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs
3530217 meant helping to meet the worlds growing energy needs in economic social and environmentally responsible ways and that in all their operations they integrated economic environmental and social considerations into their business decision making
3530218 the asas decision to uphold wwfs complaint sends a strong signal to business and industry that greenwash is unacceptable
3530219 if shell were serious about sourcing sustainable energy then they would be far better placed investing in renewable energy such as wind tidal or solar power
3530220 we stand firmly by our responsibility to support our authors and the free discussion of ideas even those that may be construed as offensive by some however a publisher must weigh that responsibility against others that it also bears and in this instance we decided after much deliberation to postpone publication for the safety of the author employees of random house inc booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the book
3530221 there does tend to be a full wallet at the start and students think it will last for ever
3530222 they come down to earth gradually or with a bump
3530223 we try to wean them off the perception that its just socialising through nightclubs and drink
3530224 we put things in place and offer them something different to try to lure them away from the abyss of 20 drinks a night takeaway pizzas and taxis home
3530225 the next day its so easy to just not bother cooking food to go out and have a pub lunch which obviously costs yet more money
3530226 were not trying to preach were just offering some tips about how to live cheaply
3530227 but theyre still quite hedonistic and not quite ready for that yet those that go to the talks tend to be better informed but its a case of reaching out to those that dont
3530228 i had a gap year to save up for university so i lived the life of riley throughout my first year
3530229 with the greater cost of tuition fees there is a lot more awareness of student finance but its still a real issue because during freshers week you can get carried away
3530230 from my perspective its important to make the new students aware
3530231 think about what youre spending your money on are you really going to get the most out of that society youre about to join do you really need a tv
3530232 you dont need to go out every night yes we promote our nights at the union but we dont put stuff on every night
3530233 its not expensive at all but its something to do during the day
3530234 they just have to turn up and get to know people
3530235 i know from my own experience how much money can really disappear during freshers week
3530236 so we try to package our advice in a fun and entertaining manner
3530237 as a student you basically get three pay days a year and that can make budgeting difficult
3530238 a large cheque comes into your account in september and it looks like a lot of money but remember theres no more coming until january
3530239 we would definitely recommend that a student pays their student loan into a savings account if they dont need to use it all immediately
3530240 look at the size of the overdraft the interest rates and also the charges how much are they and when they are taken
3530241 in planning your time think how well rather than just how much
3530242 university study is different to school placing higher demands on your organisational skills you will have to manage more information from more sources at greater speed using your own initiative
3530243 those universities that spent less than they estimated have reviewed their access agreements and expect there to be greater take up in future years
3530244 we think take up is an awareness problem and we are still in the early stages of a new system a national system would have few benefits
3530245 i think the system is fairly defective at the moment
3530246 the fact that millions are left unclaimed suggests the schemes are too complex and students find it difficult to find out what is available
3530247 some universities have completely lost sight of the fact that schemes should be about financing the poorest students they are offering scholarships to attract applicants to particular courses or they are attempting to boost their student entry qualification profile
3530248 textbooks for my course are very expensive so the bursary has really been very helpful
3530249 i have a part time job in the holidays but i dont have to rely on a job to keep me going
3530250 i find i am relatively well off but there are a lot of very well off students here some have parents who pay their tuition fees accommodation costs and all their other expenses
3530251 i am not from your typical cambridge background and it is a challenge in terms of work but i have made loads of friends
3530252 music helps such children to communicate the bursary did make quite a lot of difference because i was living off campus in cheltenham which is expensive
3530253 i fell into alcoholism whilst being totally wrapped up in my own little bubble
3530254 unfortunately i like many other young australians fell to the off field temptation of a so called party drug
3530255 the circumstances in which the supposed admissions were obtained amounted to an elaborate set up
3530256 we stand by our story lawrence dallaglio is damned in his own words and frankly we are amazed at his denial
3530257 it really was shitting on somebody elses doorstep and saying yes
3530258 i would never say to someone that they should take this index and decide upon their uni because you get different things at each institution
3530259 but we produce the figures because price is absolutely critical to your decision along with other factors such as the standard of education the style of teaching the quality of accommodation and the atmosphere all of which should go into the mix
3530260 its hard to explain it in any other way than that the older universities charge more for accommodation and have more expensive bars
3530261 this and similar surveys are aimed at full time undergraduate students
3530262 the information on the cost of living in the immediate vicinity of birkbeck is largely irrelevant to our students
3530263 because of the prices you have to pay for tuition going to university is a lot of money so particularly with the credit crunch costs are going to increasingly be a factor
3530264 a lot less of your money has to go on rent and shopping so you can go out and enjoy yourself a little bit more
3530265 the reason why people dont mind paying more in london is the facilities on offer yes cost of living is important but not as important as your education
3530266 should i break away from the cool crowd and get myself a job
3530267 serving your friends up drinks all night is not as great as it sounds they all want to be served first and they always want it for free i eventually got sick of serving up snakebite instead of drinking it
3530268 the managers would rota us down for loads of shifts and would be really unwilling to make changes
3530269 i used to feel completely obliged and my university work definitely suffered i had to work twice as hard in my final year to make up for it
3530270 im lucky in that i know i want to go into child psychology after uni
3530271 the job is great because its flexible i can increase or decrease my hours depending on my availability its also really rewarding and i know it will look good on my cv
3530272 barbarians look this is georgian democracy if it werent for russia we would already have been buried here
3530273 i saw a georgian soldier throw a grenade into a basement full of women and children
3530274 the young men ran but the women and the infirm who could not leave were shot like dogs
3530275 a growing world needs more energy but at the same time we need to find new ways of managing carbon emissions to limit climate change continued investment in technology is one of the key ways we are able to address this challenge and continue to secure a profitable and sustainable future
3530276 to unlock the potential of the vast canadian oil sands deposits
3530277 mr blaylock you are going to prison today for 90 days you were carrying a substantial amount of equipment during dark hours i feel i have no alternative you are a historic professional burglar
3530278 probably the worst any of us have seen for many years
3530279 when eyes meet across a crowded room looks obviously count first in determining who we find attractive but smell is an important sense for us we are animals after all smell kicks in more in maintaining a relationship it may not affect who you are attracted to in a crowded bar but it may determine how you feel about them next morning
3530280 the preferences of women who began using the contraceptive pill shifted towards men with genetically similar odours not only could mhc similarity in couples lead to infertility problems but it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the pill as odour perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction
3530281 i have only a few memories he left when i was five or six it is really a shock
3530282 he was trying to get into the acting business and he thought it was a more appropriate name
3530283 its going to be hard to prove anything because hes not left any permanent trail
3530284 i was suspicious from the first time i heard that he was related to the rockefeller family
3530285 the way he wore the name on his sleeve in a gloating kind of way seemed unusual
3530286 this defendants efforts to avoid identification are simply too extensive for us to take anything at face value one thing we are certain of this defendants true name is not clark rockefeller
3530287 come friendly bombs and fall on slough it isnt fit for humans now
3530288 if you want to know what slough was like in the 1970s go there now
3530289 i heard the wind wake everybody up so i went down to the campsite to check on the tents
3530290 everybody was fine but there was a dutch bloke whose tent had collapsed in the rain poor lad he went home this morning
3530291 at this time of year we should be chock full but look at it the motor homes and caravans are doing all right but bookings for tents are virtually non existent
3530292 when they tried to make their way back down the way they had gone up they were blocked by a river that was so badly swollen they could not get across if they had decided to try and get across the river it could have been nasty
3530293 i suppose i will have to get a new van
3530294 in the isle of wight and cornwall it was really wet
3530295 oh were used to it we have an electrical hook up it means we have light heat and a fresh bottle of milk in the morning which makes camping a lot more comfortable
3530296 we try to make things as simple as possible for the students
3530297 the first thing they should do is get their application in as early as they can because if they meet the deadlines well guarantee to get them their loan in the first few days of term its better not to be a tail ender
3530298 i think young people nowadays are quite savvy consumers who know how to scour the internet for the best deals from the banks
3530299 the most important thing is to see through the ones which give out useless gifts but dont offer great value elsewhere
3530300 working while youre a student is very much a part of life now
3530301 even students from oxford and cambridge who are encouraged not to get jobs in case it distracts them from their studies have started doing it its a good idea for students to work for their university because often theyll be better paid than those in the commercial sector and the staff will be more understanding when it comes to assessment time
3530302 wanted the journalist to know how it felt to have the tables turned after bullying the actors and trying to disrupt the play
3530303 they responded inappropriately when i tested their scenario i certainly wasnt bullying the actors
3530304 but we are a major football nation and we will actually have a match at hampden park which will be the only part of the 2012 olympics to take place in scotland
3530305 so i definitely think we should have a great british team picked from all our constituent countries
3530306 the evidence shows that your excessive consumption of alcohol was a contributing factor
3530307 you can check out anytime you like but you can never leave
3530308 staying on campus is expensive and i didnt want to move out because i didnt think i would study away from home half of the people i know have studied away have failed at uni because they partied too hard home life focuses you
3530309 living away from home you think you can do whatever you want
3530310 i had a friend lived on campus sometimes he wouldnt go lectures and seminars or he would turn his work in at the last minute eventually he failed and now he is considering taking another course and starting from scratch
3530311 the changes we have made enable an extra 100 000 students each year to benefit from some level of grant support while they are at university
3530312 together with loans available for tuition fees and living costs and bursaries that universities offer this improved package of support means nobody should be put off considering higher education for financial reasons
3530313 i wanted to move out but then i realised that there was no point
3530314 ive seen the rooms and i dont understand how they can charge me so much for a little box
3530315 when your rent is taken away you dont have anything to live on you find that student loan is going on rent rather than something more constructive
3530316 i cant speak for anyone who has gone to university close to home but i imagine that they do it because they feel more comfortable at home whereas i felt more comfortable moving away
3530317 if you ask me it benefits you more if you move away because you are stepping out of the box
3530318 moving away has given me more confidence some people feel that they cant leave home but i really appreciated having my own space
3530319 if there was any year that i would move out it would have been my first year
3530320 but i am not regretting my decision to stay at home at all
3530321 i spoke to a lot of students and i saw how it can get towards the end of term and how they cant afford to do an awful lot
3530322 conduct issues in good faith based on the facts available to them
3530323 i can be clear that it is not our policy to reduce the level of the award to a victim of rape due to alcohol consumption
3530324 this was a mistake in their interpretation of the guidelines
3530325 rebecca adlington is planning her next trip to the shoe shop
3530326 promise of designer shoes made britains golden girl kick up her heels to victory
3530327 40 of heterosexual british men say they would be justified in hitting their partner if she was unfaithful and 20 if they thought she was neglecting their children

3530334 a billion or more human beings were reportedly glued to their televisions around the world throughout the whole thing
3530335 it is vital the cica understands that women are not responsible for mens criminality because they have a drink or for any other reason
3530336 nobody would suggest that if someones wallet was stolen after having a drink then their compensation should be reduced
3530337 as far as we in the government are concerned a victim of rape is not in any way at all culpable due to alcohol consumption
3530338 as i understand it the cica have accepted that the guidelines were being misapplied i hope that the compensation authority will look at these other cases that they believe may also have had the guidelines misinterpreted and review them without the victims themselves having to go back and ask for that review
3530339 if an applicant accepts our decision then that case is finalised and closed
3530340 if they wish to ask for a review they must do this themselves in writing
3530341 contributed to the circumstances which gave rise to the injury
3530342 old prejudices like if a woman is wearing a short skirt or acting in a certain way are still operational
3530343 by reducing compensation because a woman has been drinking the cica is operating under those old prejudices
3530344 the scheme was originally applied wrongly in this case but this was corrected at review and the award was paid in full
3530345 it is not our policy to reduce the level of award to a victim of rape due to alcohol consumption this supports our view that a victim of rape is not in anyway culpable due to alcohol consumption
3530346 a victim of rape should not have any compensation reduced because of their drinking i hope that the compensation authority will look at these other cases
3530347 the production of bamboo would fall under our perennial crop standards so in theory we could certify the crop but the problem is the processing the process needed to break down the bamboo to make the fibres is very similar to that used to make viscose and weve yet to see a method that would come anywhere close to complying with our production standards people always say bamboo is great because it grows so quickly but so does cotton
3530348 wed be happy to certify bamboo at the soil association if someone could come up with a sustainable method that goes all through the supply chain not just the growing
3530349 mainly neglected fiction and non fiction by women for women and about women
3530350 we had the finest cookery in the world but it had been nearly lost by neglect
3530351 poor general health record compared to other parts of the country
3530352 we are looking for stores in deprived areas that do not currently sell fruit and veg and or stores in less deprived areas where there are limited places to buy fruit and veg
3530353 we are relying on the convenience store groups to identify stores that meet these criteria and well then check to make sure weve got a good mix across the region
3530354 the healthy stores initiative will not mean that shopkeepers will stop selling crisps sweets fizzy drinks and other unhealthy snacks they will just make room for and promote more fresh fruit and vegetables
3530355 obesity is the biggest health challenge we face it causes 9 000 people to die prematurely every year it costs the nhs 4 2bn and the economy 16bn per year
3530356 a government led movement that will help everyone change the way they live and live healthier lives
3530357 we know that families in some communities still use the corner shop on a daily basis for their food and other household goods it is therefore essential we take healthy eating options to these stores and reach those families who are at the greatest risk of poor health due to a poor diet
3530358 consumer habits are shifting people shop around at different outlets several times a week so its important that people have the opportunity to buy fresh fruit and vegetables where it is convenient for them
3530359 they try to support us they understand us they come and say that you know we are really sorry and we are your friends and we are we are
3530360 because we russians remember those days when we were quite friendly i vacationed almost every summer on the black sea in georgia theyre great people so friendly
3530361 i hope intelligent russians are against their government and i think most russian americans support the georgians the russian government will always be the same even if its name changes
3530362 we need the whole country to be saved and all georgians to be alive
3530363 we said people are dying we cant sing and dance here
3530364 it doesnt look as if this was premeditated until the night before the fighting russia seemed to be playing a constructive role
3530365 was forced to start this war by u s vice president dick cheney to support the campaign of john mccain the only possibility for john mccain to win is to have some kind of war
3530366 dont let your friends in washington democracy promoting institutes or neoconservative think tanks or who are important american newspaper columnists or television talking heads convince you that if you attack russia the united states and nato will rescue you
3530367 dont give guarantees or make threats you cannot carry out
3530368 russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgia territory
3530369 now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war

3530375 if the company is forced by regulators to bring these 3 billion in auction rate securities on its book we estimate it might have to write down roughly 350 million in auction rate securities losses
3530376 what is more significant is what long term rules the sec plans to propose
3530377 would force firms to spend money to automate their systems and would add costs to both brokers and customers in the form of increased borrowers fees
3530378 in this time of economic uncertainty that would not be a popular outcome for wall street
3530379 will continue exploring other remedies for the broader marketplace to further protect investors from distort and short artists
3530380 because the circumstances around the sec emergency order were so unusual im not sure we can gather any real lessons from trading activity during this period
3530381 i think theres curiosity about whether there will be any changes in trading but i havent heard any specific concerns
3530382 does not have a basis for determining that the 19 companies remain especially vulnerable to the illegal distort and short schemes that the emergency order prevented
3530383 it is a political document it is an agreement of principles and i think we have full coincidence of principles

3530393 there are people at 1oak theyre high end people but theyre sleeping till 2 oclock in the afternoon theyre drunk five nights a week you might go to 1oak and see 50 people and then what you have to get in a cab and go somewhere else if you look at the money that weve made and the money that 1oak has made in fewer risks that theyve taken because theyre so selective well they wanted to be so selective theyve had more problems with fights and stealing than weve had in two years its a lot more than binn does at 1oak who just lets people in and then theres a manager inside and then a floor manager i make much more of a hybrid decision
3530394 i have my differences with him but i cant deny the gentleman that hes a hard worker and thats why hes successful i cant deny that
3530395 i can look at someone like him whos been in this business forever and is just barely hanging on there are people who have been doing this for way too long and theyre burnt out and its obvious to everybody
3530396 theres someone i wont name but whos stuck around in the business way too long you can only be in this business if youre going to exit gracefully otherwise youre like the girl whos gone out too long who was cute at 22 but now she has the injections and the lifts and is mad i dont want to let her in anymore its one thing when youre 23 and youre tipsy and giggly its another when youre 43 and sloppy drunk its not a good look

3530431 we are talking about the apples and the pears if you have a pear shaped body your obesity is around your hips or so its a much lesser risk for heart attacks and strokes than when you are apple shaped that means fat is around the waist

3530498 some americans when they read this news may wonder where georgia is or why we should care about the conflict between georgians and the russian army its after all a small remote and obscure place but history is often made in remote obscure places and its being made in georgia today

3530503 the russian government stated it was acting only to protect ossetians and yet on saturday its bombing campaign encompassed the whole of georgia

3530602 its been truly amazing honestly going into last night i didnt really expect to catch bernard i gave it everything i had i was able to do that then to hang with those nba guys last night really topped it off

3530605 bach and malaythong the americans last chance to move on to the second round
3530606 bach really the big name on the u s team he describes himself as an ethnic chinese born in vietnam with a german sounding name holding a u s passport
3530607 not a great game out of the shoot for the u s a but they played well enough to win
3530608 it is a great experience for u s a badminton to move into the second round
3530609 so much for a tough test for serena on the court and off in a hurry
3530610 stosur has a lot of weapons and they werent shown at all in this match serena did not allow it dominating performance by serena
3530611 she is not playing that confidently yet shes just receiving so many errors that she has the lead
3530612 she has more scars on her than a professional wrestler that has been thrown out of the ring a bunch of times
3530613 the u s a will have to look to take a risk in the second half

3530616 i have been around a lot of captains in my time and i can say that kate barber is one of the finest leaders of people that we have ever had the privilege of coming across

3530618 what would be a surprise tonight would be if angola was even competitive
3530619 the united states knows that after tonight things are going to get tougher and they are going to have to continue to improve if they want to bring home the gold

3530622 this united states team is so unselfish they are always looking to make the extra pass
3530623 they want to work on their post defense as they are going to see dirk notwitzki and pau gasol in upcoming games
3530624 each game a guy provides a spark chris bosh and dwyane wade providing the spark in the last game against china paul doing that today
3530625 he told his team that their goal was to lose by less than 40 which is an unusual motivation tactic
3530626 with a game like this the united states is going to go into the locker room and they are going to challenge themselves because they know they have to be better
3530627 if these guys coached in the united states could you imagine the talk shows theyd be crushed
3530628 the sense of urgency has clicked in for spain all the loose balls are going their way

3530646 strangely to get rid of the cinderella element i ended up making nearly all of the changes to the hero rather than the heroine the end result was a much more believable story which garnered a lot of positive reader feedback
3530647 i couldnt figure out how to change one part of the story without impacting everything else that came before or after
3530648 you dont always have to do what an editor suggests but you do have to deal with her concern
3530649 i had become too married to my story passionate adoration of every word that i had lovingly opened a vein over did not make for objectivity i could no longer see the possibilities of changing it it was just too much work for my exhausted soul
3530650 my first instinct was to say no but i asked for a few days to think about it and im glad i did i wanted an agent if i had thought her suggestions would make the book worse i wouldnt have agreed to change it
3530651 the most important lesson ive learned about revision is to believe anything can be fixed im absolutely certain any action can be motivated as long as the writer is willing to slash out parts that dont work and start from scratch

3530656 if you pose this question to my casteist political adversaries they will have no answer to this because they cannot see a dalits daughter rising to such heights
3530657 these parties felt most threatened when my name was proposed for prime ministership during the course of the upa governments trust vote in parliament so both the nda and upa decided to gang up and save the central government
3530658 well i should express my gratitude to these very parties as the profile enhancement that the bsp witnessed over a span of just six or seven days was something we would have otherwise taken six or seven years to achieve
3530659 realising that the rise of the bsp was a direct threat to them the congress led upa was looking for new ways and means to run me down and the latest in the series was implicating me in the disproportionate assets case that has been speeded up particularly after i refused to support them during the trust vote
3530660 my supporters are aware that all the wealth and property i have acquired actually consists of the gifts i have received on my birthdays and nearly rs300m out of that has been given away as income tax yet the government is trying to harass me by cooking up false cases
3530661 i am sure my supporters are not going to get affected by such falsehood and campaigns launched by my adversaries
3530662 while the bjp began to hound me by fabricating cases in the name of the taj corridor the congress left no stone unturned in attempting to tarnish my image by letting loose the cbi to concoct cases against me

3530665 i think the players the frame of mind they are in is better
3530666 this has been a great place and if were going to come back i would be more than happy
3530667 were looking forward to going to denver we had great work with them last year
3530668 that opportunity again to go against another team during training camp i think it is going to be a really good experience for us
3530669 if we dont make it this year im not going to explode
3530670 injuries are a part of the game and in 35 years since weve owned the yankees ive never seen a rash of injuries like this
3530671 considering the injuries and what hes done with the bullpen without joba it speaks volumes to what hes capable of doing and how smart he is at some point theres nothing you can do
3530672 chamberlain had become the most dominant starting pitcher in baseball and wang has been a 19 game winner every year
3530673 you lose those two guys its rough if the red sox lost josh beckett and jon lester the whole national media would be crying about it we lose two guys better than beckett and lester and you dont hear anything
3530674 what can we do our leader ajit singh had extended an opportunity to mayawati to change the socio political fabric of uttar pradesh but it seems she is not interested
3530675 earlier congress and sp were wooing us but now we need them
3530676 it is for the congress leadership that is sonia gandhi to decide what kind of an arrangement can be worked out
3530677 as soon as you learn to avoid evil thoughts you will learn to avoid evil deeds

3530682 molly thank you for all the wonderful breaks i can take from running my own business when i read your authentic promotion ezine so full of great pragmatic advice and thoughts just what i need and so uplifting
3530683 we are strongly opposed to interference in chinas internal affairs in the name of human rights

3530685 sam sparro meets london glam via parisian fashionista jean charles de castelbajac its sharp but definitely not too serious

3530687 ah kita tidak mungkin bisa mendapatkan pemimpin yang ideal bahkan super ideal seperti rasulullah apalagi sekarang kita kan bukan rasul
3530688 we had been trying to report on it for some time basically treating the national enquirer story as if it were a tip
3530689 our reaction to it is to ask whether or not it is true
3530690 que poder ser adaptado realidade nacional e seria interessante como iniciativa da
3530691 im joining a big club in the premier league this is the best league in the world and last year villa did very well
3530692 my ambition is to play for my country and i think with aston villa i will have that possibility
3530693 for years fema resisted acknowledging the problem or seeking funds for remediation
3530694 we are committed to upholding our obligations to remediate remove or upgrade them as necessary
3530695 we believe in adhering to any relevant environmental rule or law and will do so
3530696 all the clubs file their gate returns which get logged and dynamic research is constantly carried out a premier league spokesman said yesterday
3530697 clearly pricing is a matter for the individual clubs but we encourage them to offer a broad range of tickets
3530698 manchester united arsenal and chelsea have unrequited demand while wigan blackburn rovers and to an extent middlesbrough are in areas where they have to work very hard to get people through the turnstiles because of economic issues clubs do offer cheap and imaginative ticketing policy
3530699 for the last couple of seasons ive gone into it as if its my last
3530700 the coaching course brought me back down to earth after moscow
3530701 i enjoyed it although its hard work looking at things from the other side of the fence it was tough being used to playing and just concentrating on that
3530702 there are so many other things to concentrate on as a coach so i suppose i appreciate what the coach is doing a lot more now i think i will pursue it i have to finish it off this season and then go for my pro licence
3530703 i have good players around me and want to experience things like we did last season winning trophies is what motivates me
3530704 the teams around us have brought players in and thats the challenge
3530705 there are some good teams and we dont want to be catching them up ideally were a little bit light in attack at the moment and its a bit similar to last season i think cristiano was suspended for a few games and wayne broke his foot
3530706 i think it is possible to improve on last year thats the challenge no english club has ever defended the champions league so it would be brilliant to do that
3530707 he had a great season but thats gone now and hell be looking ahead to the new one
3530708 keep my bond money keep everything weve just got to get out of here
3530709 terrorising young children in the street so their screams could be heard
3530710 i think these people are getting off on hearing our children scream
3530711 we are not complaining about the way police are handling this matter
3530712 it amazes me how fast police get here soon after i have called for help
3530713 they patrol here regularly and they always do their best
3530714 but these kids have not been caught and the situation is terrible for us now
3530715 i have seen fear in my kids eyes that i will never forget
3530716 living here scares the heck out of us all now
3530717 the worst times are on fridays and saturdays we dread approaching weekends
3530718 but the sad part is i would never leave my present home if only we felt safe
3530719 we always treat all complaints very seriously but from our figures that particular area of bruce street is not a high crime area
3530720 of course public fear is a concern for us but certainly our figures dont show a lot of crime there
3530721 we have reactive police who respond to calls and pro active taskings to address area of high crime or concern
3530722 we have finite resources and we cannot be everywhere at once
3530723 but if there is a specific problem we will always look at it
3530724 the three of us suddenly had to deal with this loss
3530725 i lost my husband i lost my best friend and they lost their father
3530726 we all have a different loss and a different way of coping
3530727 we spent most of our time together we made all our decisions together
3530728 just before christmas he started to get pains but he was adamant we still go away on holiday
3530729 it was like the harder he fought the harder the cancer fought
3530730 but we were still really hopeful youve always got that bit of hope and you just cling to it
3530731 he always said he wanted to die at home and it was so special to have him here
3530732 he never complained about his illness he would just say he was sorry for what we were going through
3530733 he was always there for everyone else not thinking of himself
3530734 he loved to take the kids out on the boat
3530735 he was always telling people to slow down and enjoy life
3530736 he could never say no to anyone someone would ring for a charity donation and he would have to say yes
3530737 it will be a chance for his kids to see how much he was respected by the community
3530738 i dont know how to express my thanks for what they are doing for us
3530739 it shows the impact he had on other people and how much he meant to them
3530740 the project at green hills is part of the super saturday protest where we are trying to raise the awareness of people about this issue
3530741 our main purpose is to try to get people to contact their local politicians and the leaders of the liberal and national parties over this matter
3530742 the centre at green hills is a local campaign when we will be talking to the community asking people to write to their local mps
3530743 it is the first time we will hold the event so it should be really good
3530744 we regard this election on september 13 as a referendum of sorts on the state government
3530745 we think a lot of people in the lower hunter think the area has been neglected and they will vote accordingly
3530746 we know premier iemma has asked his ministers to come here because there is such a backlash in the hunter region and central coast
3530747 by voting hunter liberal voters will be sending a strong message to the government
3530748 we should be getting 1 in every 8 and that is far less than what is spent in the hunter region and the central coast
3530749 thats the ultimate test and you can see it the neglect is evident in the roads in the railways in public buildings and now were seeing it in land releases
3530750 instead of coming up with alternative ideas proposals or policies they criticise public servants such as our police and teachers and point the finger at the state government
3530751 if you look at maitland and the infrastructure that has been put in place here going back to when john price was in office and in the past 12 months youll see were getting a new bridge across the hunter river were getting a bigger emergency department for maitland hospital and new trains are on the way
3530752 declared their hands and theyre trying every trick in the book to get elected
3530753 the productivity commission inquiry into paid paternity and maternity leave new child protection policies the review of antenatal education and the proposed childrens centres all have fathers as key players
3530754 yet in many of those areas we either lack australian research or we have research in a variety of areas with no overview to make it useful to policy development
3530755 the australian fatherhood research network will provide independent evidence based advice on the role of fathers in the context of the important family policy issues being addressed by government
3530756 we need to define clearly the notion of fatherhood and understand its relationship and differences to motherhood
3530757 we also have big gaps in our knowledge of indigenous fathering and how cultural factors influence father child relationships
3530758 even basic survey questions on parenting used by the australian bureau of statistics need to be reviewed because they are based on the mothers role and are assumed to be appropriate for fathers
3530759 if you keep doing what youve always done you will keep getting what you always got
3530760 bitch i really want to smack the sh t out of you but i am not trying to go to jail

3530763 thats what i do to take a person from a state of pain and dysfunction to optimal health and function
3530764 it is not chiropractic medicine versus orthopedic medicine thats irrelevant whats important is that you get well
3530765 what conventional medicine can do in six months we can do in three weeks
3530766 what we did with cecil mamiit and the other national athletes was done in a hurry considering that they were in the midst of matches of competitions
3530767 imagine what we can do to you given longer healing sessions
3530768 of course weve gone through all of the material in the collection but there is quite a bit that hasnt been seen by the public since it was released at l a s park theatre
3530769 other parts of the collection havent been seen by anyone outside of the company we are taking these gems and remastering them to bring out the richness of color and fullness of the old style sync sound

3530771 from frances goudon where his focus is on 20 something models t uber said
3530772 in the midst of staged styled shoots goudon also shows everyday scenes of guys dressed in only a towel enjoying the vista of saint tropez or a cheerful scene of two friends laughing
3530773 this is where the men are the muscles of these models shine with sweat and their chests are furry

3530780 there is an idea of a patrick bateman some kind of abstraction but there is no real me only an entity something illusory and though i can hide my cold gaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping you and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable i simply am not there
3530781 i have all the characteristics of a human being flesh blood skin hair but not a single clear identifiable emotion except for greed and disgust something horrible is happening inside of me and i dont know why my nightly bloodlust has overflown into my days i feel lethal on the verge of frenzy i think my mask of sanity is about to slip
3530782 everything failed to subdue me soon everything seemed dull another sunrise the lives of heroes falling in love war the discoveries people made about each other the only thing that didnt bore me obviously enough was how much money tim price made and yet in its obviousness it did there wasnt a clear identifiable emotion within me except for greed and possibly total disgust i had all the characteristics of a human being flesh blood skin hair but my depersonalization was so intense had gone so deep that the normal ability to feel compassion had been eradicated the victim of a slow purposeful erasure i was simply imitating reality a rough resemblance of a human being with only a dim corner of my mind functioning something horrible was happening and yet i couldnt figure out why i couldnt put my finger on it
3530783 harold its bateman patrick bateman youre my lawyer so i think you should know ive killed a lot of people some girls in the apartment uptown uh some homeless people maybe 5 or 10 um an nyu girl i met in central park i left her in a parking lot behind some donut shop i killed bethany my old girlfriend with a nail gun and some man uh some old faggot with a dog last week i killed another girl with a chainsaw i had to she almost got away and uh someone else there i cant remember maybe a model but shes dead too and paul allen paul owen in the book i killed paul allen with an axe in the face his body is dissolving in a bathtub in hells kitchen i dont want to leave anything out here i guess ive killed maybe 20 people maybe 40 i have tapes of a lot of it uh some of the girls have seen the tapes i even um i ate some of their brains and i tried to cook a little tonight i uh i just had to kill a lot of people and im not sure im gonna get away with it this time i guess ill uh i mean ah i guess im a pretty uh i mean i guess im a pretty sick guy so if you get back tomorrow meet me at harrys bar so you know keep your eyes open

3530795 i dont get too many fans asking for my autograph
3530796 so i was a little surprised when i walked into the parking lot and this kid handed me a jersey and asked if i would sign it
3530797 i have been taking practice autograph requests for about four years now maybe longer im not sure i cant remember exactly when i started
3530798 but its nothing like taking a real autograph request everything just moves so much faster once its for real i found myself holding the pen and feeling like id never signed my name before
3530799 history has shown time and time again that if you leave violence to go unchecked it leads to more problems
3530800 whatever actions are taken will be at the international level and not bilateral
3530801 this is the first war that the united states has fought where so many of the people and resources involved arent of the military but from contractors
3530802 it was considered an all out imperative by the administration to keep troop levels low particularly in the beginning of the war and one way that was done was to shift money and manpower to contractors but that has exposed the military to greater risks from contractor waste and abuse
3530803 it is a shocking number but i still dont think it is the full cost
3530804 i dont think there have been any credible cost numbers for the iraq war there was so much money spent at the beginning of the war and nobody knows where it went
3530805 these new numbers point to the overall question when do you cross the line in terms of turning over too much of the public mission of defense to private firms
3530806 there are some things that are appropriate for private companies to do but others things that are not but we dont seem to have had a strategy for determining which was appropriate and which wasnt we have just handed over functions to contractors in a very haphazard way
3530807 the truman committee held 60 hearings on waste fraud and abuse
3530808 its unfathomable to me that we dont have a bipartisan investigative committee on contracting in iraq
3530809 now i want you to keep this one pinned to you at all times at gas stations
3530810 you wont think its ridiculous when youre locked out of your car at a gas station in the middle of nowhere youll be thanking me that you have that key pinned to your pants
3530811 pull up your shirt i want to tape this last key to your stomach you know just in case
3530812 just in case just in case what just in case i lose the key in my pocket in my purse the key pinned to my pants and the original key on my keychain this is getting out of hand you are not taping a key to my stomach
3530813 as a consequence of poor results its the right decision
3530814 im just disappointed because i feel i have a lot to offer
3530815 no doubt some people will claim that these proposals are unworkable unreasonable and perhaps plain barmy
3530816 but the issue is clear internal migration has always been an important part of a dynamic economy
3530817 if we are to ensure that people in this country have similar opportunities regardless of where they are born we need to allow people to move from places with few prospects to places that offer more opportunities
3530818 all towns and cities should have the right to determine their own policies and their local councils should be assessed regularly and accurately and the results of such assessment explained to local people
3530819 yang peiyi missed out on selection because of her external appearance it was for the national interest

3530851 negeri yang kami lalui untuk diintai itu adalah luar biasa baiknya 14 8 jika tuhan berkenan kepada kita maka ia akan membawa kita masuk ke negeri itu dan akan memberikannya kepada kita suatu negeri yang berlimpah limpah susu dan madunya 14 9 hanya janganlah memberontak kepada tuhan dan janganlah takut kepada bangsa negeri itu sebab mereka akan kita telan habis yang melindungi mereka sudah meninggalkan mereka sedang tuhan menyertai kita janganlah takut kepada mereka

3530867 that opportunity again to go against another team during training camp i think it is going to be a really good experience for us
3530868 we told the georgians that their desire to join nato will not help solve the problems of abkhazia and south ossetia it will lead to renewed bloodshed
3530869 russia has practically ceased to recognize georgias territorial integrity and internationally recognized borders and is using force to underscore this fact international organizations are as usual behind the curve in taking note of this development and drawing the conclusions from it
3530870 moscow is very interested in stopping georgia developing as a pro west state and blocking its bid to join nato the west must be equally determined to help tbilisi follow its chosen course
3530871 heavily armed proxy troops opened fire on georgian villages while the secessionist authorities refused to talk with tbilisi
3530872 the attacking forces began destroying the transmission antennae of georgian mobile telephone systems arms and paramilitary groups poured in from russia to south ossetia through the russian controlled roki tunnel russian officials in georgia claimed that the attacking forces were out of russias control officials in moscow meanwhile justified the attacks directly and indirectly by accusing georgia of aggression
3530873 the russian government must respect georgias territorial integrity and sovereignty
3530874 but you and we should say what we really think and aim only at what is possible for we both alike know that in the discussion of human affairs the question of justice only enters where there is equal power to enforce it and that the powerful exact what they can and the weak grant what they must

3530883 the more were able to help them do that on their own while were here the more were able to help them and observe them is going to be a help for them in the future but its very important that they start taking on the role themselves

3530891 el gobierno de cuba mantiene en su enorme sistema carcelario la mayor cantidad a escala planetaria en cifras absolutas de prisioneros de conciencia adoptados por amnist a internacional
3530892 ya no se basa en largas condenas de prisi n como ocurr a en a os recientes lo m s frecuente es que ocurran detenciones de corta duraci n amenazas interrogatorios por parte de los aparatos policiales
3530893 si bien el n mero de prisioneros pol ticos no tiende a aumentar es visible que el gobierno contin a aplicando cada vez m s ampliamente la variante de sustituir la represi n pol tica basada en largas condenas de c rcel por procedimientos de bajo perfil
3530894 la situaci n sigue siendo muy desfavorable debido a que contin a prevaleciendo el monopolio casi absoluto del estado en todos los sectores y ramas de la econom a exceptuando ciertos islotes de propiedad privada
3530895 la falta de suficiente informaci n p blica en cuanto al n mero de conmutaciones y cu ntas fueron por 30 a os de prisi n o cadena perpetua
3530896 las penas de muerte conmutadas fueron entre veinte y treinta y alrededor de la mitad lo fueron por cadena perpetua
3530897 todos los presos beneficiados con la conmutaci n permanecen internados en los corredores de la muerte

3530971 the american cultural imperative that pressures women to look young and men to need to sleep with those women is oppressive to all involved

3530975 the american cultural imperative that pressures women to look young and men to need to sleep with those women is oppressive to all involved
3530976 the feminist movement while essentially progressive and sexually liberating has also often emphasized the victim nature of womanhood and served to strengthen a double standard that in this case demonizes masculinity in general and powerful men in particular

3530978 we were on a love boat and your ass got jettisoned

3530980 we know that it was a disgruntled fan of the series who hacked our system it took place as a direct result of the lexicons backing of stephenie meyer and her work
3530981 if you were posting on every thread on our forums stephenie meyer is a terrible writer everything about it is horrible then we just arent the place for you
3530982 as her official fan site this needs to be a positive place where we can gather together and discuss what we like and have positive conversation hate spam makes it very difficult for someone to enjoy the site
3530983 if you hit the site with enough traffic its security measures begin to fall the message board had been spammed and it allowed a hole in the security net that somebody was able to get through and delete forums
3530984 because of the spamming there were so many ip addresses there is no shortage of suspects and no way to know which one exactly did the attack
3530985 the hole that enabled them to get into the blog has been sealed as far as contacting law enforcement we have been in contact with our server company and there are definite measures being taken to ensure that this doesnt happen again
3530986 its a very difficult time for the fandom in that you liked it or you really hated it everyone feels like they need to get their say but that means that the fans that really liked it need to have their site too the blog is that place for these ladies and a few men who have been worshipping this book for years

3531046 among adults with vision problems a public health gap exists in actual access to eye care services between canada and the united states primarily owing to the population without health insurance in the united states
3531047 the difference in use of eye care services between americans without health insurance and canadians narrowed when adjusted for income level and was almost eliminated when adjusted for having optional vision insurance
3531048 therefore public health interventions targeting adults with vision problems without health insurance might be more beneficial if they focused on those at risk for serious vision loss especially those in the lowest income group
3531049 weve found that having regular doctors who although they dont live in nunavut come back to work on a regular basis has brought some of the advantages of full time doctors and avoided some of the disadvantages of doctors that dont know anything about the place
3531050 the main challenge to having doctors stay here has been the workloads
3531051 thats exacerbated when were short staffed because the work all falls on the shoulders of the people that are left and then youd drive them out because theyre exhausted and then youre even shorter staffed and so the workloads increase so it becomes a vicious circle
3531052 you have to have quite general skills and youve got to have the confidence to use them without constantly having backup
3531053 so its a challenge and quite satisfying when things go well

3531084 what if a better film exists that i havent yet seen what if five years from now a better film is released surely if this happens the integrity of the rating system will be diminished if i rate a 10 now

3531179 as you probably know i have been pretty quiet about the whereabouts of the band and the future and id like to inform you that we are on indefinite hiatus for now i feel that it is too early to continue or try to continue without vitek and or covan at this particular moment regarding covan hes recovering now and needs all the time in the world to comeback to a normal life so i want to wait for him so we could both decide what the future will hold for i definitely want to keep on playing and touring as its very important for me to keep on playing music while we have this break with id like to mention that im open to explore options regarding joining or touring as a session player given the seriousness of the project i could work on dedicating as much time as possible to it i also want to express my respect for everyone who has supported the families of vitek and covan on any kind of way since the accident
3531180 he knew how to treat people and treated them really nice
3531181 he would wave his hand at everybody we would pass
3531182 he could fight like a bear he wasnt scared of nobody
3531183 he confronted two of the black panthers and said i heard you wanted to eliminate me he never backed down from anyone somerville said
3531184 if you got arrested by him you deserved to be arrested he gave everybody a break

3531189 cape fears operating performance lags the industry averages with respect to a number of metrics including returns efficiency and profitability in addition the companys stock has underperformed its peers for an extended period and its shares are currently at a five year low
3531190 the company has generally trailed the peer group median in terms of operational performance since 2004
3531191 deterioration in the companys loan portfolio and the allowances for loan losses which currently represent just over one half of nonperforming assets
3531192 we believe such material weaknesses may signal weak internal accounting expertise poor internal controls and aggressive financial reporting practices at the company
3531193 in this case we believe that the chairman of the audit committee has not satisfactorily performed his duties in this regard
3531194 we note that the audit committee has not appointed an audit committee financial expert as defined by the sec an audit financial expert is essential in providing the committee with expert advice and guidance as it relates to the oversight of the companys accounting and financial reporting we believe this is a serious omission for which the chair of the audit committee should be held accountable
3531195 we believe that shareholders should be concerned regarding the boards timing of a potential sale in december 2007 the board determined to not hold discussions with mr koury regarding an offer to acquire the company for 12 00 per share however it now believes a strategic transaction could be best for shareholders at the current depressed values
3531196 w e question why the board did not consult with its financial advisor prior to rejecting mr kourys december 2007 offer if only to gauge the attractiveness of such offer in a softening economy as well as to decide whether the time was right to seek out interested parties
3531197 a comparative analysis of the dissident and management slates indicates that the dissident has more relevant financial and banking experience
3531198 is a manager at cameron management llc an investment firm focused on real estate and other financial investments and previously served on wachovia banks local advisory board
3531199 unless one of the following two things has occurred i there are serious problems at the company and the newly proposed nominee has a clear and realistic plan to solve those problems or ii the current board has undertaken an action clearly contrary to the interests of shareholders or failed to undertake an action clearly to the benefit of shareholders
3531200 the participation of new directors will likely be of value in the boards strategic review process and independent directors with substantial industry experience could assist management in crafting such a turn around of the bank
3531201 we were surprised obviously we had a unanimous decision at the court of appeals we had guilty verdicts at the trial court level

3531214 vaak wordt nieuw beleid meteen op alle scholen tegelijk ingevoerd
3531215 wat je zou willen is dat je eerst door middel van experimenten uitzoekt of dat nieuwe beleid ook echt zal werken
3531216 maar er is nauwelijks onderzoek waaruit blijkt dat dit zo is ik zou zeggen voer die maatschappelijke stage niet meteen op alle scholen in maar doe eerst onderzoek dat kost een paar jaar ja maar dan heb je wel de zekerheid dat het werkt
3531217 gratis schoolboeken ook zoiets wat weten we daar nu van veel te weinig welke gevolgen heeft die maatregel voor de uitgeversbranche bijvoorbeeld wat gebeurt er met de boekenmarkt ik zou zeggen wacht nou even in plaats van snel te scoren met iets waarvan je de gevolgen niet hebt onderzocht
3531218 er zijn nu eenmaal zaken die bij wijze van spreken morgen al moeten gebeuren maar voor maatschappelijke stages en gratis schoolboeken gold dat niet daar was echt geen haast bij
3531219 bewindslieden kijken meestal niet verder vooruit dan vier jaar schandelijk eigenlijk want daardoor heerst te vaak de waan van de dag
3531220 in de gezondheidszorg worden ook experimenten met twee groepen gedaan en daar gaat het om leven en dood

3531222 zijn werk was zijn leven hij voelde zich voor geen enkele klus te beroerd
3531223 tijdens mijn meest recente bezoek aan afghanistan in mei heb ik uitgebreid met storimans gesproken ik heb hem leren kennen als een hardwerkende professional en een bijzonder sympathieke man
3531224 we kwamen elkaar vaak tegen hij deed alles voor rtl ook royalty verhalen en huwelijken hij was op een nette manier brutaal liet zich niet tegenhouden als er iets gebeurde was hij er al naar toe zoals de tsunami bijvoorbeeld
3531225 we werden gearresteerd hij werd niet kwaad dit was het risico
3531226 ik heb hem meteen gebeld en kreeg een buitenlands bandje aan de lijn gelukkig hij heeft zijn toestel nog aan dacht ik een kwartier later kreeg ik de voicemail
3531227 omdat niemand zal geloven dat j j het hebt gedaan
3531228 als alles op zn plaats valt het ondefinieerbare en onmisbare contact met het publiek ontstaat dan gaat het als vanzelf
3531229 met voordrachten sta je er anders dan bij acteren als jezelf
3531230 dat is erg wennen als je altijd dragende rollen hebt gehad
3531231 ik ben in de eerste plaats een romanticus ik huil om gelukkige en droevige eindes bij films en liedjes
3531232 het is mood music sfeermuziek en als je een bepaalde stemming oproept bereik je vanzelf een hoop mensen

3531234 soul man en zijn uitvoering van walk on by blijven me altijd bij
3531235 twee nhalve minuut de tijd die voor een nummer stond waren niet genoeg voor mij
3531236 wat ik wilde zeggen kon onmogelijk binnen drie minuten worden uitgedrukt
3531237 ze hebben aan elkaar doorgegeven dat hier iets lekkers te eten is
3531238 ik heb wel het gevoel dat ik iets moois heb gedaan maar tegelijkertijd heb ik een beetje het gevoel dat het helemaal mislukt is
3531239 je weet van tevoren dat je op de k2 een hele hele hele grote kans maakt om niet meer terug te komen
3531240 dat is een fantastisch gevoel maar het had zo lang geduurd dat we lang getwijfeld hebben of het ook zou lukken rationeel gezien hadden we misschien moeten besluiten om om te keren
3531241 maar we hebben er jarenlang voor getraind en op een gegeven moment wil je ook doordouwen
3531242 als je dan uiteindelijk op de top staat dat is zon verschrikkelijk fantastisch moment
3531243 het is verschrikkelijk tragisch dat het op de terugweg dan fout gaat
3531244 hij zei niets hij riep niets hij kwam gewoon plotseling voorbij schuiven
3531245 het is heel erg steil het is een soort sneeuwhelling dus je ziet ze ook niet voetsporen waren ook niet meer te zien
3531246 het sneeuwde en ik zag niets ik wist niet eens meer aan welke kant van de berg ik zat op een gegeven moment was het zo steil dat ik alleen nog maar naar links of naar rechts kon ik dacht een helikopter kan op deze hoogte niet komen niemand weet waar ik zit ik zal het echt zelf moeten doen ik heb een tijdje liggen dommelen en toen brak de bewolking een beetje open daardoor kon ik in de diepte kijken en vond ik een ontsnappingsroute
3531247 het duurt dagen misschien wel weken voordat je weet hoe die hele puzzel in elkaar zit je moet ook gewoon veel verhalen van andere lui horen
3531248 als ik dat niet meer doe ben ik mezelf niet meer dat is iets wat in ons zit het is een passie we zouden niet zonder kunnen
3531249 i think its fair to say i expect capital spending to be up year over year in 2009
3531250 as you know the last time i said that i really felt our third quarter was the bottom of the trough and that we would see a modest recovery i am sticking to that at this time
3531251 thats one of the key differences of these new commercial notebooks
3531252 this is dramatically different for dell theyre responding more to what the end user is saying in addition to what the it manager wants
3531253 i fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve
3531254 my experiences fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe you can do whatever you want
3531255 there is a euphoria attached to the relentless feeding of the ego
3531256 the grandiosity in their own mind tends to make them so vain that an illusion of invincibility is created
3531257 narcissism creates an over amplification of who someone thinks they are and it creates self deception
3531258 they are insensitive to the reality of events and relationships around them until they fall off the skyscraper and find that the law of gravity applies to them too

3531262 thats why our goal is to get it back abbott said
3531263 then maybe some girls will get a chance to relive in 2016 what were living right now said abbott
3531264 it should be pretty easy for video game developers to integrate our research into new games as a game developer myself i know first hand that stretched out and flickering backgrounds and details are no longer acceptable in 3d video games
3531265 people are looking for ways to get rid of these distortions preferably without having to pay artists to generate background and detail images by hand we have come up with a way to do this and we are planning to provide code for download soon
3531266 the existing methods for using computer generated noise to make images for backgrounds and details for 3d video games are fast but the images that you get dont look very good our work gives you the full computational benefit of noise but without many of the tradeoffs such as distortion and flickering
3531267 the graphics generated from the procedural approach that we explored in this project are very small illustrating video games with small images is going to be increasingly important in the future as more and more games are downloadable
3531268 getting a paper into siggraph is an accomplishment for any senior researcher in computer graphics presenting a paper in siggraph based on work done as an undergraduate is astonishing were very proud of alex and his work
3531269 ive never given a talk in front of more than 30 or 40 people at siggraph the audience will be 300 or 400
3531270 but im excited these are exactly the people i want to show my work to
3531271 when one pixel covers a large area in a 3d video game landscape what color should that pixel be it can only be one color but the area it covers may contain many different colors
3531272 our main finding was that reward dependence is the only personality dimension correlated with opiate receptor binding and that positive correlation was restricted to the ventral striatum which is considered the key area of the human reward system and of the development of addictive behavior
3531273 this correlation means that people with high reward dependence have a high concentration of opiate receptors available in that area while people with low dependence have fewer opiate receptors
3531274 this is a novel finding and will provide a deeper understanding of the functional relation between human personality neurobiology and addictive behavior
3531275 understanding the central role of neurotransmission processes in certain brain structures for the expression of psychologically defined constructs such as personality will make a great difference in the future of medicine
3531276 increased alcohol outcomes among reserve guard personnel deployed with combat exposures is concerning in light of increased reliance on these forces
3531277 active duty marines were also found to be at increased odds of continuing to binge drink after deployment as well as to experience new onset alcohol related problems

3531288 excessive speculation in any commodity under contrasts of sale of such commodities for future deliver causing sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in the prices of such commodity is an undue and unnecessary burden on interstate commerce in such commodity

3531295 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3531296 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3531297 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3531298 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3531299 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3531300 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3531301 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3531302 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3531303 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3531304 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3531305 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3531306 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3531307 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3531308 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3531309 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3531310 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3531311 you want people to think well of you dont you
3531312 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3531313 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3531314 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3531315 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3531316 this signals to me that oxbow jail will finally after a decade of being mothballed be opened and begin servicing the citizens that have demanded that it be placed back in use
3531317 hes my family but we need a pitcher that can help us now not next season
3531318 mando pop mandarin pop music is characterized by softness no hard edges are exposed where young people might cut themselves some independent thinking no difficult subject matter interferes with the music from mesmerizing young minds the typical male mando pop star is a designed metrosexual reasonably good looking his hair never long is designed to gently fracture his face the eyes possibly kohl shadowed it is permissible to unbutton the shirt exposing an oiled or sparkled hairless chest wiry thin dressed in dark tones or blinding bright colors the male mando pop star whispers his song never yelling at least until the penultimate moment when all the girls will have their hearts stolen as the music in its crescendo closing requires our star to give it all he has in the audience hearts and glow sticks are all a flutter one possibly two well mannered girls jump up on stage with bouquets of flowers our male star offers his cheek which the two girls shyly kiss to the orgasmic cheer of the audience glow sticks flutter double time for the typical mando pop female star perfect in her makeup dress and hair must be wistful wishful and virginal no sex allowed that is reserved for japanese korean and taiwanese pop stars if she can produce a tear not during the song but when her adoring fans shriek her name through their glow sticks a tear that she wipes away ever so gently with a single finger then her concert will be considered a smash the songs are soft breathy love ballads almost spoken and with the one essential quality that guarantees their success they can be sung by anyone it is in the ktv parlors that a star quality is manufactured hundreds of thousands of locations throughout china require the latest superstar efforts to be available for local singing fans 15 to 25 years old to duplicate the sounds of their favorites if you can sell your songs to the ktv palaces you are ensured stardom the kids cant sing rock n roll so dont bother making it its just too western for sensitive chinese ears and rock n roll just might tell the kids something they do not even want to hear
3531319 while young chinese people are fascinated with overseas culture that culture is most often presented to them in a highly controlled fashion western culture with chinese characteristics
3531320 where there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime we vigorously prosecute
3531321 but not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
3531322 that does not mean as some people have suggested that those officials who were found by the joint reports to have committed misconduct have suffered no consequences
3531323 far from it the officials most directly implicated in the misconduct left the department to the accompaniment of substantial negative publicity
3531324 their misconduct has now been laid bare by the justice department for all to see
3531325 as a general matter in such cases where disciplinary referrals are appropriate they are made to put it in concrete terms i doubt that anyone in this room would want to trade places with any of those people
3531326 when you really want something all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it
3531327 and the trouble is if you dont risk anything you risk even more
3531328 he should be in myrtle beach if hes going to take a vacation at this time
3531329 its what you learn after you know it all that counts
3531330 these poll results demonstrate that parents are as apprehensive about their childrens media diets as they are about traditional social issues such as alcohol drugs violence and sex
3531331 when it comes to video games parents should know that what they play is a resource that helps demystify one of the most popular and challenging forms of entertainment their kids are into
3531332 although these findings seem surprising at first they hint at fears parents have about video games
3531333 to some parents video games are full of unknowable dangers while researching for grand theft childhood parents we spoke with in focus groups often bemoaned the fact that they didnt know how to use game controls and felt unequipped to supervise or limit video game play of course parents dont want their children drinking alcohol but thats a more familiar risk
3531334 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3531335 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3531336 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3531337 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3531338 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3531339 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3531340 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3531341 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3531342 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3531343 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3531344 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3531345 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3531346 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3531347 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3531348 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3531349 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3531350 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3531351 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3531352 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3531353 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3531354 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3531355 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3531356 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3531357 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3531358 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3531359 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3531360 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3531361 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3531362 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3531363 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3531364 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3531365 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3531366 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3531367 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3531368 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3531369 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3531370 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3531371 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3531372 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3531373 the spirit is right the team responded well as did the crowd so im satisfied
3531374 we need the two weeks of training before the second leg because as could be seen we arent continuously sharp yet but we were also quite tidy today
3531375 a deal has been reached between president mugabe and mdc mutambara faction which has been signed in the presence of president mbeki

3531390 evidence had been lost or destroyed nearly two thirds of the time that prosecutors agreed to search for it because ohio does not require evidence to be catalogued and saved
3531391 why are our supermarkets filled with cosmetics from johnson and johnson that promise to brighten your color and return you to the fairness of your youth
3531392 why when how why did we go back to that place where looking more white was the preferred state
3531393 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3531394 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3531395 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3531396 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3531397 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3531398 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3531399 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3531400 saturday i had everything i had everything i could ever want
3531401 voter id opponents and those who believe the current system is a ok have semi successfully painted this as a republican vs democrat issue too bad we know plenty of democrats in wisconsin support such measures as id at the polls too the goal is not to restrict voting rather it is to ensure that every legal vote is counted what are its opponents afraid of
3531402 it never ceases to amaze me the amount of energy that can go into a project just to avoid doing the right thing the best simplest least costly most effective thing we could do is expand what has been working so well for years medicare you get sick you get care and the caregiver gets paid nothing could be simpler but follow the money and youll find why the politicians dont like it a bit they get their money from insurance interests
3531403 america will always do the right thing but only after everything else fails
3531404 as a business owner if i had an employee giving company assets to outsiders in exchange for money on the side id fire him perhaps even have him jailed in any other venue we call it bribery payola and theft but in the american political system we call it freedom of speech we dont jail them we re elect them
3531405 since the arabic opec conspiracy has eliminated all pretense of a capitalistic free market the u s should create its own energy supply with a taxpayer funded exploration division contract it to the lowest private bidder if need be but introduce some real competition into the system
3531406 unfortunately our political system has fallen not to the republicans or democrats but to the corporate interests that fund their elections and that is not going to change in november the only real solution is a complete turnover at the state and national level we need voter initiated term limits
3531407 privatization is the political preference because private corporations can give campaign contributions and government entities cant we are paying ten times the dollars for blackwater bechtel and halliburton to perform the same functions our troops could be performing in iraq why because the us army cannot give campaign contributions get the political money out of the system and if privatization continues because it makes more sense than creating another government bureaucracy then fine but if it continues because political cash is flowing then it likely wasnt needed in the first place

3531416 i can be clear that it is not our policy to reduce the level of the award to a victim of rape due to alcohol consumption
3531417 this was a mistake in their interpretation of the guidelines
3531418 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3531419 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3531420 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3531421 for me the bottom line was finding the right coach for our organization at this time
3531422 it was a rigorous interview process extremely thorough i dont want any perception the other candidates werent qualified or werent good people because they were i just found the candidate thats the right coach for our organization scott gordon really stood out
3531423 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3531424 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3531425 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3531426 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3531427 of the summer olympic games i thought that was team handball whats most interesting about tonights contest is the underlying controversy triggered the always shifty gymnastics coach bela karolyi who said the chinese team is entirely made up of
3531428 in the short term it is business as usual we dont rely on dr thaksins money when mark hughes makes a decision we go through the normal process which can include banks finance or a whole bunch of different things just like any other club
3531429 he is willing to look at whatever it takes to make city a great football club this is a guy who loves city
3531430 it was really clear he wants to be at this football club for the next 10 years he wants to build a dynasty and he was disappointed that people think he wanted to get in and back out
3531431 i think he realises we werent too far away from them when they were playing at the very top of their game
3531432 with the injuries and stuff that has been going on at our place we as players can all raise the bar a little bit and with it being that close with us missing out by two points on the premiership and in the champions league final i think they know that every year were going to give them a right good run for their money
3531433 it still hurts me to see pictures of united lifting the trophy at wigan last season we made that trophy ours when jose mourinho first took over we want it back and thats what were aiming for
3531434 frank and didier know now theyre at chelsea and weve got to make it happen this year
3531435 hopefully things can get resolved with frank with the contract as hes been our best player for the last four of five years and we want to keep him
3531436 scolaris a very experienced man like ferguson and knows exactly what hes doing im sure the managers got a few tricks up his sleeve along the way hes a quiet man and doesnt want to get involved in the mind games and hopefully we can stop him getting involved by taking an early lead in the premiership and leading the way
3531437 ive been awfully lucky to get the armband in the past and those memories will stay with me forever but its one man making the big decision hes taken his time and hell make the right decision whoever he chooses ill fully respect if its not me ill walk up to the person shake their hand and wish them well england can move on from that point
3531438 arsenal are a club that always gives young players the opportunity at the highest level
3531439 the biggest game of the season certainly is the qualifier for the champions league
3531440 if you lose a premier league game you can still get back lose a champions league qualifier and its a big deal our two main targets are the premier league and the champions league the champions league can only be a target if we qualify
3531441 its a lot of responsibility on ramsey because money is an issue but its not just money its our sporting target as well we want to be in the champions league its a big game for us
3531442 i believe he has the ingredients to become a good player
3531443 he has confidence and is a hard worker he has a fantastic engine he has a good build and he has a reasonable technique although i think he has to improve on that
3531444 he has a lot to learn he has to improve the defensive aspect of his game the positioning on the pitch i dont think he has the tricks to play wide i have never played him wide i dont think i will because it doesnt look to me that he has the dribbling skills
3531445 looking at the way my players behave i dont think there is any danger of complacency
3531446 if you go to holland you have a big game
3531447 i have been in this job 10 years now and i sense a mood for something to happen
3531448 if we had mentioned this three years ago i think the reaction would have been different now everyone club chairmen managers players officials fans media are all saying we saw things last season that overstepped the mark
3531449 its unfair to pick one person or one club out because weve all committed it
3531450 i could show you 100 videos of different players and different clubs committing offences
3531451 we still need the tackles flying in and the high tempo in games to let games flow and the referees also have a responsibility as well but the important thing is there is now some consistency there are now rules last year was there or wasnt there a rule where you couldnt surround the referee i couldnt tell you now theres a rule you cant its the captain who has that responsibility to go and speak to the referee the others guys are going to get booked now we all know that theres some consistency from the referees association from the panel from the players
3531452 i dont have much choice its a young one or a younger one it is always a bit tricky when you have players come back for pre season so late
3531453 you try to rush the fitness when you have champions league qualifiers and some of them get injuries thats what has happened with cesc who only returned on july 29 from the european championship its the most problematic start to a season numbers wise we are short of one player and i hope to do something this week or before the transfer deadline
3531454 if rangers had still been in europe i think carlos would have stayed for another season he would probably have liked another go at the champions league after all he isnt going to get that at aston villa but with rangers out so early and with no uefa cup football either he must have thought it was time to go its a major blow because no team likes to lose their best players and he had a great season for us
3531455 its just sad that rangers and celtic seem to be a stepping stone for players these days there was a time when other clubs were a stepping stone to the old firm but that is no longer the case
3531456 youll appreciate these lessons one day just like i appreciate them now
3531457 even if we signed a player today he could not play against standard li ge so i am not worried about that situation i am only concentrating on the game
3531458 i am really calm about the situation i dont have any problems i am not distracted i am focused only on this game
3531459 they have not played together much so far and it will take time but as a partnership they can be as good as anyone in this competition
3531460 he is progressing really well but we will check after training
3531461 i will also speak to the doctor and to steven before making a decision about whether he is ready to play
3531462 we have alvaro arbeloa and if we have any problems we can put carra jamie carragher on the right
3531463 i have had a great pre season run and am the fittest i have ever been i am really looking forward to this season and know i can do a job for the team
3531464 its not going to be easy for me but i am up for the fight and am working very hard my english has improved and i have settled well in liverpool now i need the chance to prove my quality
3531465 for a friendly it is nice to bring one or two young ones in i might introduce one or two experienced players for the world cup qualifers but there wont be major changes we have the nucleus of an outstanding team
3531466 i saw kris a lot when i was the manager of derby
3531467 hes very skilful i spoke to paul jewell who says he is as good a player as he has worked with we dont really have a natural left winger who can go past people
3531468 ive named a big squad and we hopefully wont lose any more than one or two this time
3531469 it will be great to see james mcfadden he hasnt been in my squad yet but we all know what he can do
3531470 financially newcastle united was in a difficult positon because i really do think that it had over extended itself
3531471 we first heard about the potential sale on a saturday and had the deal done by the wednesday so if you are asking if we did due diligence before buying then the answer has to be no
3531472 one of the most unfortunate things about newcastle uniteds finances at that time was the amount of money still owed on players signed in comparison to the amount of income that was due in off players who had gone
3531473 there is still 27m net to pay on transfers that were done before i came so probably in the latter years before we came in you could argue that the club was beginning to lose its way it had also already taken upfront payments from commerical deals and sponsorships which didnt help us at all it seemed as though the club was in a very downward sprial one it would have found very hard to come out of
3531474 apart from the purchase of the club and the associated costs that come with that ive put in a further 100m to reduce debts yet we still have the outstanding debt of the monies still owed on player transfers
3531475 one of the jewels one of the diamonds of the premier league
3531476 i wear my strip and go in with the fans because thats how ive always gone to football and i enjoy it nothing beats the atmosphere of being in with the fans its tremendous to be part of
3531477 kevin is a great manager and he is happiest working with the players
3531478 but theres so much involved in running a club that you must make sure people arent spread too thinly how could kevin devote all his time to the first team if he also had to look after the academy thats where dennis wise comes in
3531479 we didnt start the speculation and thats now gone away we want to make the company successful profitable and continue its growth
3531480 the market is where it is i dont think theres going to be a great deal of mergers and acquisitions activity its not on the agenda probably for years rather than months
3531481 a very powerful and effective set of rights it is one of a number you need in order to be an attractive service
3531482 however these products were sent to establishments and retail stores nationwide for further processing and will likely not bear the establishment number
3531483 consumers who have purchased recalled product should either throw the product away or return it to point of purchase
3531484 manchester united made an offer for david silva but this has been turned down by valencia
3531485 silva doesnt want to play in england because he is happy at valencia his family are settled and if he was to move it would only be to another spanish club like real madrid or barcelona david silva will start the new season at valencia
3531486 valencia have the power in their hands david silva cant go to another team because he has a contract for five more years
3531487 i can assure you that villa and silva will continue this season at valencia
3531488 financially newcastle united was in a difficult position because i really do think that it had over extended itself
3531489 we first heard about the potential sale on a saturday and had the deal done by the wednesday so if you are asking if we did due diligence before buying then the answer has to be no
3531490 there is still 27m net to pay on transfers that were done before i came so probably in the latter years before we came in you could argue that the club was beginning to lose its way it had also already taken up front payments from commercial deals and sponsorships which didnt help us at all
3531491 we do not believe that an internal provincial police investigation would be seen as fair transparent objective or credible enough to bring all the answers that people are looking for
3531492 we found this meeting very positive and it allowed the families to ask questions which we answered
3531493 we reassured the family that we are taking this investigation seriously this inquiry will be handled with integrity impartiality and with rigour
3531494 were not at the point where we have to meet these people right away
3531495 the advantage of a public inquiry is that it will look for the motives that feed this hatred of the police system
3531496 the other advantage of a public inquiry is that we will be able to analyze the intervention methods of police
3531497 the desktop pc market around the world weakened during the quarter
3531498 in contrast the rest of our businesses did not exhibit the same dynamics as our desktop business
3531499 the notebook gpu mcp and professional solutions groups grew a combined 27 percent year over year
3531500 senator mccain opened his remarks talking about his conversation with the georgian president talking about the crisis there saying that he believes that there is a true strategic imperative for the world to take notice and make sure that georgia is protected because of its oil pipeline one that does provide energy access across the caspian sea the black sea a very very important position for energy independence for the united states to make sure that those sorts of things are protected
3531501 its not bad for a country that has no swimming pools and very little soap
3531502 i dont know anything about the average australians use of soap
3531503 old rivals like australia are saying they are in danger of falling behind team gb in the medal table
3531504 british sportsmen and women in the past have been known to choke under the pressure when up against the aussies
3531505 this independent report does not reflect conservative party policy and we do not agree with its conclusions we wholeheartedly support the regeneration of northern cities
3531506 many of britains towns and cities have failed and been failed by policy makers for too long
3531507 coastal cities whether large like liverpool and hull or small like scunthorpe and blackpool are most vulnerable they are almost always at the end of the line they have lost their raison detre as ports and it is hard to imagine them prospering at their current sizes
3531508 sunderland demonstrates just how hard it is to regenerate such a city it is time to stop pretending there is a bright future for sunderland and ask ourselves instead what we need to do to offer people in sunderland better prospects
3531509 cities based on highly skilled workers are the most dynamic oxford and cambridge are unambiguously britains leading research universities outside london
3531510 no one is suggesting that residents should be forced to move but we do argue that they should be told the reality of the position
3531511 this report from david camerons favourite thinktank has just dismissed a huge area of the country as worthless is it any wonder there are no tory councillors in liverpool when for all their warm words they have not changed a bit
3531512 poor general health record compared to other parts of the country
3531513 we are looking for stores in deprived areas that do not currently sell fruit and veg and or stores in less deprived areas where there are limited places to buy fruit and veg
3531514 we are relying on the convenience store groups to identify stores that meet these criteria and well then check to make sure weve got a good mix across the region
3531515 the healthy stores initiative will not mean that shopkeepers will stop selling crisps sweets fizzy drinks and other unhealthy snacks they will just make room for and promote more fresh fruit and vegetables
3531516 obesity is the biggest health challenge we face it causes 9 000 people to die prematurely every year it costs the nhs 4 2bn and the economy 16bn per year
3531517 a government led movement that will help everyone change the way they live and live healthier lives
3531518 we know that families in some communities still use the corner shop on a daily basis for their food and other household goods it is therefore essential we take healthy eating options to these stores and reach those families who are at the greatest risk of poor health due to a poor diet
3531519 consumer habits are shifting people shop around at different outlets several times a week so its important that people have the opportunity to buy fresh fruit and vegetables where it is convenient for them
3531520 through a series of freak occurrences a group of actors shooting a big budget war movie are forced to become the soldiers they are portraying
3531521 it was even worse than the hateful stuff they used in promoting it
3531522 an r rated comedy that satirizes hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters in ridiculous situations
3531523 its never funny when good and decent human beings are humiliated
3531524 in fact it is dangerous and disgusting this film is all that and more
3531525 this data allows investigators to identify suspects examine their contacts establish relationships between conspirators and place them in a specific location at a certain time
3531526 it also gives investigators the potential to identify other forensic opportunities identify witnesses and premises of evidential interest many alibis are proven or refuted through the use of communications data without the ec directive investigative opportunities will be increasingly lost
3531527 we will be told it is for use in combating terrorism and organised crime but if ripa powers are anything to go by it will soon be used to spy on ordinary peoples kids pets and bins
3531528 yet again the government have proved themselves unable to resist the temptation to take a power quite properly designed to combat terrorism to snoop on the lives of ordinary people in everyday circumstances
3531529 she was conscientious to the point of doggedness and delivered quality reports on time she had a quality of making other people think that they were funny and clever and a knack of getting them to do her bidding
3531530 conduct issues in good faith based on the facts available to them
3531531 i can be clear that it is not our policy to reduce the level of the award to a victim of rape due to alcohol consumption
3531532 this was a mistake in their interpretation of the guidelines
3531533 i joined the unit more or less agnostic on drugs policy being personally opposed to drug use but open minded about the best way to deal with the problem
3531534 i was certainly not inclined to decriminalise however during my time in the unit as i saw more and more evidence of what works to quote new labours mantra of the time it became apparent to me that enforcement and supply side interventions were largely pointless they have no significant lasting impact on the availability affordability or use of drugs
3531535 i think what was truly depressing about my time in ukadcu was that the overwhelming majority of professionals i met including those from the police the health service the government and voluntary sectors held the same view the illegality of drugs causes far more problems for society and the individual than it solves yet publicly all those intelligent knowledgeable people were forced to repeat the nonsensical mantra that the government would be tough on drugs even though they all knew the governments policy was actually causing harm
3531536 tobacco is a legal drug whose use is declining and precisely because it is legal its users are far more amenable to government control education programmes and taxation
3531537 the idea that many people are holding back solely because of a law which they know is already unenforceable is simply ridiculous
3531538 julian critchley is one of the brave few to tell the truth about the failure of prohibition and the need to replace it with a system of regulation
3531539 it is truly shameful that there are so many more who know that the war on drugs is overwhelmingly counterproductive and yet continue to remain silent tacitly endorsing a policy that they know creates misery degradation and death for millions across the globe
3531540 it is vital the cica understands that women are not responsible for mens criminality because they have a drink or for any other reason
3531541 nobody would suggest that if someones wallet was stolen after having a drink then their compensation should be reduced
3531542 as far as we in the government are concerned a victim of rape is not in any way at all culpable due to alcohol consumption
3531543 as i understand it the cica have accepted that the guidelines were being misapplied i hope that the compensation authority will look at these other cases that they believe may also have had the guidelines misinterpreted and review them without the victims themselves having to go back and ask for that review
3531544 if an applicant accepts our decision then that case is finalised and closed
3531545 if they wish to ask for a review they must do this themselves in writing
3531546 contributed to the circumstances which gave rise to the injury
3531547 old prejudices like if a woman is wearing a short skirt or acting in a certain way are still operational
3531548 by reducing compensation because a woman has been drinking the cica is operating under those old prejudices
3531549 the scheme was originally applied wrongly in this case but this was corrected at review and the award was paid in full
3531550 it is not our policy to reduce the level of award to a victim of rape due to alcohol consumption this supports our view that a victim of rape is not in anyway culpable due to alcohol consumption
3531551 a victim of rape should not have any compensation reduced because of their drinking i hope that the compensation authority will look at these other cases
3531552 perception of crime tends to be affected most by television and newspaper coverage while at local level it tends to be more informed by a residents own experiences of the area
3531553 there is a tendency for residents to overstate crime with non criminal antisocial behaviour often mistakenly viewed by local residents as examples of criminal behaviour
3531554 any community experiencing high levels of crime is at a disadvantage and faces a greater challenge in creating a quality of life offer that is important to longer term sustainability
3531555 tragedies when the media and public confuse association with causality and shun immunisation
3531556 the sheer repetition of the idea that the mmr vaccine might be linked to autism appeared to have influenced public understanding
3531557 it is a political document it is an agreement of principles and i think we have full coincidence of principles
3531558 these are temporary arrangements now but later it should be replaced by international process
3531559 its addressing a couple of those key ways that we feel blogging is evolving
3531560 theres definitely convergence happening where people are looking to build a community around a topic of interest something like ning tends to be more sort of a general purpose community that doesnt necessarily have a publishing or content aspect to its core
3531561 this was very much a business focused announcement and the new features and capabilities really speak to critical needs for mobile business professionals
3531562 theyve incorporated all their latest and greatest service features and these new products are better able to take advantage of the changing needs of business professionals
3531563 when we started developing these systems 18 months ago we focused on the biggest pain points for users and managers alike and worked to turn those into features that address the problems
3531564 why are people surprised that im a social worker who writes novels
3531565 if i were still in childrens services it might be different
3531566 that work can leave you emotionally exhausted but i still enjoy what i do perhaps because im now in the positive zone of social work im at the beginning of a process that is looking to provide children with the opportunity of a better future anyway
3531567 if you have an enormous amount of time on your hands you dont always get down to the business of writing
3531568 we spent most of our time with a scraper or paintbrush in our hands
3531569 but as time went on i had a nagging feeling that i was living in a bubble miles away from the real world
3531570 he died when i was 11 giving me the opportunity to feel sorry for myself as a semi orphan around that time i first read david copperfield and immediately identified with the lone child hero
3531571 it wasnt the done thing to reveal those kind of secrets in those days
3531572 people who knew about dickens and ellen ternan the mistress remained loyal to him and so did catherine after his death she bequeathed to the nation his early letters to her so the world might know that he loved me once as she put it
3531573 but im also interested in how he could behave so badly bearing in mind his sensitivity to people and his feelings for the poor and downtrodden
3531574 yes but i believe that he was a man who still valued goodness and must have been disappointed with himself i suspect that he went through all kinds of psychological convolutions to square it
3531575 well he certainly believed in practical action and the capacity of individuals to make a difference
3531576 he gave an immense amount of time to all sorts of projects including sailing clubs for boys and small hospitals in the east end of london but as a former parliamentary reporter i dont think hed have much time for systems imposed by politicians when i started in childrens services in 1969 most of my work was preventive by the time i finished in 1996 there was far more statutory child protection work when things have gone wrong there have been public inquiries with the consequence of more centrally imposed systems
3531577 but he was also very paternalistic you can tell that from the novels women are rarely strong characters in their own right unless theyre comic figures heaven knows what hed have made of modern women he once took a girl to the police station because she swore at him in the street
3531578 mainly neglected fiction and non fiction by women for women and about women
3531579 we had the finest cookery in the world but it had been nearly lost by neglect
3531580 this is not simply a burst of energy we are going to be making records and writing songs were still in the process of forming as a band we need a keyboard player im not good enough to do it all myself so that will be rectified soon
3531581 that song is a response to the way we saw the u s government try to reframe the conflicts of the world particularly when the soviet union had collapsed there was no way to subject the country to the kind of fear needed to justify what i consider to be an ill distribution of wealth after 9 11 you could see that reframing taking place the specter of communism no longer haunted the u s justifying its actions in latin america and all over the world what filled that void were al qaeda and the muslim world in general that song is in an abstract way addressing the way the right has distracted people from this huge rush of wealth from the bottom to the top
3531582 beyond that im speaking toward a deeper sentiment that i feel and i know a lot of people feel most of the songs have to do with redemptive moments that come in the face of some real indignity and thats the current that im trying to tap into because i think that for a lot of people for the real participants who live in the shadows and work at car washes and are forced to cross the border and are struggling and facing the real economic consequences theyre often left out off the debate because of the language they speak or even the terminology that they use so it stems from my own frustration it stems from seeing how things have been developing politically and watching so much dissatisfaction and people very upset about the way the country is going and watching all of that frustration steered back into a more traditional political process the problems stem far deeper than anything that brother obama can address and eventually people are going to have to respond
3531583 would not be in the best interest of the community
3531584 she was very pleased at the division of paroles decision
3531585 good for them how exciting well miss them and well pray for them
3531586 this is the third time its happened and always at the end of the month when we have the mortgage and wages to pay but luckily one of our supporters has stepped in with a personal interest free loan
3531587 i dont think wed be here today if it wasnt for the funding of the biodiversity work
3531588 when we realised the value of what we had we tapped into things such as natur gwynedd a biodiversity fund that was a huge support to us
3531589 when we started growing veg those fields attracted huge flocks of birds such as linnets and yellowhammers in the winter
3531590 because we werent farming too tidily there were lots of weed seeds and insects for them
3531591 ive never worked in an ips or such a complex co operative environment or been a farmer or had a piece of land bigger than my garden to be responsible for for all of us its been life changing
3531592 then when the market garden manager left i got the job
3531593 im paid two days a week and work as a volunteer for the rest of the time i love it
3531594 between 1991 2001 telford and wrekin was amongst the top most rapidly growing authorities in england
3531595 telford rose like a phoenix from the ashes of our industrial past and brought wealth and employment back to a depressed area
3531596 hoje nosso jogo da vida contra o flamengo pr xima rodada no domingo temos que nos doar e fazer o m ximo no domingo o t cnico m rcio fernandes tem nosso apoio e confian a
3531597 estamos recebendo apoio incondicional da torcida esperamos sair de campo felizes no domingo
3531598 it should be pretty easy for video game developers to integrate our research into new games as a game developer myself i know first hand that stretched out and flickering backgrounds and details are no longer acceptable in 3d video games
3531599 people are looking for ways to get rid of these distortions preferably without having to pay artists to generate background and detail images by hand we have come up with a way to do this and we are planning to provide code for download soon
3531600 the existing methods for using computer generated noise to make images for backgrounds and details for 3d video games are fast but the images that you get dont look very good our work gives you the full computational benefit of noise but without many of the tradeoffs such as distortion and flickering
3531601 the graphics generated from the procedural approach that we explored in this project are very small illustrating video games with small images is going to be increasingly important in the future as more and more games are downloadable
3531602 getting a paper into siggraph is an accomplishment for any senior researcher in computer graphics presenting a paper in siggraph based on work done as an undergraduate is astonishing were very proud of alex and his work
3531603 ive never given a talk in front of more than 30 or 40 people at siggraph the audience will be 300 or 400
3531604 but im excited these are exactly the people i want to show my work to
3531605 when one pixel covers a large area in a 3d video game landscape what color should that pixel be it can only be one color but the area it covers may contain many different colors
3531606 using x rays to find solutions to earth science questions is an area that has been highly active on the srs at daresbury laboratory for some time we are very excited that the srs has contributed to answering such long standing questions about the earth in this way
3531607 the resources available at daresburys srs for high pressure research have been crucial in helping us determine the origin of these diamonds and their inclusions
3531608 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs
3531609 i notice a lot of people walking around and if the kids are outside they just stare them down
3531610 we never give them a paper bag if they purchase a single bottle
3531611 we give them a clear plastic bag and i say no drinking outside
3531612 we call the cops once in awhile but we dont have too much trouble i know every face and where they live
3531613 its busy and with that there are a lot of people walking around and lots of things going on
3531614 theyre trying to get you to go to one of those sites
3531615 youre unpatched and you click on one of these links you can get yourself infected
3531616 theyre less effective versus trying to create a website that has been programmed to take advantage of those vulnerabilities
3531617 we see a real need for small companies to take the data that exists across their organizations and turn it into business insight
3531618 she was conscientious to the point of doggedness and delivered quality reports on time she had a quality of making other people think that they were funny and clever and a knack of getting them to do her bidding

3531626 history has shown time and time again that if you leave aggression to go unchecked you only store up graver problems for the future
3531627 for moscow the message from the bucharest compromise was that pressure works
3531628 this data allows investigators to identify suspects examine their contacts establish relationships between conspirators and place them in a specific location at a certain time
3531629 it also gives investigators the potential to identify other forensic opportunities identify witnesses and premises of evidential interest many alibis are proven or refuted through the use of communications data without the ec directive investigative opportunities will be increasingly lost

3531644 this independent report does not reflect conservative party policy and we do not agree with its conclusions we wholeheartedly support the regeneration of northern cities
3531645 many of britains towns and cities have failed and been failed by policy makers for too long
3531646 coastal cities whether large like liverpool and hull or small like scunthorpe and blackpool are most vulnerable they are almost always at the end of the line they have lost their raison detre as ports and it is hard to imagine them prospering at their current sizes

3531649 no one is suggesting that residents should be forced to move but we do argue that they should be told the reality of the position
3531650 this report from david camerons favourite thinktank has just dismissed a huge area of the country as worthless is it any wonder there are no tory councillors in liverpool when for all their warm words they have not changed a bit
3531651 and when he was at the place he said unto them pray that ye enter not into temptation
3531652 and being in an agony he prayed more earnestly and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground
3531653 david has been very clear all along that the play is complete fiction unlike stuff happens and the permanent way it is not a documentary play it is fiction a theatrical and imaginative response to the governing class
3531654 it is a political document it is an agreement of principles and i think we have full coincidence of principles
3531655 i think its very clear that russian ambitions are to restore the old russian empire
3531656 you have to be clearheaded about that kind of regime
3531657 mccains been much more clear sighted than the bush administration or many of our allies in europe
3531658 this is a guy who grew up in the cold war was a military person and an honorable man but has not changed his ways of thinking about russia
3531659 explaining with precision what we dont like about their behavior rather than saying he looked into putins eyes and saw kgb that has an adolescent quality that gets us exactly nowhere
3531660 speaking directly to the russians as opposed to in some pugnacious cold war fashion is what this modern challenge needs
3531661 what russia needs to know is that it will be globally ostracized and barack obamas global approach is different from the state to state balance of power approach that is visible in the mccain talking points
3531662 he was a reaganite in the cold war that was a pro democracy anti communist approach
3531663 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3531664 they just dont want freedom and thats why they want to stamp on georgia and destroy it
3531665 but this time the explosion came so abruptly i dont remember what happened afterward
3531666 old times cnn his country is seeking details on what started the fighting united states has given a green light to this adventurous act
3531667 but our american colleagues are telling us that theyre investigating now what may have happened in the channels of communication for mr saakashvili to have behaved in such a reckless manner
3531668 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3531669 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
3531670 now i just feel great i have confidence i am happy that is a whole new feeling
3531671 she has gone to counseling she found a job she is now one year drug free
3531672 i kind of never thought that i would succeed i did not join the program thinking i would do it i just wanted to get out of jail
3531673 it showed me that a person from my lifestyle can do what that person can do and i can do it too
3531674 its really really hard with the support of the people around you you can get through it
3531675 you made it you made it and you came over some difficult hurdles for you
3531676 conduct issues in good faith based on the facts available to them
3531677 i can be clear that it is not our policy to reduce the level of the award to a victim of rape due to alcohol consumption
3531678 this was a mistake in their interpretation of the guidelines
3531679 i would have said exactly the reverse you arent going to attract anyone by cheeseparing on the salary
3531680 if i had tried to describe the person i wanted i would have described steve he has absolutely the right experience
3531681 we are seeing a softening or a tempering or some slowing of revenue growth in particular in financial markets but its not nearly to the level that people have been worrying about
3531682 people were thinking we would go negative growth in the second half but all the businesses are quite positive the picture the way i see it is a slight slowing in keeping with the general economy which is slowing down but not the sort of falling out of bed we are seeing in media or some of the banking sector
3531683 people are feeling a little better than they did a few weeks ago but thats fragile and that could change
3531684 there will be some follow on reductions over the next year but the lions share is being done this year
3531685 i hesitate to give a number but my best estimate is over 1 000
3531686 i view this as just a sensible delayering as a result of bringing two companies together
3531687 georgia was one of the 13 colonies that revolted against british rule in the american revolution it was the last of the 13 colonies to be established as a colony it was the fourth state to ratify the united states constitution on january 2 1788

3531690 over the past 18 months i have listened to many local residents and one of the big issues locally is the economy
3531691 thousands of local people are struggling with rising prices and increasing taxes please return the attached survey about how you feel about the economy in brighton and peacehaven it will only take a minute and wont cost you a penny
3531692 the investment bank continues to be negatively affected by the disruption in the credit and mortgage markets as well as by overall lower levels of liquidity and wider credit spreads
3531693 is no longer as much in the right place at the right time
3531694 my personal view is that these conditions could continue until 2010 or even 2011 these are most difficult economic circumstances we have ever seen
3531695 too early to cite definitively a sea change in the market
3531696 potential easing in fundamentals for the second half of 2008 and into 2009
3531697 woolworths is a well loved high street brand operating in attractive markets
3531698 we would hesitate before automatically extrapolating the recent price trend
3531699 add in ever changing sentiment over iran and it looks too early to cite definitively a sea change in the market
3531700 demand for opec oil is going to be lower than its production capacity so the market is looking forward to seeing an inventory build
3531701 the growth is coming from brazil its coming from russia its coming from india its coming from the middle east its very broad based
3531702 its really difficult theres nothing out there at the moment i was working for david wilson for five and a half years trying to find a new job is very hard the companies have either closed down or stopped building most of them are just tidying up loose ends
3531703 a lot of people have been laid off so there are 10 people going for one job getting a job as a bricklayer is not what it used to be i used to be picked up in two days i used to just walk on to a site and ask for a job but they are all caged up now
3531704 im thinking that i might have to re train as i cant see any light at the end of the tunnel but theres not a great lot for a 40 year old brickie to do i cant see myself picking up a trowel for six to nine months
3531705 there is little chance the mpc will cut rates in the next few months and indeed there remains a near term risk that the mpc will hike rates if inflation expectations surge higher again
3531706 the rise in core inflation will clearly leave the mpc concerned that even the sharp slowdown in activity now under way will not be severe enough to prevent a more broad based pick up in inflation while we still think that the mpc could cut interest rates before the end of the year a cut within the next couple of months looks well off the agenda indeed a rate rise is still a possibility
3531707 the most important concern up and down the country is the deteriorating state of our economy hundreds of thousands of families now have the threat of negative equity hanging over them businesses are cutting back unemployment is creeping up and this mornings inflation figures are yet another worrying signal for families desperately trying to make ends meet
3531708 its very clear that were in for a dose of stagflation with the economy slowing abruptly and inflation too high and increasing
3531709 i think everybody recognises that it is not possible for governments to fully insulate whether it is households or businesses from these kinds of world oil prices that we have seen
3531710 tragedies when the media and public confuse association with causality and shun immunisation
3531711 the sheer repetition of the idea that the mmr vaccine might be linked to autism appeared to have influenced public understanding
3531712 the aviation industry has always been a barometer of the wider economy so it should not come as any surprise to see a slight slowdown particularly since the airlines have signalled some cutbacks to services
3531713 we are certainly having to be a bit more careful with the values of houses we are putting on the market
3531714 vendors are having to drop their prices lately weve been embarrassed with some of the offers weve had for a house valued at 200 000 or more people are offering 50 000 less
3531715 we are just finishing houses to a certain level at the moment
3531716 it has been very quiet in the last 12 months
3531717 people are going to out of town centres because car parks are so expensive here there are also too many second hand shops to compete with
3531718 people are more value conscious at the moment they are travelling further afield to come here
3531719 especially a lot more younger people in the last year
3531720 unfortunately the developer has experienced a delay in the opening of the bowling alley due to the original operator going into administration
3531721 cash is becoming increasingly tighter for companies and there has been a reduction in the number of people becoming employed
3531722 theres also a reduction in the amount of interest in entrepreneurship and a drop in the number of people indicating that they are prepared to go into business
3531723 the welsh assembly is not as committed to investment as they were three or four years ago we need to see more investment from the welsh assembly especially in entrepreneurship they are too focused on internal staff costs
3531724 we believe ubs investment bank will not be fully owned and even potentially disposed of by ubs over the next two years
3531725 some of these weaknesses such as the blurring of the true risk reward profile of individual businesses are the source of substantial risk as we have seen in the past few months
3531726 net new money a key indicator of client confidence in ubs was weaker than we had expected the sfr5 5bn outflow from swiss wealth management clients was particularly notable and primarily reflects portfolio diversification in response to ubss reputational damage
3531727 the sale of nedbank would unlock the deep value currently trapped within the group as it would focus the business into a purer life insurer reduce emerging market exposure and increase investor appetite resulting in a re rating
3531728 something ere the end some work of noble note may yet be done
3531729 we have to adapt to the environmental changes that have already taken place or that we can reasonably expect will occur because of climate change
3531730 the city was built with an assumption of an environmental baseline and climate change in many ways changes that baseline
3531731 some of these transformations can potentially be catastrophic as large storms others might be more subtle and difficult to discern over the short term
3531732 she is a very dangerous person no doubt about it
3531733 this is a major haul a major capture for the fbi
3531734 to find someone who has such rich information computer hard drives e mails that is really a major capture
3531735 i asked her to calm down when she came to me she was very upset she was shaking her sunglasses in my face
3531736 i asked her what could i do for you i did everything i thought i could do in that situation
3531737 i looked in her eyes and realized she was looking at the cockpit i positioned myself in front of the cockpit
3531738 i still was trying to understand what was going on because it happened so quick my main concern was i wasnt going to let this lady in the cockpit
3531739 amongst the gorse and heather the granite walls and circles in the mist and rain
3531740 we considered that the department for environment food and rural affairs defra best practice guidance on environmental claims stated that green claims should not be vague or ambiguous for instance by simply trying to give a good impression about general concern for the environment claims should always avoid the vague use of terms such as sustainable green non polluting and so on
3531741 defra had made that recommendation because although sustainable was a widely used term the lack of a universally agreed definition meant that it was likely to be ambiguous and unclear to consumers because we had not seen data that showed how shell was effectively managing carbon emissions from its oil sands projects in order to limit climate change we concluded that the ad was misleading
3531742 their extraction cannot be described as a sustainable process and for shell to claim otherwise was wholly misleading
3531743 development which meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs
3531744 meant helping to meet the worlds growing energy needs in economic social and environmentally responsible ways and that in all their operations they integrated economic environmental and social considerations into their business decision making
3531745 the asas decision to uphold wwfs complaint sends a strong signal to business and industry that greenwash is unacceptable
3531746 if shell were serious about sourcing sustainable energy then they would be far better placed investing in renewable energy such as wind tidal or solar power
3531747 and you cant walk around with chains if youre a known activist because they can be construed as an offensive weapon its harder to construe that with glue
3531748 its difficult for people to move you on the police in britain at least are unlikely to try and rip your hand away and cause injury
3531749 but we feel we have to use it because otherwise a protest can feel a little bit limp we want to up the ante a bit because the message about climate change is a very very urgent one that were trying to get out
3531750 be wowed as you watch them chase their lunch through the air
3531751 the production of bamboo would fall under our perennial crop standards so in theory we could certify the crop but the problem is the processing the process needed to break down the bamboo to make the fibres is very similar to that used to make viscose and weve yet to see a method that would come anywhere close to complying with our production standards people always say bamboo is great because it grows so quickly but so does cotton
3531752 wed be happy to certify bamboo at the soil association if someone could come up with a sustainable method that goes all through the supply chain not just the growing
3531753 although im not a marketing major i have a bit of a trusted reputation after 18 years self promoting
3531754 id like to inform you i had no say in this marketing campaign but if i did things would be different since it is obvious that this poster is boring odd
3531755 it looks like im wearing maybelline water shine diamonds liquid lipstick
3531756 my characters name is now winter solstice and im a hooker with a heart of gold
3531757 absorbing politically and socially astute the hustler who nearly persuaded us to take him seriously as an important black leader
3531758 fascinating prints by artists including edward hopper depicting the us in the first half of the 20th century
3531759 i can do nothing it doesnt depend on what i do any more i dont think critics read my books
3531760 but i always go to the locations when i write a novel in this case some of the locations were so impressive that the idea for the film came from that
3531761 i enjoyed the preparation of the movie i mean the period immediately before the shooting when you choose everything all the details when you create the world i enjoyed a lot of the shooting too
3531762 bauchau has something in him that is to do with sincere spirituality
3531763 he gives the impression of someone who believes in something that is honest
3531764 few beings have ever been so impregnated pierced to the core by the conviction of the absolute futility of human aspiration
3531765 i tried but they are extremely boring i dont understand their success
3531766 the actors are good but that in my opinion was the only good thing technically it is not very good the script is not good
3531767 it is disgusting i dont like people talking about my private life
3531768 i am always looking for a compromise between a nice place and somewhere not too far from an airport
3531769 it needs personal discipline not to look at the internet
3531770 it is human temptation to read what is said about you but you have to resist
3531771 i think i will come back to writing for a while
3531772 the activity that they disrupted was producing power which persons were engaged in on that land the protesters did an act namely disrupting the running of the power station by causing the water inlet cooling system to be shut down
3531773 no there was no disruption at all it was a normal day the station ran as we planned which was not very much because it was a saturday and coal stations do not run very much on saturdays because there isnt that much heavy industry running
3531774 if we dont then we can expect unlimited daily fines from the european court of justice
3531775 this is due entirely to the governments failure to comply with who based air quality laws that have been around for nearly 10 years
3531776 i see that the air quality is not too much worse than say los angeles in 1984 or athens in 2004 perhaps a bigger concern for the marathon is the guy with a camera on a motorcycle right in front of the runners
3531777 weve been following oil and gas development in the amazon since 2004 and the picture has changed before our eyes
3531778 when you look at where the oil and gas blocks are they overlap perfectly on top of the peak biodiversity spots almost as if by design and this is in one of the most if not the most biodiverse place on earth
3531779 the real concern is when exploration is successful and a zone moves into the development phase because thats when the roads drilling and pipelines come in
3531780 theyre not looking at the bigger picture of what happens if there are lots of projects going on at the same time
3531781 you could have each individual company thinking theyre being relatively responsible and keeping their own road networks under control and so on but what happens when you have 15 other projects around you all of a sudden when you look at the bigger picture you have a sprawling road network
3531782 the way that oil development is being pursued in the western amazon is a gross violation of the rights of the indigenous peoples of the region
3531783 international agreements and inter american human rights law recognise indigenous peoples have rights to their lands and explicitly prohibit the granting of concessions to exploit natural resources in their territories without their free prior and informed consent
3531784 we need incentives tax credits and subsidies that are in place for a much longer time so theres less uncertainty
3531785 were sorry but we tried to inform you of the cancellation by email
3531786 sir im going to confer with my supervisor may i just place you on hold for two to three minutes please
3531787 cancellation fee is 25 up to the total cost of your reservation
3531788 he told us im just one of you guys tonight
3531789 create the most capable and effective u s distributor network in the business
3531790 this is the third time its happened and always at the end of the month when we have the mortgage and wages to pay but luckily one of our supporters has stepped in with a personal interest free loan
3531791 i dont think wed be here today if it wasnt for the funding of the biodiversity work
3531792 when we realised the value of what we had we tapped into things such as natur gwynedd a biodiversity fund that was a huge support to us
3531793 when we started growing veg those fields attracted huge flocks of birds such as linnets and yellowhammers in the winter
3531794 because we werent farming too tidily there were lots of weed seeds and insects for them
3531795 ive never worked in an ips or such a complex co operative environment or been a farmer or had a piece of land bigger than my garden to be responsible for for all of us its been life changing
3531796 then when the market garden manager left i got the job
3531797 im paid two days a week and work as a volunteer for the rest of the time i love it
3531798 we had an issue with 3 5 update 2 its actually a licensing problem
3531799 currently what we know is that licensing prevents new virtual machines from powering up after shutdowns and it prevents virtual motioning moving a virtual machine from one host to another
3531800 customers should not stop virtual machines keep virtual machines going until we release a patch
3531801 you can also move the clock backwards on the server
3531802 vmware engineering has isolated the root cause of this issue and will reissue the various upgrade media including the esx 3 5 update 2 iso esxi 3 5 update 2 iso esx 3 5 update 2 upgrade tar and zip files by noon pst on 13 august these will be available from the page http www vmware com download vi until then vmware advises against upgrading to esx esxi 3 5 update 2 the update patch bundles will be released separately later in the week
3531803 there are raised eyebrows about the competition from the publicly funded lender
3531804 the majority of lending continues to be on conservative terms as lending criteria have tightened in response to the shortage of funding and current market conditions
3531805 these reductions will provide some relief for customers coming off fixed rate were seeing strong competition in the market and some easing in fixed rates and that adds up to a good result for customers
3531806 what you learn from failure can be as valuable as success
3531807 its the expectation effect and dealing with immense disappointment or success can be difficult the important thing is how people deal with a setback and using it as a constructive way to make themselves mentally tougher and more able to deal with future failures
3531808 no one is immune to failure so its really important that people learn that failures will happen and have a constructive plan to deal with them
3531809 really driven people go forward and correct that error it might mean retaking and spending 12 months righting a wrong
3531810 you have to understand what you did and the processes that led to the failure with athletes its a case of analysing their performance and working out what went wrong and going back and rectifying it in another performance to succeed
3531811 taking an exam is exactly the same process of working out how the failure occurred and what was in your control and what was outside it what you can control to be more successful in future
3531812 its difficult but worth the effort to be disciplined and determined
3531813 what you learn from failure can be as valuable as success
3531814 parental expectation can be extremely high but students need to stay focussed on their own needs to succeed
3531815 thats not to say that a support network cant be extremely valuable in times of crisis its vital that young people dont isolate themselves when they feel deflated
3531816 the most important thing to remember is not to give up you need to be realistic and understand that an alternative course of action can sometimes work out for the best in the long term
3531817 we are certainly having to be a bit more careful with the values of houses we are putting on the market
3531818 vendors are having to drop their prices lately weve been embarrassed with some of the offers weve had for a house valued at 200 000 or more people are offering 50 000 less
3531819 we are just finishing houses to a certain level at the moment

3531828 my personal view is that these conditions could continue until 2010 or even 2011 these are most difficult economic circumstances we have ever seen
3531829 as we improve higher and higher each extra gain is that bit more difficult for schools to achieve that doesnt mean i dont think they can achieve that and weve got the right strategies to do so but each of those gains are harder and thats why our targets are particularly ambitious
3531830 its quite hard to step up for a lot of pupils from level four to five because they are having to engage with some of our classical authors writing in a different style of language to what they might use at home with their friends or in school
3531831 we will not comment on speculation about something that might happen some way down the line until sutherland reports nothing is going to happen
3531832 its really quiet its a lot worse than the media realise
3531833 this time people can sit on property because interest rates are low
3531834 when things are allegedly easy you get a lot of johnny come latelys who think estate agency is an easy way to make money
3531835 that course really changed my life and made me look at the world better
3531836 i stopped getting into fights and realised that i wanted to use my experience to help people in the same position i was
3531837 many people see young people as the problem but we see them as the solution
3531838 this is when you can make a difference to your life if id known about thsu before it would have stopped me going down the wrong tracks
3531839 it is clear that many students are sleepwalking into financial crisis as the credit crunch kicks in and with food and fuel costs set to rise even further we can expect more and more students to get into serious financial difficulty with many having to resort to taking out commercial loans or being bailed out by their parents
3531840 it is extremely worrying that so many students expect to receive financial support yet do not go on to claim it at the moment each university is left to administer its own bursary system and students tell us that the application process is often very confusing
3531841 instead of the system being different in every university we need a single national student support scheme so it is simpler for students to make a claim and so that support is based on what students need not where they study
3531842 lecturers have little desire to teach students who are shattered from working long hours to pay the bills or stressed because of their financial situation
3531843 it is students from poorer backgrounds that find themselves hit the hardest as they are less likely to be able to rely on financial support from their parents
3531844 although getting on the housing ladder or starting a pension will be distant dreams for the majority of generation debt the government must reject calls for higher fees and greater student debt in next years fees review
3531845 fear of debt is a real issue that concerns universities government universities schools and colleges all those involved must continue to ensure that all those who can benefit from going to university are not deterred from doing so by the prospect of debt
3531846 attitudes towards undertaking manageable debt are changing and the vast majority of students see attending university as a worthwhile investment in their future
3531847 what these surveys sometimes fail to acknowledge is the reality that if you succeed at university your employment prospects will be enhanced and you are likely to earn more over your working lifetime
3531848 graduates in the uk continue to enjoy one of the highest financial returns of any oecd country

3531856 short of that youd be setting our students up for failure and thats my concern
3531857 one of the leading causes of high school dropout is the pressure of trying to pass algebra 1 and i think now if were going to force all of them to do it in eighth grade i would expect more kids maybe to dropout
3531858 the governor is committed to making sure we have the resources necessary to be able to implement having the highest algebra standards in the world
3531859 googles acquisition of begun is likely to significantly alter the advertising channel allowing google to enhance monetisation of its already significant 35 share of the
3531860 although google does not disclose information about its russian operations industry sources estimate that it had approximately 5 revenue share in 2006 and 2007 implying a search monetisation 4 7 times lower than that of yandex this appears to be caused by googles inability thus far to adjust to peculiarities of the russian payment system i e cash direct money transfer etc rather than cheques as well as the lack of a direct sales force this weakness was the key underpinning and rationale for the begun transaction
3531861 overall rankings for the russian market have changed significantly over the past year with two social networking sites

3531870 virtually every part of the capital markets business is suffering at the present time
3531871 no company no matter how well managed can avoid being impacted by weaknesses in its core business
3531872 if the company is forced by regulators to bring these 3 billion in auction rate securities on its book we estimate it might have to write down roughly 350 million in auction rate securities losses
3531873 its just a great honor and i look forward to a great weekend
3531874 i just remember being in the locker room before we ever played an exhibition game and getting everyone together and just going through the first few practices
3531875 and then on top of it to lose the first game of the finals and have to win two in canada and be able to pull that out in the second game the way we did and have mike stand on his head for the second period and be able to pull it out in the third
3531876 in salt lake in 02 i think we all went in with the belief that we could do it and we would so it was a little bit disappointing not to come away with gold in the u s but we played well and we did a lot of things we set out to do as a team and in that one game with came up short it might be a little disappointing but im certainly proud of that silver medal that i have at home

3531879 we have hundreds of circulators working statewide each day and every single employee is provided extensive training on their task and what they can and cannot say if anyone has any actual evidence that something was said incorrectly we ask that the circulators name be obtained and we will take swift action to investigate and remove the employee if necessary

3531905 that s kind of the finishing unit for gas at the plant it s kind of like running a doughnut factory without a deep fryer we just can t produce product right now
3531906 our customers will likely notice some of our sites will run out of gasoline temporarily gasoline is still being delivered but there will be for petro canada customers an inconvenience factor
3531907 the gasoline will be available at other petro canada sites it just might not be available where you normally fill up
3531908 it s really strange we live in a land where we produce a lot of oil
3531909 i have to look around for gas or else i walk to work
3531910 we cannot do anything because it s petro canada s decision
3531911 their refining margins would because of excess supply so there s no incentive at all for them to do that
3531912 if i was an oil company i would like to know in 10 years when i m going to have this refinery built what the eventual specs are going to be and what the emission standards are going to be
3531913 we d rather just be putting gasoline in the ground and letting our customers fill up their tanks but we re in a situation where we don t have the volume of gasoline that we normally do
3531914 we re getting our hands on any trucks we can to source product internationally and locally

3531943 mr president nigerians have spoken with a loud and clear voice and we have listened carefully to what they had to say
3531944 nigerians have expressed serious concern over the steady growth of electoral fraud in the country which has been compounded by electoral violence they have noted that the capacity of states and its regulatory framework to sanction electoral fraud has been declining steadily resulting in a growing culture of impunity they have wondered why there has historically been a lack of political will to deal with the problems of electoral fraud and election related violence they have expressed deep frustration over the lack of credibility of the electoral process and their inability to elect leaders of their choice
3531945 placed high premium on listening to and being guided by the voice of the people this was the reason why the committee adopted a number of complementary methodological approaches all geared towards obtaining maximum inputs from stakeholders and members of the public
3531946 its sort of edgy territory but we felt that as long as the focus was on the actors who were trying to do something to be taken seriously thats going too far or wrong that was where the humor would come from the joke is on actors reaching for roles in terms of hopefully winning awards

3531981 will provide clarity and certainty to the consultation process under the endangered species act
3531982 i am deeply troubled by this proposed rule which gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3531983 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government this is not the type of legacy this interior department should be leaving for future generations
3531984 clearly thats a case of asking the fox to guard the chicken coop
3531985 a giant caution light that made federal agencies stop and think about the impacts of their actions
3531986 what the bush administration is telling those agencies is they dont have to think about those impacts anymore
3531987 we have to have the ability to put our efforts where theyre needed
3531988 this really says to the agencies this law belongs to all of us
3531989 because it is not possible to link the emissions to impacts on specific listed species such as polar bears
3531990 so we dont inadvertently have the endangered species act seen as a back door to climate change policy that was never ever intended

3532003 in retrospect i dont know how sincere he was about it
3532004 i dont talk about these tabloids and these tabloid trash
3532005 i know its not possible that this child could be mine because of the timing of events

3532023 youre not gonna say and into a dry martini are you
3532024 oh no he had many friends on the ship he told me so in his letters
3532025 ncis is always welcome aboard sir you can expect excellent cooperation
3532026 you get used to it they either stonewall or kiss ass to them were the internal affairs of the navy
3532027 computers run the weapons systems the radar the sonar were the backbone of the ship here agent dinozzo
3532028 i trained at mit macdonald was a year out of high school
3532029 the best it guy in our office is 22 harvard when he gets stuck he calls his 14 year old nephew
3532030 he was having a hard time adjusting to ship life
3532031 it was obvious that seaman macdonald was disturbed but i wasnt qualified maam
3532032 all i know is that he had this mysterious friend i mean he was from here but he wasnt here it didnt make any sense but he seemed obsessed with him
3532033 a dead kid wearing dress whites for no reason with a sword he shouldnt have on which is not supposed to be sharp at the bottom of the ocean with weights on
3532034 he was a brilliant but troubled computer tech who lived at work and had a mysterious friend
3532035 okay so given the circumstances probably not an accidental death so suicide or murder
3532036 its comforting to know that macdonalds computer skills were being put to good use on a 1 billon ship
3532037 he was working on combat it was just more like the medieval kind
3532038 once in a while you might miss im on it
3532039 his fingers grabbed whatever he was touching when he succumbed
3532040 the fittings guard and pommel are 24 carat gold plated
3532041 as late as the 1800s a sword like this would have been used to defend against an enemy trying to board a ship
3532042 only the blade would have been sharp enough to take a mans limb off
3532043 of course today it wouldnt stand much of a chance against a 9 mill h and k mp5 parabellum would it
3532044 but we think he was involved in an online fantasy game
3532045 a step further and staged real fights with someone on board
3532046 who would have thought that pong would turn into online role playing games
3532047 macdonald and kinvaras were starting to take their game very seriously
3532048 its called being thorough hunches do not hold up in court
3532049 this ship has 323 enlisted 32 officers youre lucky this isnt an aircraft carrier
3532050 cut his arm on a plate glass window last month only there were no glass shards in the wound
3532051 well for starters theres a little matter of misappropriation of government property
3532052 they dont give you guys top notch equipment so you can have a better gaming experience
3532053 they wouldnt have top notch equipment if it werent for guys like me
3532054 okay what came first the online chicken or the cic egg
3532055 as whacked out as his rival tell gibbs to watch his neck
3532056 kinvaras is never frightened and ive never quite known what weylin was thinking
3532057 the afterlife could be a vast improvement for a young man so troubled
3532058 macdonald seems resolved to continue his battle with kinvaras after he leaves the ship
3532059 so why would a man so intent on his mission no matter how deranged off himself and end it
3532060 macdonald says that after he makes his escape hell destroy his enemies by releasing a great plague against the realm as the sun sets beneath the next full moon
3532061 macdonald was convinced that the crew was aiding his enemy
3532062 you listen to me very closely theres a good chance that a bio bomb is going off on this ship by sunset right now youre the best shot weve got to find it you give me answers or i will make sure youre the last one in line on the evac
3532063 did macdonald even hint in any way of taking out this crew
3532064 do you want the crew of this ship to die
3532065 i told him to take his sword and swim to shore
3532066 why was he wearing weights if he was gonna swim
3532067 he told him that was the only way he could prove to zuger he was immortal
3532068 this stuff macdonald said about cutting off the head so the body will die i mean were assuming that is part of setting up a plague against the realm but what if it meant two separate things
3532069 zugers website and his character were destroyed and the plague against the realm could simply be referring to a computer virus
3532070 i see youve still got diarrhea of the mouth david
3532071 they want to hear more your diarrhea is still new and interesting to them
3532072 do any of you know him his name is gyuho otsuji
3532073 hes the one who was arrested for having lsd in tokyo isnt he
3532074 it was on the front page of every newspaper in japan
3532075 yeah i have a friend who was there he said that he went to a party and all of a sudden the whole house was full of police and that the most interesting thing was that the cops all took their shoes off before entering the house gyuho said that someone who was mad at him tipped off the cops he only ended up getting a suspended sentence a minor miracle i understand
3532076 he wore his robes to court which established him as a pillar of society other monks came in robes to lend him support so there were he and his friends and the judge all in robes and the judge asked him if he had anything to say before sentencing and gyuho said that whereas it was wrong for the average person to experiment with dangerous drugs such as lsd that it might be okay for an esteemed person like the judge who must be better informed than the general public or a meditator who plummets the depths of the mind gyuho said that he had done it as a monk a pioneer on the fringes of consciousness he said that being a monk and sitting zazen drove some people crazy too and that it was just an extension of an already dangerous quest
3532077 yes but he also said that he now knew that he was wrong to try artificial methods and that he would never touch drugs again the judge said that he would have sent him to jail if he hadnt explained himself so well
3532078 oh you know japanese they pretended it never happened they dont like to bust big shots here the judge even pretended the whole thing was over lsd when id been arrested with marijuana and cocaine as well there was a lot of overlooking going on
3532079 yep he said that he stayed there for a couple of years more and then one day he just walked out he decided to reject the glory and the duty and become a regular person his wife an american woman the same one from the pictures had to run the temple for a year by herself which makes her one of the only non japanese ever to be in charge of a temple in japan certainly the only lay woman foreigner to do so i ran into her in america just before i left the bay area and she gave me gyuhos address he does shiatsu in fukuoka now and he has a lot of interesting friends who he sits up with late at night talking
3532080 he doesnt do that anymore but he and his girlfriend took me to a shingon priest a lady who led us to a waterfall where we put on white robes and stood in gassho beneath a hammering cold waterfall for an hour
3532081 yes when he saw me off at the train station he said that i should send all of my bags ahead like everyone else i said it was too expensive and he said this is japan japanese people are not afraid to spend money the money will come do it i just sent the heaviest one if id listened to him my back wouldnt be hurting thats what i learned from gyuho
3532082 to look around and visit some people friends and friends of friends priests artists maybe look for a teacher and i gotta find a place to live
3532083 i have many friends to look up ill hitchhike if i have to
3532084 are you serious japan isnt dangerous at all the foreigners ive talked to say its one of the easiest countries in the world to hitchhike in
3532085 it means tomorrow will take care of itself he means its the way you live
3532086 kids today have been given everything they want and dont have to work for it they have no respect for authority
3532087 theyll make remarks right to the face of the mall cops i get to the point where i want to do something
3532088 but the police say we cant that we just have to stand there
3532089 the older people just dont see obama in these glowing terms
3532090 for older voters a lot of the reservations really have to do with this experience factor while younger voters see in obama something much closer to themselves
3532091 kids want to think for themselves they dont care what mom and dad say
3532092 this was a republican stronghold but its changing very quickly because its mom and dad youre republican so i aint ever going to be one of them
3532093 even though in halo 3 you finished the fight it doesnt necessarily mean the rides over
3532094 i know his grandmother lives in hawaii and i know hawaii is a state but it has the look of him going off to some foreign exotic place he should be in myrtle beach
3532095 barotex enables our design team to create some of the strongest and most durable automotive components ever produced
3532096 for the natalia sls 2 barotex will be formed into various body panels and our revolutionary d tek chassis where its high strength will add significantly to the automobiles torsional rigidity yet our chassis will be more than a thousand pounds lighter than the conventional steel chassis found on other luxury automobiles of similar size
3532097 in contrast carbon fiber products are petroleum based and we know about the challenges that involves
3532098 not only is lava rock more abundant but our manufacturing process requires far less energy it is friendly to the environment and the automobiles built with barotex are lighter so they use less energy every mile traveled
3532099 we recently received our patent for the proprietary process used to produce barotex
3532100 we are delighted that the first production automobile to integrate this technology will be dimoras natalia sls 2 which abounds with technological breakthroughs from bumper to bumper
3532101 when we began designing our 16 cylinder engine that would erupt with 1200 horsepower we decided to call it the volcano v16 its only natural that we now surround the dimora volcano with volcanic rock from barotex
3532102 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand
3532103 and if they think also that somehow its all going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
3532104 if they think this is the way to go we will end up with millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness then you count me out i think it will be an absolute disaster
3532105 what we want to do though is refurbish the hubble so that it can operate as long as possible
3532106 were going to add some new instruments and then were going to go in and kind of do internal surgery on some instruments that are already in the telescope
3532107 the whole concept of going somewhere where you dont have a place to shelter like the space station was a little different
3532108 its a very low probability of an event but im glad that theres a relatively robust plan to deal with it if it did happen
3532109 it has answered just so many of those fundamental questions that people have been asking about the cosmos since people were able to ask questions
3532110 i hope the british board of film classification will view this with concern and decide it should not be granted a classification
3532111 without that it cannot be marketed in britain what the rest of the world does is up to them we need to ensure that modern and civilized values take priority rather than killing and maiming people
3532112 it seems a shame that the games manufacturer have decided to exclusively release this game on the wii
3532113 i believe it will spoil the family fun image of the wii
3532114 this game shouldnt be sold even to adults it wallows in violence for violences sake
3532115 i think its kind of funny then i think its kind of sad the game in which youre maiming is the baddest of the bad madworld
3532116 after talking it over with robin pemberton and brian france we came to the decision to have kyle busch race without tires kyle informed us that he was okay with the decision and that it would just create a new challenge for him and his race team we knew there was no way to take away from his ability so we took away his tires
3532117 nascar is only making kyles car lighter which gives him a weight advantage not to mention he will have quicker pit stops than everyone else because he will only have to fill the car with gas
3532118 dont do it for the money do it because you love it
3532119 would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030
3532120 a significant portion of the additional resource would not be economically attractive to develop
3532121 the asas decision to uphold wwfs complaint sends a strong signal to business and industry that greenwash is unacceptable
3532122 we considered that although emissions might be reduced on a per barrel basis the increased production of the refinery by 325 000 barrels per day would increase the total overall emissions from the port arthur refinery

3532131 he would like to explain a little georgian history old nation absorbed into ussr independent after cold war plagued by corruption then rose revolution president us educated
3532132 intimidating and laying marker for others in near abroad like ukraine pipeline etc then get into his recommendations
3532133 i think the fear is that somehow large corporations will censor their content their points of view right
3532134 i think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy which by the way would have a big first amendment problem
3532135 then whoever is in charge of government is going to determine what is fair under a so called fairness doctrine which wont be called that itll be called something else
3532136 so will web sites will bloggers have to give equal time or equal space on their web site to opposing views rather than letting the marketplace of ideas determine that
3532137 theres going to be an i 9 11 event which doesnt mean an al qaeda event what it means is an event where the instability the insecurity of the internet becomes manifest some major malicious event which then inspires the government into a response
3532138 i had dinner once with richard clark at the table and i said is there an equivalent to the patriot act an ipatriot act just sitting waiting for some substantial event just waiting for them to come have the excuse for radically changing the way the internet works
3532139 what you support people who write blogs that dont like the almighty federal government you commie
3532140 i think what was truly depressing about my time in ukadcu was that the overwhelming majority of professionals i met including those from the police the health service government and voluntary sectors held the same view the illegality of drugs causes far more problems for society and the individual than it solves yet publicly all those intelligent knowledgeable people were forced to repeat the nonsensical mantra that the government would be tough on drugs even though they all knew that the governments policy was actually causing harm
3532141 it is unfortunate that the consultation papers key facts and evidence section appears to focus on trying to convince the reader of success and progress rather than providing an objective review and presentation of the current evidence the acmd found the consultation paper self congratulatory and generally disappointing
3532142 i find that when presented with the facts the students i teach are quite capable of considering issues such as this and reaching rational conclusions even if they started with a blind daily mailesque approach i find it a shame that no mainstream political party accords the electorate the same respect
3532143 through the personal stories of several men women and children whose lives are impacted by the stolen child black market in china
3532144 the chinese government doesnt want the outside world to know about the crisis facing chinas children so this film had to be made entirely undercover the film crew posed as tourists moved hotels every three days and changed sim cards after every phone call
3532145 how can we enhance the experience to justify the ticket price increase
3532146 what they were able to do is take out a small conventional force like georgia
3532147 the russian military pretty much went into free fall in the early 1990s
3532148 the russian incursion into georgian territory and the air campaign against georgian military targets show a confident russian military
3532149 clearly the russian military is still capable of launching complex combined arms operations
3532150 if were talking about a theaterwide war in europe it would be a very different picture
3532151 a military confrontation with russia would be unlike a confrontation with any other country because they still have a superpower sized nuclear arsenal
3532152 we have enough money to pay all the states obligations through the month of september and into october

3532158 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
3532159 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
3532160 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
3532161 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
3532162 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
3532163 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
3532164 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
3532165 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
3532166 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
3532167 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
3532168 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
3532169 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
3532170 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
3532171 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
3532172 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3532173 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3532174 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3532175 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3532176 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
3532177 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
3532178 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3532179 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3532180 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3532181 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3532182 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3532183 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3532184 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos

3532187 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
3532188 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
3532189 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
3532190 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables

3532192 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
3532193 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

3532197 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
3532198 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
3532199 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
3532200 a flat belly is about food amp attitude not a single crunch required

3532211 we have to adapt to the environmental changes that have already taken place or that we can reasonably expect will occur because of climate change
3532212 the city was built with an assumption of an environmental baseline and climate change in many ways changes that baseline
3532213 some of these transformations can potentially be catastrophic as large storms others might be more subtle and difficult to discern over the short term
3532214 if it werent for the savings that we have netted from energy management and the four day workweek we would not have been able to do several of the vital things that are going to help us attract and retain even more students
3532215 it was a great thing for me because i became a full time faculty
3532216 the fact that i have that day that one day its just so much nicer and i just dont have to drive all that way to cocoa

3532223 all we need to do now is to stop suffering stop the death of people
3532224 there are bigger problems relating to south ossetia that we cannot resolve here
3532225 territorial integrity can be demonstrated by the actual facts on the ground
3532226 i think that these are some very good principles in order to resolve the problem which has arisen from this very dramatic situation and these principles can be used by georgia and south ossetia
3532227 if russia had a different option of reacting to georgias aggression against south ossetia we would have used it
3532228 but we didnt have this option when several thousand civilians are killed the state must act accordingly
3532229 i wanted to make very clear that the united states stands for the territorial integrity of georgia for the sovereignty of georgia that we support its democratically elected government and people and are reviewing options for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to georgia but the most important thing right now is that these military operations need to stop

3532254 our results suggest that adeno associated virus type 2 which infects the majority of the population but has no known ill effects kills multiple types of cancer cells yet has no effect on healthy cells
3532255 we believe that aav 2 recognizes that the cancer cells are abnormal and destroys them this suggests that aav 2 has great potential to be developed as an anti cancer agent
3532256 one of the most compelling findings is that aav 2 appears to have no pathologic effects on healthy cells
3532257 so many cancer therapies are as poisonous to healthy cells as they are to cancer cells a therapy that is able to distinguish between healthy and cancer cells could be less difficult to endure for those with cancer
3532258 the cause of cancer is clear poor diet lifestyle and poor mental attitude result in toxic buildup which overloads the self cleansing mechanism cancer is manifestation of long term nutritional and environmental irritation resulting in cellular oxygen starvation leading to uncontrolled cell replication it is often triggered by psychological causes inducing immune system collapse

3532262 we found no overall increased risk of brain tumors among cellular phone users the potential elevated risk of brain tumors after long term cellular phone use awaits confirmation by future studies
3532263 if there is a risk from these products and at this point we do not know that there is it is probably very small
3532264 growing body of literature linking long term cell phone use to possible adverse health effects including cancer
3532265 although the evidence is still controversial i am convinced that there are sufficient data to warrant issuing an advisory to share some precautionary advice on cell phone use
3532266 the question is do you want to play russian roulette with your brain

3532269 we certainly dont know of any mechanism by which radiofrequency exposure would cause a cancerous effect in cells we just dont know this might possibly occur
3532270 by all means if a person feels compelled that they should take precautions in reducing the amount of electromagnetic radio waves through their bodies by all means they should do so
3532271 but at the same time we have to remember theres no conclusive evidence that links cell phones to cancer whether its brain tumors or other forms of cancer
3532272 when you look at the overwhelming majority of studies that have been peer reviewed and published in scientific journals around the world youll find no relationship between wireless usage and adverse health affects

3532358 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
3532359 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3532360 lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in terms of voice yang peiyi is perfect each member of our team agreed
3532361 he told us there was a problem that we needed to fix it so we did
3532362 rather than delivering a slightly relevant message to a persons mailbox rss allows us to get customers very detailed information directly
3532363 is a way to basically position highly relevant microsites in front of consumers
3532364 those are things id never discuss in the media how we rate these guys or grade them or decide thats just not something to talk about its just not something i discuss it doesnt do anybody any good id never do that
3532365 hes a little more relaxed and comfortable in the system the other guys will come around in short order im sure were just trying to get him osullivan caught up rep wise with the other guys really and see where he goes with it you cant choreograph this they take you where youre going hes done a pretty good job
3532366 its pretty easy when you think about isnt it now caught up in terms of practice he can know the entire offense but if he doesnt practice you cant expect him play in a game
3532367 yeah those types of issues are coaching oriented you can deal with that its a matter of playing the game and managing the game his biggest issue is getting acclimated and actually playing which is probably where shaun hill is because he hasnt played a whole lot each guy presents a different set of issues for you good and bad and you just try to help them as much as you can
3532368 whoever we go with is the quarterback we feel we have the best chance to win with period theres no projecting this or who can help us later
3532369 i just like his toughness and aggressive approach to the game hes extremely competitive and the energy he brings to the game can uplift the team the energy he brought was pretty significant id never been around that kind of energy before at that position so he was pretty unique
3532370 it would be one thing if people hes competing with at that position were established

3532375 if you want me to vacuum youve got to get up
3532376 its as if the universe has a sense of humor since at a deep level its impossible not to lead a spiritual life you and i are as deeply engaged in making a world as a saint you cant be fired from the job of creating a world which is the essence of spirituality and you cant resign from the job even when you refuse to show up the universe is living through you at this moment with or without belief in god the chain of events leading from silent awareness to physical reality remains intact the operating system of the universe applies to everyone alike and it works along principles that do not require your cooperation however if you do decide to lead a consciously spiritual life a change occurs the principles of the operating system which means the rules of creation become personal
3532377 1 the universe is a mirror of consciousness 1 the events in your life reflect who you are 2 awareness is collective we all draw it from a common place 2 the people in your life reflect aspects of yourself 3 awareness expands within itself 3 whatever you pay attention to will grow 4 consciousness creates by design 4 nothing is random your life is full of signs and symbols

3532380 i think the fear is that somehow large corporations will censor their content their points of view right
3532381 i think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy which by the way would have a big first amendment problem
3532382 then whoever is in charge of government is going to determine what is fair under a so called fairness doctrine which wont be called that itll be called something else
3532383 so will web sites will bloggers have to give equal time or equal space on their web site to opposing views rather than letting the marketplace of ideas determine that
3532384 the fairness doctrine has not been raised at the fcc but the importance of this election is in part has something to do with that
3532385 so you know this election if it goes one way we could see a re imposition of the fairness doctrine there is a discussion of it in congress i think it wont be called the fairness doctrine by folks who are promoting it i think it will be called something else and i think itll be intertwined into the net neutrality debate
3532386 whenever were afraid its because we dont know enough if we understood enough we would never be afraid

3532391 dnssec is signed with a cryptographic key which is great for example com gives the signing key for co uk the question is who establishes the chain of trust the american government thinks it should but the chinese government disagrees
3532392 dnssec does provide security but people havent worked out the administration

3532413 studies are showing that the addition of fluoride to municipal water supplies is having little effect on oral health
3532414 instead the recent studies provide mounting evidence that fluoride can adversely affect the neurological development of children

3532416 has been controlled for far too long by the dental lobby
3532417 theyre preoccupied by one tissue the teeth whereas the opponents of fluoridation like myself see the body slightly differently
3532418 i believe health canada is not giving the citizens the truth on this issue
3532419 no studies have investigated a possible relationship between fluoridated water and lower iqs in children arthritic symptoms in adults underactive thyroid glands increased bone fractures in children and earlier onset of puberty
3532420 the science has not been done in canada if you dont look you dont find
3532421 i think there is a very strong case for the precautionary removal of this mass medication from our drinking water
3532422 there are studies which show changes in iq from populations exposed to fluoride in drinking water the thing is if you look at an individual you never really know that they may have been five points higher on the iq scale
3532423 we rely on science and expert reports from around the world
3532424 so while we at the cda have not ourselves conducted research on the

3532427 if this is what is required of me then i will choose death over life

3532430 the premeditated slaying of john lennon with an essentially clear mind
3532431 your conduct thus precipitated a horrendously tragic event which has impacted many individuals

3532435 we are a long way short of establishing a motive for this crime and we are a long way short of arresting anyone

3532448 time it was and what a time it was it was
3532449 it was nice to get in that situation where in a game situation we were able to give him that kick
3532450 its kind of a neat little collection of people training together
3532451 they look at your kicking motion and figures out which muscles in your body you really need to work i hope to do this for a long time so i try to keep it fresh and reevaluate things from year to year i really think it paid off for me to go there and pinpoint areas i needed to work on
3532452 not being able to practice was a big thing and having the fracture hindered me physically
3532453 its part of the deal i was able to kick or i wouldnt have been out there doing it i just kind of fought through it and was able to practice before the new england game which worked out well
3532454 im taking two fewer steps in my approach to allow myself to have a little bit better rhythm a little bit more consistent ball contact
3532455 i feel like im hitting the ball as well and as consistent as i ever have were doing a lot with our kickoff coverage in terms of directionally kicking and things that im excited about im trying to place the ball
3532456 norv has been really good to me and hes really worked with me
3532457 kicking is probably as unique of a position as you can find in all of team sports you practice all week and then end up kicking only two or three field goals in the span of three hours
3532458 weve tried to simulate how a game would actually go
3532459 in a two hour practice instead of going out and kicking 10 field goals in a row well do four with 10 or 15 minutes in between each kick thats been really helpful trying to simulate the game as much as possible
3532460 i feel strong and as confident as ive ever felt
3532461 i feel like ive been in about every situation possible now so i feel like i can handle anything thats thrown at me this season

3532467 the 3g coverage of t mobile is as good as the competition there can therefore not lie we suspect that it is a hardware software specific issue of the iphone itself

3532469 we believe this is the first project of its kind that pairs homeowners with volunteer attorneys before the foreclosure is started in an effort to hold back the flood of foreclosures
3532470 cfo alex sink asked for the help of the florida bar to address the avalanche of foreclosures facing florida homeowners the real property probate and trust law section is pleased to have the opportunity to assist with the coordination of the efforts of volunteer attorneys in this task we hope to help individual owners and their families find a way to keep their homes
3532471 the concept for the project began with the announcement from the banking industry of their hope now and project lifeline projects
3532472 we felt homeowners having trouble with their mortgage would have better success negotiating with their lender if they had the assistance of an attorney

3532490 from the moment of conception this being is alive it is not dead in fact the more science knows about fetal development the more science has confirmed that the beginning of any one human life biologically speaking begins at the union of his fathers sperm and his mothers ovum a process called conception we have failed to communicate to the nation and we have failed america in my judgment we have not had the moral courage to stand up and say that the expense of ignoring the truth is death misery human degradation and the loss of opportunity and dignity for millions of humans what kind of society is it that dismisses the silent screams of 1 2 million abortions performed this year as matters of privacy
3532491 abortion ends more black lives than heart disease cancer accidents aids and violent crime combined african americans constitute little more than 12 percent of the population but have more than a third 37 percent of abortions that rate has held relatively constant though in some regions the numbers are much starker in mississippi black women receive some 72 percent of all abortions according to the centers for disease control nationwide 512 out of every 1 000 black pregnancies end in an abortion revealingly enough roughly 80 percent of planned parenthoods abortion centers are in or near minority communities

3532495 from the moment of conception this being is alive it is not dead in fact the more science knows about fetal development the more science has confirmed that the beginning of any one human life biologically speaking begins at the union of his fathers sperm and his mothers ovum a process called conception we have failed to communicate to the nation and we have failed america in my judgment we have not had the moral courage to stand up and say that the expense of ignoring the truth is death misery human degradation and the loss of opportunity and dignity for millions of humans what kind of society is it that dismisses the silent screams of 1 2 million abortions performed this year as matters of privacy
3532496 abortion ends more black lives than heart disease cancer accidents aids and violent crime combined african americans constitute little more than 12 percent of the population but have more than a third 37 percent of abortions that rate has held relatively constant though in some regions the numbers are much starker in mississippi black women receive some 72 percent of all abortions according to the centers for disease control nationwide 512 out of every 1 000 black pregnancies end in an abortion revealingly enough roughly 80 percent of planned parenthoods abortion centers are in or near minority communities

3532540 as for claims by the georgian president that the ceasefire has been observed for two days thats a lie georgian forces continued to fire at peacekeepers
3532541 its strange when someone whos killed thousands of people is characterized as a terrorist and bastard while another is presented as legally elected president of a sovereign state

3532543 the air and artillery bombardment left the provincial capital without water food electricity and gas horrified civilians crawled out of the basements into the streets as fighting eased looking for supplies

3532585 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3532586 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3532587 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3532588 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3532589 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3532590 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3532591 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3532592 as a scientist im thrilled by natural selection but as a human being i abhor it as a principle for organising society
3532593 we are closer to chimpanzees than a horse is to an ass

3532595 ensure all our records are 100 per cent accurate and we have advised the civil aviation safety authority
3532596 we want to make sure that all maintenance documentation is all ok
3532597 i joined a couple of apartments together and did internal non structural refurbishment
3532598 every single person who did a refurbishment had the sign off from the executive committee of the owners corporation which was acting on best advice and in good faith
3532599 i am happy to comply with whatever rules and regulations are appropriate and anything the council now puts forward i dont think any resident would say anything to the contrary
3532600 there is a lot of anger in the building about the amount of noise and dust from the work the fact the lifts are used by builders and that the building managers and concierges spend too much time chasing after workmen to be able to do their jobs properly
3532601 major work including removing walls subdividing and consolidating apartments generally requires council consent to ensure correct safety amenity and construction processes are followed
3532602 works undertaken without first gaining council consent can be subject to fines and orders requiring the works to be rectified and can require development applications be lodged to seek consent for ongoing uses
3532603 pier 6 7 is in the walsh bay wharves precinct conservation area which is listed on the state heritage register this means that development consent for most works is also required from the heritage office
3532604 i dont have all the details but yes we have all the approvals
3532605 works have been going on for more than a year and i have had to live underneath it the whole time
3532606 bruce has been encouraging people to sell their apartments so they can be amalgamated with other apartments
3532607 wed been told there would be more amalgamations and that wed just have to cop it
3532608 all i wanted to do was find a way we could have some peace between renovations then i suppose i started asking the wrong questions
3532609 neither i nor anyone else at dynamic wishes to remove the chair of pier 6 7 we have no reason to want to do so and my actions are totally motivated by compliance with the law and the best interests of the scheme
3532610 even if the same person owns apartments on both sides of a common property wall that wall is still common property
3532611 i do apologise to you for my 2003 letter which was poorly drafted and i regret open to interpretations which i did not intend
3532612 i expected an apology in which he admitted he got the whole thing wrong until that happens there will be no peace
3532613 the matter is not concluded yet and it is a lot better to try to make progress on these issues at a personal level rather than through the press
3532614 weve looked at these issues and we have the same rights as other citizens and will continue to exercise them legally and well
3532615 estas personas tienen la gran habilidad de meter la mano en los bolsillos de la gente sin que se den cuenta esto ha generado que todo el que viene a comprar ac venga totalmente prevenido
3532616 la infraestructura del parque es muy linda pero lo que pasa all no la polic a pasa espor dicamente por la zona y cuando lo hacen son algunos lustrabotas los encargados de guardarles las cosas robadas o la droga
3532617 vamos entonces a realizar una reuni n de buenos vecinos y los vamos a escuchar as como hacemos cada semana en las localidades
3532618 we have done some work on the potential impact on premiums
3532619 id have to say its nowhere near the 5 range that a number of people have talked about probably less than half that
3532620 we both agree with private health insurers that the effect of this will be of the order of 5 on premiums there will be a 10 increase in premiums but 5 of that was going to happen anyway
3532621 the reason for that is although i support the principle of giving consumers better information fuelwatch will have the unintended consequence of squeezing out independents
3532622 the benefits are unclear the government hasnt released any modelling to show whether there would be benefits
3532623 under fuelwatch they have to set their prices for 24 hours if they make a bad call they cop it and lose sales
3532624 if you are an independent with just one or two or three outlets your ability to manage that risk is much more limited than coles or woolworths who have hundreds of outlets
3532625 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3532626 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3532627 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3532628 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3532629 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3532630 are you better off than you were four years ago
3532631 weve got to cap this government entitlements like medicaid you know there are just too many poor and disabled and elderly people who need health care those pesky people that need health care laughter weve got to control those government entitlements
3532632 oh lets make sure andy blunt has an ethanol plant oh lets give him a tax credit
3532633 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3532634 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3532635 the business of theology is to make sure that our questions to the scriptures of any religious tradition will be directed in such a way as to allow ourselves to be challenged and even shaken at the deepest levels of our existence by what the text says the mini study about the gospel of judas for you will sacrifice the man that clothes me
3532636 american evangelicals are not exemplary for their thinking and they have not been so for several generations evangelicalism has little intellectual muscle
3532637 by an evangelical life of the mind i mean more the effort to think like a christian to think within a specifically christian framework across the whole spectrum of modern learning including economics and political science literary criticism and imaginative writing historical inquiry and philosophical studies linguistics and the history of science social theory and the arts
3532638 well to be perfectly academically honest we must push the limits of our understanding
3532639 the business of theology is to make sure that our questions to the scriptures of any religious tradition will be directed in such a way as to allow ourselves to be challenged and even shaken at the deepest levels of our existence by what the text says
3532640 all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying
3532641 right division have no trouble in reconciling these discrepancies while others may have to work a wee bit to put theses discrepancies
3532642 i think its very clear that russian ambitions are to restore the old
3532643 you have to be clearheaded about that kind of regime
3532644 explaining with precision what we dont like about their behavior rather than saying he looked into putins eyes and saw kgb that has an adolescent quality that gets us exactly nowhere
3532645 speaking directly to the russians as opposed to in some pugnacious cold war fashion is what this modern challenge needs
3532646 what russia needs to know is that it will be globally ostracized and s global approach is different from the state to state balance of power approach that is visible in the mccain talking points
3532647 he was a reaganite in the cold war that was a pro democracy anti communist approach
3532648 he was certainly supportive of yeltsin from the early 90s through the mid 90s
3532649 we should make clear to russia that we appreciate the importance of russian stability to our own security
3532650 but we should make equally clear to russia that we are free to pursue all opportunities for enhancing our security and that of our allies
3532651 w e must make abundantly clear to moscow that we consider this action to be evidence that russia cannot yet be trusted as good faith partners in preserving european stability
3532652 when putin emerged as this highly capable strongman with kgb networks i suspect that turned mccain off
3532653 a country that increasingly appears to have more in common with its soviet and czarist predecessors than with the modern state claims to aspire to build
3532654 determination of whether a particular statement constitutes a dying declaration is whether the courts findings are palpably contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence
3532655 for years fema resisted acknowledging the problem or seeking funds for remediation
3532656 we are committed to upholding our obligations to remediate remove or upgrade them as necessary
3532657 we believe in adhering to any relevant environmental rule or law and will do so

3532680 on the night he was betrayed and even though the betrayer of jesus is not mentioned is noticeable that paul knew about the incident

3532684 lords supper is all about and how if we can it came to be a divisive issue that it is today
3532685 now the of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to jesus saying unto him where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover the first day the eating of the passover took place on the 14
3532686 now when the even was come he sat down with the twelve
3532687 another indication that this meal was not the passover as the passover was eaten standing see ex 12 11

3532694 neither taught nor knew of anything like what these heretics rave about
3532695 the ecclesiastical tradition from the apostles and the preaching of the truth have come down to us and this is the most abundant proof that there is one and the same vivifying faith which has been preserved in the church from the apostles until now and handed down in truth

3532734 to be honest halfway in the third round i got up and walked out of the arena and went to my hotel
3532735 the fight wasnt the most exciting and i wanted to get out of there before everyone else was getting up to leave
3532736 ive asked myself a thousand times since my fight saturday why i fought demian maia on the ground and i dont have an answer for it
3532737 that wasnt the game plan we trained that if the fight goes to the ground that i would work to get into a position to get the fight back up on the feet and i just didnt do it
3532738 i dont know what went wrong in my head i dont know what happened and why i chose to fight that fight on the ground sure i made the fight exciting and ive gotten lots of positive responses on how well i did on the ground with a guy like maia but at the end of the day he caught me and thats what he does best i played into this game

3532745 they were so focused on wanting to be in the trillion dollar asset club for banks that they cut corners
3532746 help protect the unsuspecting credit card user too many people have gotten themselves deeply in debt from credit card company practices please help the uninformed from getting themselves in trouble and unable to recover from their debts
3532747 now is the time to reign in these white collar criminal like practices of the credit card companies banks and card companies blatantly display a predatory personality when it comes to their ability to think of new ways to financially rape the public in fact they should be required to repay or pay penalties for their dark side practices sincere thanks for making them toe the line
3532748 i agree that 30 days late is late one day is not late i support the 21 day period that you are proposing for issuers to mail deliver the bill to me it gives me a chance to avoid expensive late fees and maybe even a penalty interest rate
3532749 the restriction on penalty rates as applied to existing balances is the heart of the proposed rule this protection will do more than any other to return some balance and fairness to the credit card marketplace
3532750 rather than prohibiting rate increases on existing balances the final rule should permit such increases if consumers also have the ability to opt out of the increase by closing the account
3532751 if a rate increase accurately reflects the available market rates for that consumer it is rational for a consumer to accept the increase and not opt out because if they close that account the consumer may not be able to get a lower rate with another card issuer

3532772 through a series of freak occurrences a group of actors shooting a big budget war movie are forced to become the soldiers they are portraying
3532773 it was even worse than the hateful stuff they used in promoting it
3532774 an r rated comedy that satirizes hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters in ridiculous situations
3532775 its never funny when good and decent human beings are humiliated
3532776 in fact it is dangerous and disgusting this film is all that and more
3532777 i can do nothing it doesnt depend on what i do any more i dont think critics read my books
3532778 but i always go to the locations when i write a novel in this case some of the locations were so impressive that the idea for the film came from that
3532779 i enjoyed the preparation of the movie i mean the period immediately before the shooting when you choose everything all the details when you create the world i enjoyed a lot of the shooting too
3532780 bauchau has something in him that is to do with sincere spirituality
3532781 he gives the impression of someone who believes in something that is honest
3532782 few beings have ever been so impregnated pierced to the core by the conviction of the absolute futility of human aspiration
3532783 i tried but they are extremely boring i dont understand their success
3532784 the actors are good but that in my opinion was the only good thing technically it is not very good the script is not good
3532785 it is disgusting i dont like people talking about my private life
3532786 i am always looking for a compromise between a nice place and somewhere not too far from an airport
3532787 it needs personal discipline not to look at the internet
3532788 it is human temptation to read what is said about you but you have to resist
3532789 i think i will come back to writing for a while
3532790 why are people surprised that im a social worker who writes novels
3532791 if i were still in childrens services it might be different
3532792 that work can leave you emotionally exhausted but i still enjoy what i do perhaps because im now in the positive zone of social work im at the beginning of a process that is looking to provide children with the opportunity of a better future anyway
3532793 if you have an enormous amount of time on your hands you dont always get down to the business of writing
3532794 we spent most of our time with a scraper or paintbrush in our hands
3532795 but as time went on i had a nagging feeling that i was living in a bubble miles away from the real world
3532796 he died when i was 11 giving me the opportunity to feel sorry for myself as a semi orphan around that time i first read david copperfield and immediately identified with the lone child hero
3532797 it wasnt the done thing to reveal those kind of secrets in those days
3532798 people who knew about dickens and ellen ternan the mistress remained loyal to him and so did catherine after his death she bequeathed to the nation his early letters to her so the world might know that he loved me once as she put it
3532799 but im also interested in how he could behave so badly bearing in mind his sensitivity to people and his feelings for the poor and downtrodden
3532800 yes but i believe that he was a man who still valued goodness and must have been disappointed with himself i suspect that he went through all kinds of psychological convolutions to square it
3532801 well he certainly believed in practical action and the capacity of individuals to make a difference
3532802 he gave an immense amount of time to all sorts of projects including sailing clubs for boys and small hospitals in the east end of london but as a former parliamentary reporter i dont think hed have much time for systems imposed by politicians when i started in childrens services in 1969 most of my work was preventive by the time i finished in 1996 there was far more statutory child protection work when things have gone wrong there have been public inquiries with the consequence of more centrally imposed systems
3532803 but he was also very paternalistic you can tell that from the novels women are rarely strong characters in their own right unless theyre comic figures heaven knows what hed have made of modern women he once took a girl to the police station because she swore at him in the street
3532804 it was so sombre to hear hind part before isaac hayes
3532805 i am pleased with the companys second quarter results specifically sales growth during uncertain economic times and strong cash flow management

3532818 they were giving him points for anything but when i was hitting him they were not giving me points
3532819 i thought they were very generous to the chinese lad
3532820 you expect a slight bias but you come to the olympic games and you also expect a level playing field
3532821 he is strong and i think hes better than me
3532822 are you saying that obamas skin color is a metaphor for a blackness of heart
3532823 obama is of mixed ancestry he is black but he does not speak in the language of the ghetto joseph biden he is so articulate he is also partly white and he can speak of his mother from kansas he transcends race and racial identity thus he also transcends racial divisions he transcends partisan politics he transcends ideology he transcends traditional ways of doing things he is his own new paradigm he is the forerunner of a new era in america

3532826 they republican lawmakers and president george w bush have this thing that says drill offshore in the protected areas
3532827 well we can do that we can have a vote on that but it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public and not just a hoax on them
3532828 if speaker pelosi is truly sincere about having a vote on deep ocean oil and gas drilling to help bring down fuel costs she should use her power as speaker to call congress back into session immediately and schedule a vote

3532832 it may be unfair but voters view corzines plans to use the new jersey turnpike to reorganize state finances as blue smoke and mirrors

3532834 there is no score or points given by the judges on what a contestant looks like its all about public speaking talent charity work and being an all around good person

3532846 in the last 12 months the strategists have been ahead of analysts in reducing forecasts
3532847 in difficult market circumstances strategists are very useful because they can identify changes in the market when you have a prolonged period of benign environments you tend to focus on the bottom up and analysts can point you in the right direction
3532848 analysts tend to be more optimistic about the earnings outlook of individual companies generally they typically have a bias for thinking earnings will be higher than they actually are

3532866 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3532867 this was a historic campaign people thought it would be an easy march to the nomination and then an easy win in the fall and instead weve had this historic presidential election where shes collapsed and a first term senator has won the democratic nomination so i think its just the nature of the defeat has made a lot of people frustrated and theres certainly people out there who really want the kind of full story to come to light so people can understand exactly what happened
3532868 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go

3532870 while after vigorously denying reports of his extramarital affair and calling the story ridiculous untrue and tabloid trash john edwards today admitted he had an affair and the national enquirer was the only publication writing about it the national enquirer was the first to break it turns out it was true you know what this means elvis is alive bigfoot is real aliens are here its all true
3532871 well according to a new study coffee can improve your memory thats what they say drinking coffee improves your memory which is good news for both barack obama and john mccain if we can get them to have some coffee before their first debate maybe they can remember what their original positions were
3532872 of the 18 faith groups identified in the polls mccain is only leading among evangelicals and its a narrow lead obama leads among the other 17 faith groups identified including the born again vote barna notes that would mark the first time in more than two decades that the born again vote has swung toward the democratic candidate

3532874 shes one of the most popular players in the wnba i think because shes kind of a symbol that anybody can achieve anything shes 55
3532875 i think she did really good especially for the situation shes in for having to play for a different country
3532876 shes been to enough family get togethers here and many of my friends have met her and theyve all fallen in love with her and follow her all the time i get emails constantly about how is becky doing where is becky

3532880 do you realize youre the first woman in our clubhouse
3532881 i think you have better athletes nowadays better training stronger athletes
3532882 that has led to more records being broken and more 3 000 hits achieved
3532883 the paternalism has gone out of the game there is a business like attitude from the owner toward the player and this is for the good of the game
3532884 the players might look like theyre playing for themselves but they really arent
3532885 when you walk out on that field in competition its your pride at stake
3532886 pitchers used to intimidate hitters and today hitters intimidate pitchers
3532887 pitchers dont have command of the fastball inside the strike zone has gotten smaller athletes are bigger stronger with the training facilities and techniques they have today hitters are more dependent on video and scouting reports rather than their own instincts the fundamentals arent as good
3532888 but thats not always the players fault a player may want to stay with one club but the club trades them everything has evolved some are good some are bad
3532889 its definitely a business but its also a game and you have to put up with that stuff and most of us are willing to the moneys there i dont care who you are its a small motivation because you have an opportunity to be financially secure at some point if you do things the right way
3532890 im wearing my last name on the back of my jersey and im representing myself and my family and friends back home so i want to be proud and i want to play hard play the game the right way and win the respect of my teammates and have fun while im doin it
3532891 nobody wants to go out there and get beat we all have a lot of pride in what we do
3532892 i love competition i love beatin the other guy we love to compete and we love the game and i think for the most part every single guy in the big leagues is givin it his all everyday to me i dont see money ruinin the competitive side of this at all if anything it makes it better because more guys are trying to get a piece of it and they work harder and they do everything they can to be successful
3532893 a rollercoaster everybody is on the rollercoaster lots of dives lots of climbing the cardinals are on a little downturn right now its something that happens to every team every year
3532894 in the past a pitcher could be a little more intimidating because you could throw in off the plate more and if you hit a guy it wasnt a big deal
3532895 its not that pitchers are intimidated by the hitters i just think the umpires and the league have taken such drastic measures to make sure guys arent hit that the intimidation level is not the same
3532896 it may be different than it was 30 years ago but theres always distractions in baseball the guys who can stay in the big leagues are the guys who can put things aside and still perform
3532897 no matter how much money you make guys are more upset im more upset when i fail than any fan or anybody in the front office
3532898 i want to succeed and i think more players are like that
3532899 the bottom line is youre supposed to play the game as hard as you can every single day it doesnt matter what your contract status is
3532900 is a no nonsense guy he wants you to have fun but youve got to be on time and work hard and the fun will come with that this is a job do i think theres loyalty in this game yes if youre treated correctly
3532901 some of the players are stronger but still dont exactly know the game
3532902 todays game requires a player to play as a team but you also gotta get your numbers
3532903 so it is a combination but there are going to be times when you have to sacrifice for your team on our team i think you see a lot of guys doing that
3532904 obviously the pay scale is incredible now and baseball is now getting players worldwide
3532905 i think when you get to the big leagues one of the things you have to eliminate is fear or youll never stay here if youre scared at anytime i think the hitter or the pitcher can sense that in you we faced johan santana today and if you looked like you were scared in the box he knew he had you speaking for myself as soon as im scared of somebody or something i know im beat
3532906 no not me i dont think about them at all last night six hits schumaker was 6 for 9 was a fluke and i dont see that happening anytime soon
3532907 theres more talent in baseball now than in the past
3532908 there are more pitchers in the bullpen less complete games there are a lot more small ballparks
3532909 the scale has tilted theyve made it pretty much in favor of the hitter in a lot of ways they want runs
3532910 in the 90s i hate to say it the steroid era just relied on big guys hitting home runs its going in the right direction i do see pitching coming back definitely getting better which im very happy to see
3532911 theres more media particularly here there are more distractions off the field too
3532912 la russa has some interesting ideas i think his track record you cant argue with it
3532913 if youre a professional and you come to the park on time and you do your work like youre supposed to and you run out and hustle play hard the manager should just leave you alone
3532914 when someone does well they like to hear it from a manager rookie or veteran i always liked it
3532915 is what it is and its the greatest game there is and its all ive wanted to do since i was born it is still the best game there is

3532944 there are bigger problems relating to south ossetia that we cannot resolve here
3532945 territorial integrity can be demonstrated by the actual facts on the ground
3532946 i think that these are some very good principles in order to resolve the problem which has arisen from this very dramatic situation and these principles can be used by georgia and south ossetia
3532947 if russia had a different option of reacting to georgias aggression against south ossetia we would have used it
3532948 but we didnt have this option when several thousand civilians are killed the state must act accordingly
3532949 i wanted to make very clear that the united states stands for the territorial integrity of georgia for the sovereignty of georgia that we support its democratically elected government and people and are reviewing options for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to georgia but the most important thing right now is that these military operations need to stop
3532950 would not be in the best interest of the community
3532951 she was very pleased at the division of paroles decision
3532952 weve worked with russia in terms of the wto accession and they still have a ways to go so its not as though theyre close to it they still have some work to do before they get to it
3532953 we should convene other international forums to condemn this aggression to call for an immediate halt to the violence and to review multilateral and bilateral arrangements with russia including russias interest in joining the world trade organization
3532954 we are making progress on the last details of the negotiations i think it is important to finish this up
3532955 we need to be cautious with what were allowing someone to do and at what point in their recovery theyre allowed to do it

3532957 whether its pop warner football or soccer or high school teams
3532958 its difficult for them to realize this one game friday night is not as important as my cognitive ability the rest of my life
3532959 they were retreating it wasnt panic but they were trying to leave one by one not in groups
3532960 we dont have anything we dont have food we left when the shelling started with very few things
3532961 we dont know whats going on and why the russians did this to us they said they were defending ossetians who are they defending here
3532962 if the russians say theyre defending the civilian population why dont they care about kodori gorge
3532963 they dont know where theyll go we have no idea theres so much confusion
3532964 georgias ill wishers are well aware that georgia is impossible to defeat when it is united and when it has world support
3532965 small businesses that are going to be liable for a lot of income tax are likely to use other tax forms so they only pay individual income taxes
3532966 the tax system that allows this wholesale tax avoidance is an embarrassment and unfair to hardworking americans who pay their fair share of taxes
3532967 the u s corporate tax rate stayed the same while foreign countries have drifted down which increases the incentive for companies to report income in other countries
3532968 if the u s drops the rate to 30 but closes other tax loopholes that may ultimately generate more tax revenue for the government

3532978 sometimes the cause and effect is difficult to define its a self perpetuating vicious circle going on where oil falls strengthens the dollar then the strengthening dollar forces oil down more
3532979 it is past time for the russian government to immediately sign and implement a cease fire russia must halt its violation of georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia with international monitors to verify that these obligations are met
3532980 subsequent statements have been a reflection of events on the ground
3532981 theres no question the one relative strength mccain has in the polls is on national security so every chance he gets every way he gets he tries to turn the conversation in that direction
3532982 if anybody were paying attention it might help mccain marginally
3532983 who are absorbed with our own war with our own economic crisis
3532984 russian president dmitry medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term consequences
3532985 i wholeheartedly condemn the violation of georgias sovereignty i think it is important at this point for all sides to show restraint and to stop this arms conflict georgias territorial integrity needs to be preserved and now is the time for direct talks
3532986 the restraint on both sides argument is not very smart its true on one level but its not the right thing to say first
3532987 i dont think it necessarily hurts obama but i think mccain has been vindicated
3532988 this forecast reflects continuing weak gasoline margins because of the decline in gasoline consumption and growth in ethanol supply

3533003 en las ltimas semanas he sido objeto de un juicio que tuvo como sede los medios de comunicaci n y como resultado del cual he sido condenado y he sufrido una especie de lapidaci n p blica
3533004 quiero en primer lugar llamar a la reflexi n sobre esta especie de encarnizamiento medi tico que ha dado por hechos probados lo que en realidad son sorprendentes acusaciones que no han sido ni ser n probadas ya que se trata de hechos que nunca han existido
3533005 si bien es doloroso y humillante que se destruya de este modo a mi persona lo es a n m s el efecto que se ha producido en relaci n a mi trayectoria profesional y acad mica
3533006 me parece muy injusto que a ra z de esta lamentable confusi n que me involucra sea puesta en tela de juicio una producci n te rica que ha contribuido y contribuye a la comprensi n de la violencia el maltrato y el abuso de poder en nuestra sociedad y que ha servido como material de estudio en m ltiples mbitos de formaci n profesional tanto en nuestro pa s como en otros de habla hispana
3533007 yo pido que se vuelva a la racionalidad que se ha visto afectada por el discurso medi tico y que no se sigan mezclando los niveles de an lisis del problema
3533008 si la justicia cumple acabadamente con el prop sito de investigar hasta llegar a la verdad me siento ntimamente tranquilo a pesar del horror que significa estar castigado en el mismo nivel que lo est n los delincuentes a quienes se ha condenado por un delito
3533009 tengo la ntima convicci n de no haber cometido delito alguno en toda mi vida
3533010 agradezco a la enorme cantidad de personas que me hacen llegar su apoyo y su solidaridad precisamente porque saben que yo ser a incapaz de ninguna de esa serie de barbaridades de las que se me acusa as lo demuestra la inexistencia de una sola prueba en mi contra en todo el expediente
3533011 solamente se han detenido a acumular evidencias sobre aspectos de mi vida privada que deber an estar resguardados por el derecho a la intimidad que me asiste y que no configuran delito alguno

3533063 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3533064 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3533065 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3533066 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

3533068 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3533069 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3533070 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3533071 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3533072 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3533073 let me join peter in affirming taiwan is not a part of the prc you can sit your ass down in front of the presidential office for days and demand that he step down and you wont be shot
3533074 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3533075 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3533077 she didnt sleep at all last night it just came out of nowhere and she spent most of the night in the bathroom we think its food poisoning but were not sure
3533078 if she comes out of this okay shes in pretty good position to be formidable in the 10k
3533079 i was hoping it would be a fast race because shes in great shape but i dont know what shes capable of doing because of last night
3533080 if things were neutral and fine and if somebody cranks it up she would go with them if its a slow race i dont think she can kick with the ethiopians but i dont think they can run her off the field unless shes sick
3533081 we decided to respect the decision by the association taking into account that the recovery of her injury is not going well
3533082 to send a firm signal of the iocs moral consideration that this case has brought the olympic movement very much into disrepute
3533083 this was the last act of a pre arranged decision a planned effort to stop me from competing and winning a medal for my country
3533084 this is an illegal decision that goes against any concept of equality equity and legality in the civilized world it is these totalitarian practices and decisions that bring the sporting spirit and the olympic ideal that my country gave birth to into disrepute

3533096 several bothersome headlines related to major financial firms have tempered some of the bullish enthusiasm
3533097 in particular jpmorgan chase said it has incurred roughly us1 5 billion in losses so far this quarter as trading conditions have deteriorated substantially
3533098 with economic indicators showing a greater likelihood of recession we anticipate lower earnings through early 2009 due to further credit weakness in housing and investor real estate as well as some decline in the retail and consumer sectors
3533099 uncertainty and volatility in global credit markets will continue to place upward pressure on funding costs
3533100 we are cautious going into the new financial year and the group will continue with its conservative stance until signs of improvements in economic conditions are evident
3533101 the groups capital position is strong with capital levels well above target ranges
3533102 while these broad trends are clearly evident the duration and extent of the slowdown is more difficult to predict
3533103 there are clearly a number of negatives at work in the australian economy but it is important that we recognise there are potentially a number of positive influences
3533104 the balance of these opposing forces favours continued modest economic growth with credit growth not too far below the average of the past decade
3533105 while it is clearly a time to be cautious the current environment presents well managed banks like the commonwealth bank of australia with opportunities to grow even stronger
3533106 our robust financial position has enabled us to maintain the momentum behind our five strategic priorities and we remain committed to further strengthening our core businesses should attractive on strategy investment opportunities arise
3533107 i think what were seeing at this time in the marketplace is for strong financial institutions with plenty of capital there are opportunities there
3533108 and the price of assets is coming down but were not a buyer at high price
3533109 sometimes my eyes want to vomit from all the bad photography they have to see
3533110 weve been saying youre missing a great opportunity to get more of your people in here to celebrate your games
3533111 i would want to stress how important it is for the host city that the venues are seen to be full and everybody has the opportunity to enjoy the festivities
3533112 we have taken this up with organisers and the politicians
3533113 they have promised an improvement today and further improvement tomorrow we hope this is going to take place we need more people to have a higher atmosphere
3533114 when i went out there was a small trickle of people walking through
3533115 access is difficult and security is incredibly tight at some venues its surprising when there have been sellouts and you see quite a few empty seats at the stadiums you need warm enthusiastic crowds to help create an atmosphere for athletes to perform at their best
3533116 i just went to volleyball and it was absolutely rocking
3533117 if they find that there are not enough people or if they find too many empty seats they will organise some cheerleaders who are volunteers

3533119 it was confirmed that previously recorded footage was provided to the broadcasters for convenience and theatrical effects as in many other big events

3533143 we considered that the department for environment food and rural affairs defra best practice guidance on environmental claims stated that green claims should not be vague or ambiguous for instance by simply trying to give a good impression about general concern for the environment claims should always avoid the vague use of terms such as sustainable green non polluting and so on
3533144 defra had made that recommendation because although sustainable was a widely used term the lack of a universally agreed definition meant that it was likely to be ambiguous and unclear to consumers because we had not seen data that showed how shell was effectively managing carbon emissions from its oil sands projects in order to limit climate change we concluded that the ad was misleading
3533145 their extraction cannot be described as a sustainable process and for shell to claim otherwise was wholly misleading
3533146 development which meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs
3533147 meant helping to meet the worlds growing energy needs in economic social and environmentally responsible ways and that in all their operations they integrated economic environmental and social considerations into their business decision making
3533148 the asas decision to uphold wwfs complaint sends a strong signal to business and industry that greenwash is unacceptable
3533149 if shell were serious about sourcing sustainable energy then they would be far better placed investing in renewable energy such as wind tidal or solar power

3533155 some early life exposures such as maternal smoking during pregnancy or personal characteristics may impair the development of physical control and coordination as well as increasing the risk of obesity in later life
3533156 rather than being explained by a single factor an accumulation throughout life of many associated cultural personal and economic exposures is likely to underlie the risks for obesity and some elements of associated neurological function
3533157 its a combination of determining balls and strikes making contact and getting lucky enough to get a hit
3533158 theres an awful lot of brainpower going towards those flawed stats
3533159 but fantasy baseball has become the great schoolhouse for sabermetrics in a sense these stats become gateway drugs and it lets us introduce people to more interesting metrics and expand their horizons

3533174 if russia is allowed to follow through on a doctrine of issuing passports to residents of an adjacent country aiding the secessionists in their provocation of that country intervening on their behalf destroying the military infrastructure of that country annexing those territories and achieving regime change in the subject country and getting away with it well those are some terrible precedents for all who live on its borders to deal with russia today headline

3533180 the results showed that the preferences of women who began using the contraceptive pill shifted towards men with genetically similar odours
3533181 not only could mhc similarity in couples lead to fertility problems but it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the contraceptive pill as odour perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners
3533182 the ryder cup is in the back of my mind the way paul set it up if i win one or two events i could make the team thats who he wants a guy who is hot and hopefully im one of those guys

3533189 though parents want to make sure kids are fully prepared for school they will be comparing prices online and in stores before making any big purchases
3533190 they should take stock of what they already have in terms of clothing and supplies and see what they can repurpose
3533191 the history of behavior of these men including the current matter does not reflect the standard of excellence we aspire to on and off the mat
3533192 we have outstanding student athletes in our program and we will move forward in a positive manner toward our goals
3533193 i want to personally apologize for any embarrassment that may have been caused for our athletic department the university and our fans

3533196 now you be sure to get a writing pad and write down every single meteor you see id suggest lying on the hill at least four hours because you know you could see a lot of perseids in one hour but that might be an anomaly
3533197 very legend of sleepy hollow but you know what the mist really reminds me of
3533198 the tear gas the paris police released into the odeon metro station when i got trapped in a student demonstration it suddenly started rolling down the tracks what year was that lisa would know
3533199 telling people exactly what they want to hear feels dishonest get over it
3533200 i cant necessarily attack facebook or myspace but i can attack their users all day long
3533201 dont put anything on a facebook account that you dont consider public
3533202 every time they do that they are showing an implicit trust in whoever wrote the application and most people dont know who that is
3533203 social networks really dont care if you get pawned or not
3533204 people know if they go on a computer and download a program they could get a virus they dont have the same view of how dangerous that can be on a social networking site

3533209 security explorations successfully verified that suns implementation of mobile java technology used in its latest version of java wireless toolkit software is vulnerable to the discovered flaws
3533210 if a given vendor prefers to throw money for lawyers instead of spending them to improve the security of their products we cant do anything about it
3533211 in germany we always said the biggest thing to win is the league title because it is a competition for the whole season so we are looking for this title and also the champions league
3533212 we have a big target to win not just one title but go for all four so we need a big squad
3533213 the last few seasons we have done very well and we were very close but we want to win these titles and this season we will try again
3533214 if you dont know whats wrong after about five or six months and you have no improvement it is difficult in your mind to motivate yourself
3533215 to walk in the gym to walk with the physio and feel a little bit of an improvement then you get the motivation and you can keep going
3533216 but if you have no improvement then thats difficult and so i was very happy after i came back in december to play and come so close to a title
3533217 the confidence among the players is as high as i have known
3533218 every player has looked back at last season and seen how close we were despite the injuries and everything that happened
3533219 hes a proven big league pitcher at a time in which its hard to find pitching hes always pitched well
3533220 hes healthy now after the surgery its just he needs to build up his arm strength i dont know if theres enough time to do it but we also figure that we dont have anything to lose to try hes a guy that weve always liked
3533221 right now im feeling really good i need to throw innings so ill throw some innings at lakeland
3533222 i think its a shot i think freddy took a shot and obviously thought enough of us to sign with us and certainly we thought enough to sign him
3533223 take a shot see what happens i dont think either party has anything to lose but i think its a good deal for both parties
3533224 he has shown a lot of improvement the last few times and people feel hes ready to pitch there toledo
3533225 hes the man hes been there before hes been around the block a few times
3533226 but when youve got him in your side youve always got a chance the gaffer has brought quality in as well
3533227 the gaffer has tried to give him days off and he wont have them
3533228 he works hard hes never been the quickest so hes not lost his legs in that respect and he sets standards in our football club
3533229 it would be typical of him to score the opening goal people say at wembley it was written in the gods that he would score and he went and did it
3533230 in the previous year he scored a goal at cardiff that kept us in the championship its probably going to be him who is going to score on saturday
3533231 when i first joined the club i knew it could definitely be big enough to play in the top flight but i didnt realise it would happen as quickly as it has
3533232 on a personal level its brilliant and im looking forward to the challenge
3533233 you challenge yourself every year ive been promoted three times and each year ive proven that i can do it in every league i just want to prove it i can do it in this league
3533234 now is going to be the biggest challenge but people have done it in the past
3533235 i have had contact with representatives of those two clubs tottenham and roma
3533236 they asked monaco about my situation and about the chance of buying me
3533237 i always played very well against sevilla and i created some goals
3533238 this should have left juande with a good impression and now my name is on their list of signings
3533239 roma played a friendly against monaco here and that is when the first contact was
3533240 as captain and players we will have to make sure he doesnt get himself into trouble because referees will be after him id say
3533241 they target certain players and its part of my job to make sure he doesnt react
3533242 what you see with dioufy is what you get youre not going to change the way he plays and the way he conducts himself but its up to us to make sure he doesnt overstep the mark
3533243 the university of oxford has no record of mr ali kordan receiving an honorary doctorate or any other degree from the university
3533244 professor edmund rolls professor peter bryant and professor alan cowey have all at some stage held posts at the university of oxford however none of them work in the field of law and none of them would sign degree certificates
3533245 it is clear that many students are sleepwalking into financial crisis as the credit crunch kicks in and with food and fuel costs set to rise even further we can expect more and more students to get into serious financial difficulty with many having to resort to taking out commercial loans or being bailed out by their parents
3533246 it is extremely worrying that so many students expect to receive financial support yet do not go on to claim it at the moment each university is left to administer its own bursary system and students tell us that the application process is often very confusing
3533247 instead of the system being different in every university we need a single national student support scheme so it is simpler for students to make a claim and so that support is based on what students need not where they study
3533248 lecturers have little desire to teach students who are shattered from working long hours to pay the bills or stressed because of their financial situation
3533249 it is students from poorer backgrounds that find themselves hit the hardest as they are less likely to be able to rely on financial support from their parents
3533250 although getting on the housing ladder or starting a pension will be distant dreams for the majority of generation debt the government must reject calls for higher fees and greater student debt in next years fees review
3533251 fear of debt is a real issue that concerns universities government universities schools and colleges all those involved must continue to ensure that all those who can benefit from going to university are not deterred from doing so by the prospect of debt
3533252 attitudes towards undertaking manageable debt are changing and the vast majority of students see attending university as a worthwhile investment in their future
3533253 what these surveys sometimes fail to acknowledge is the reality that if you succeed at university your employment prospects will be enhanced and you are likely to earn more over your working lifetime
3533254 graduates in the uk continue to enjoy one of the highest financial returns of any oecd country
3533255 i have fulfilled a dream it will be unique he said on skysports
3533256 i have arrived to help spurs i am also here to fight for my place
3533257 it is up to the manager gomes is a good keeper i believe that the both of us offer a good level
3533258 tottenham want a big season and i am ready for the challenge i know the spurs squad is capable of a great performance in the premier league i am prepared for everything
3533259 i have had contact with representatives of those two clubs tottenham and roma
3533260 they asked monaco about my situation and about the chance of buying me
3533261 i always played very well against sevilla and i created some goals
3533262 we cannot allow him to leave through the back door

3533265 i never gave it a second thought as to whether or not i would debate in elections as leader of the team of course i debated any opponent
3533266 we are disappointed that tom latham refused to debate becky greenwald at the iowa farmers union convention we tried to work with his schedule and find a venue for a debate at an event latham would already be attending
3533267 iowans deserve to hear from tom latham why after 14 years in congress he has done nothing to address the energy crisis lack of care for our veterans and the high cost of healthcare
3533268 they blackburn seem interested as they came all the way here to see me

3533278 oh my god can you believe how cool we are

3533283 one month after its debut apples new iphone has hit the 3 million sold mark according to analyst michael cote of the cote collaborative
3533284 they are seeing unprecedented demand says cote adding that there appears to be no signs of a let up yet cote a former t mobile executive has been extremely accurate with wireless predictions in the past
3533285 the blistering sales pace of apples new gadget defies the otherwise downward trends in consumer spending employment levels and overall economic health the 3 million figure is much higher than wall street analysts had anticipated forecasts called for total quarterly sales of three million to four million
3533286 three days after the new iphones july 11 debut apple announced that it had sold 1 million iphones
3533287 the demand is so strong it may impact or delay the new countries coming on cote says

3533293 ive never been involved in a game like that before as a pro going wire to wire with no penalties or turnovers
3533294 those are the two things that stand out to me about tonights game and thats what we continue to emphasize around here winning edges
3533295 thats something our line takes a great deal of pride in keeping our defense fresh
3533296 converting on third and 1 is like making a statement tonight was nothing i havent seen from michael bennett before he just works hard and doesnt complain hes consistent and before you know it hes going to give you that big run
3533297 everyone in this room already knows how good michael bennett is
3533298 hes fast hes strong and hes got good vision fundamentally this was a very good game for us no penalties or turnovers thats what you want we didnt do the little things that get you beat in this league
3533299 we got into a good rhythm and when other guys came in they did a great job too
3533300 we had a good running game going tonight were going to watch the film today and there will be a lot to build on i thought we looked pretty good out there
3533301 it feels good to say i played my first game as a pro
3533302 just like i expected the speed of the game in the nfl is a lot faster
3533303 you really wont know until you sit down and watch the tape but id say it was ok
3533304 its only one game but our line has taken an extra step
3533305 we kept converting on short yardage tonight and we did it convincingly where you dont even have to bring out the sticks to measure
3533306 they were all young last year and they kind of got thrown into the fire and did really well now theyre a year older and adding jeff faine at center really helps the offensive line should be one of the strong points of our team all season long
3533307 you cant make a steak out of a pigs ear
3533308 we are not crazy fashion forward but we have a great style
3533309 i had just gotten into a women in politics program at american and realized my passion was really for fashion i quit my job and opened the georgetown store
3533310 2005 was the year for dc cusp intermix barneys all came and changed the face of georgetown and we actually do better with more stores it brings more traffic
3533311 my biggest mistake was over buying its so hard to predict and if you buy too much it can kill you
3533312 after we open annapolis we will go national boston philadelphia new york but well wait till the economy stabilizes
3533313 when crazy people smell blood its impossible to stop them you have to use surgery to stop them

3533333 credit unions were created to offer credit to people with modest means
3533334 so historically its very much in keeping with their mission
3533335 and there are people absolutely who are falling through the cracks
3533336 our intent is to get people in the door and introduce them to traditional banking products
3533337 credit unions are in their formative years of learning to deal with the community charter and learning marketing
3533338 they were enthusiastic and looking into it and prepared to fill the breach
3533339 it was kind of a convergence of two different trends
3533340 i think the community sees it as an easy fix
3533341 its hard to get persons to talk to our financial counselor so that we can get their financial status in a
3533342 the good news is that there may be still a possibility to move this forward and conclude these negotiations within the time frame which all the wto members had agreed since last year that is end 2008

3533346 furthermore the problem with society is not bad education it is bad character sin the solution is not homeschooling it is the gospel of jesus christ and participating in the growing kingdom of god the utopian society is not homeschool grads in power but the consummation of the kingdom of god which will only occur at the second coming of the lord in glory i fear that many in the christian homeschooling movement have a false understanding of the problem the solution and the ultimate goal and smooth talking eloquent yet misguided speakers that give vision and encouragement to homeschooling parents are not helping build the kingdom of god
3533347 we have conducted workshops in three colleges including ruparel and somaiya college

3533354 perhaps the best way to think about the vice presidential sweepstakes is as an extended and very public job interview

3533360 as per our guidelines status of rane continues as minister of revenue despite his absence from mantralaya for seven days without citing any reasons

3533364 this is more likely to provide some temporary strength than act as a support for an upward trend
3533365 for the past three weeks i have been getting calls regularly from dy patil medical colleges worli branch asking me to take admission in their pg course in medicine although i have denied any interest they keep calling
3533366 the caller informed me that if i wait for the pg entrance exam in january i will have to serve the one year rural internship according to the central government norms to qualify for the post graduate course
3533367 the centre has not yet issued any such instructions the caller was trying to scare us so that we would take admission in their course
3533368 the worli branch makes the call to students to inform them of the course only they will be able to give further information about this
3533369 i think im a little old for a gymnast we had been through a lot over the last eight years

3533371 do not ignore your fever it could be malaria dengue or leptospirosis
3533372 both of them succumbed to the deadly falciparum strain of malaria
3533373 contaminated water can cause anything from gastroenteritis which can be treated in a couple of days to leptospirosis which can even claim your life

3533378 i knew park is strong in the last 50 meters
3533379 so i knew i had to be fast and concentrated
3533380 i knew when i saw the 1 by my name because at first i thought i saw the clock wrong its a great feeling
3533381 obviously to hear his voice and get leadership from him meant a tremendous amount to myself and the guys
3533382 he just told us it will be difficult but together were going to be much stronger
3533383 he knows we need him im sure his interests are conflicted hell be back when hes ready
3533384 we didnt know if it was something related to u s athletes or usa volleyball or a random act of violence which we now know it was
3533385 my wife always puts things in perspective she said bad things happen in ft wayne indiana where were from every day but we still go to coney island downtown we still go get gas we still go to wal mart
3533386 and thats how you have to live your life and while your thoughts are prayers are with the family hugh elisabeth the bachmans they would want us to continue on this journey we started
3533387 mccutheons a wonderful passionate loving coach who cares about his team and about what were trying to build and develop here
3533388 they told me we succeeded we are the world champions i told them we reached our target
3533389 other teams were good but we were better we performed perfect today everyone was excellent
3533390 it bothers me a lot especially if people from home kind of put down our team saying count the u
3533391 i wish more people in the u s believed in us like we believed in us now i hope more people realize the u s is a force to be reckoned with
3533392 since athens the chinese team has run into a lot of failures which tested the team
3533393 i know them and they do work very hard and put a lot of hard work in their training we worked as team we enjoyed it and thats more important than anything
3533394 we always believed in ourselves and we kept at it tenacious
3533395 and our guys knocked it out of the park it was just amazing
3533396 i just went into this weird funk and i dyed my hair black when we were dating nick wanted me to get highlights and so i did that and i got myself looking great and then on the day we broke up i was like i want to make my hair black now i dont want to look pretty i want to look hard core i was rebelling against everything nick wanted me to be and then i was like ive got to be by myself for now and just figure out who i really am
3533397 we still do but we were in love with each other for two years he was basically my 24 7 but it was really hard to keep it from people we were arguing a lot and it really wasnt fun
3533398 maybe hell be my best friend for the rest of my life or maybe ill end up marrying nick jonas
3533399 since the breakup i have realized that ive met so many great guys but i like being the girl nobody can have
3533400 we didnt give up and were not going to give up
3533401 no body no case is what we were told in the beginning and that isnt so
3533402 the history of behavior of these men including the current matter does not reflect the standard of excellence we aspire to on and off the mat
3533403 we have outstanding student athletes in our program and we will move forward in a positive manner toward our goals
3533404 i want to personally apologize for any embarrassment that may have been caused for our athletic department the university and our fans
3533405 after a few months of tinkering and pulling out much hair the first beta of athens101 2 is up right now its a bit plain looking but that will change over the next few days the hard part was converting all of our users and forum post over to the new cms that was completed today at 5pm

3533407 there are 11 mobile homes on the property full of junk trash and debris
3533408 the houses are full to the ceilings they are clearly hoarders but theyre also raising and breeding rabbits and dogs i dont know if theyre selling
3533409 casinos were considered some time ago to be recession proof

3533412 fascinating prints by artists including edward hopper depicting the us in the first half of the 20th century
3533413 i joined the unit more or less agnostic on drugs policy being personally opposed to drug use but open minded about the best way to deal with the problem
3533414 i was certainly not inclined to decriminalise however during my time in the unit as i saw more and more evidence of what works to quote new labours mantra of the time it became apparent to me that enforcement and supply side interventions were largely pointless they have no significant lasting impact on the availability affordability or use of drugs
3533415 i think what was truly depressing about my time in ukadcu was that the overwhelming majority of professionals i met including those from the police the health service the government and voluntary sectors held the same view the illegality of drugs causes far more problems for society and the individual than it solves yet publicly all those intelligent knowledgeable people were forced to repeat the nonsensical mantra that the government would be tough on drugs even though they all knew the governments policy was actually causing harm
3533416 tobacco is a legal drug whose use is declining and precisely because it is legal its users are far more amenable to government control education programmes and taxation
3533417 the idea that many people are holding back solely because of a law which they know is already unenforceable is simply ridiculous
3533418 julian critchley is one of the brave few to tell the truth about the failure of prohibition and the need to replace it with a system of regulation
3533419 it is truly shameful that there are so many more who know that the war on drugs is overwhelmingly counterproductive and yet continue to remain silent tacitly endorsing a policy that they know creates misery degradation and death for millions across the globe
3533420 we dont have to worry about iraq turning into another vietnam because we have an exit strategy

3533427 they mobilize themselves without a need for a central location to do so distribute the targets discuss the attack approaches come up with a plan on the coordination and you have everyone participating
3533428 a bunch of youth groups posted something that was almost a manifesto that called on supporter to wage an information war against georgia
3533429 in the ongoing russian versus georgia cyberwar we have an indication of lists of georgian governmental sites actively distributed across russian web forums
3533430 by posting on blogs and forums instructions that essentially say this is what were going to do but we dont know whos behind that
3533431 georgian hackers or pro georgian hackers launched distributed denial of service attacks against ria novosti
3533432 questo tipo di comportamento ha degli effetti fortissimi sulla vita quotidiana delle persone omosessuali il 71 percento infatti si sente vittima di discriminazioni il 54 si sente rifiutato dalla societ il 46 avverte una mancanza di rispetto nei propri confronti e ben il 71 8 ritiene di non avere le stesse possibilit lavorative di un eterosessuale
3533433 web 2 0 has been hyped a lot to the extent that many investors view it as a bubble but in most cases it has not delivered tangible business value
3533434 we believe that it will follow the hype cycle and following initial disillusionment progress eventually to large scale shifts in creating intellectual capital and decision making
3533435 the main message of the hype cycle is that organisations need to make sure that when they adopt technologies early they do so for the right reasons because it is aligned with an area where it is important for them to innovate not because everyone is doing it
3533436 with information access technology companies that previously made retention decisions based on intuitive judgements about what was important can now designate critically on more advance approaches for measuring the value of content

3533442 were not looking at having one sole distributor here in australia because we dont feel they can offer the value that they can provide to our channel that we can provide directly
3533443 internationally we obviously cant afford to put a big team of people into each country so we have to move to the other model
3533444 at the high end of the market commuters are increasingly switching to more advanced devices called smart phones that can handle applications such as email and web browsing
3533445 smart phones should grow in popularity as they decline in price due in large part to companies such as nokia and google developing free operating systems however at the same time sales of simple cheap mobile phones are booming as other phone makers move into emerging markets
3533446 a key problem here is that these enhanced phones such as motorolas razr 2 and the lg voyager use closed operating systems so new software cant be added to the devices the closed operating systems that run enhanced phones are typically built internally by phone makers
3533447 using open systems that are free saves money and gives customers access to a greater selection of applications which aids carriers because they get more revenue when subscribers sign up for data plans to browse the internet
3533448 major handset manufacturers are expected to change their product development in anticipation of these changes nokia is already taking this move and is developing phones to meet the high and low end demand its most advanced models let people play music take videos manage email and navigate foreign cities with street by street guides
3533449 the proposition 98 guarantee has been lowered by 1 4 billion for 2007 08 resulting in an over appropriation of 400 million to k 12 education

3533453 is not a matter of our equipment but a matter of our poverty not of what we bring with us but of what god puts in us not a matter of natural virtues of strength of character of knowledge or of experience all of that is of no avail in this concern
3533454 the most important aspect of christianity is not the work we do but the relationship we maintain and the surrounding influence and qualities produced by that relationship that is all god asks us to give our attention to and it is the one thing that is continually under attack
3533455 i thought we had a good shot based on the fact that testifying against him were criminals crack heads and wack jobs
3533456 nobody saw him do it and the people that said he talked about doing it are all basically bipeds two legged sub humans so i thought that was a credibility problem but obviously the jury disagreed
3533457 pleased with the work the jury has done and all the work done by law enforcement fire personnel and the community to get this conviction
3533458 hes clearly upset with the verdict i think its a verdict that is very clearly in the interest of justice

3533467 i feel very honoured to be receiving this mentorship award
3533468 it is a privilege that my career allowed me to mentor other female physicians who wanted to contribute medically to the community as well as take care of their families
3533469 juggling part time work around motherhood enabled me to raise my family but as they became independent it enabled me to be more available to pursue the introduction of new more challenging though time consuming medical services such as sexual assault examinations palliative care and oncology
3533470 caring for terminal cancer patients brought me into the realms of multidisciplinary teamwork home visits and very compassionate and professionally rewarding work

3533476 while our operations will continue to be affected by the normal seasonality of the oil and gas operations in western canada particularly as is witnessed in the second quarter due to spring breakup we believe that the encouraging signs we have begun to see in industry activity levels will continue through 2008 and early 2009
3533477 impax remains focused on the efficient operation of its existing businesses and the reduction of current indebtedness
3533478 the company has made significant progress in a very short period of time we will continue to improve plant and mine operations over the next few months this will increase production and reduce the fixed cost component of our per unit cash cost expansion plans are proceeding well and the recent drill results give us every confidence that we can significantly ramp up mine throughput and increase the overall mill feed grade
3533479 in addition we are on track to complete a development and commercialization partnership with a large pharmaceutical company that fully values the significant potential of our technology
3533480 the interest of alzheimers physicians and researchers has substantially increased allons standing in the alzheimers community and resulted in international media coverage about our program and the increasing prominence of the tangles pathway as a treatment target for the disease
3533481 having completed a 20 million financing subsequent to the end of the second quarter we also have the financial resources to capitalize on this interest
3533482 the new machine is vastly more efficient than our current machine it has absolutely state of the art software which in some areas puts us ahead of current industry standards there are big improvements to functionality and efficiency
3533483 the new mri allows us to take real time images of the heart so we will be able to see the heart beating while the patient is being scanned this will allow our clinicians to evaluate for things such as myocardial infarction heart attack and cardiac output
3533484 we can now also take full body images in an instant instead of taking a series of images and then having to collate them again this will save lots of time for our patients and clinicians helping us become more efficient
3533485 unlike the old machines the new software means the patient in some instances will not need to hold their breath because the software self corrects to allow for movement
3533486 the machine is also more precise so we will have better tumour or lesion detection and we can now perform angiography this allows us to watch blood flow within the vessels of the heart in real time the technology is truly awesome and the radiology team is very much looking forward to learning to use the new machine
3533487 the new equipment future proofs radiology service delivery for the people of the wellington region for the next decade anticipating population growth and a change in the health needs of our population improved efficiencies in our hardware and service delivery are crucial im very excited to be at the helm of the dhb at this time
3533488 now we are bringing to bear the unprecedented collaboration in scientific resources of five national laboratories to bring about the needed transformation of the built environment lower our carbon footprint in buildings and accelerate commercial deployment of clean efficient building technologies
3533489 thats where the majority of greenhouse gas comes from in housing its probably the one area thats most palatable because there are measurable benefits people know theres a specific timeline from which they can recoup costs and measured the effect on greenhouse gas emissions
3533490 we continue to make progress on the transition to a new strategic direction which we anticipate will allow woodbridge to utilize its cash assets and expertise to capitalize on opportunities inside and outside the real estate industry

3533509 of course you wonder what your own reaction would be in that situation you picture what youd do to her kidnappers and you soon come to the conclusion that youd do anything in your power to save your child
3533510 i found this particularly interesting territory because im traditionally against violence especially the kind of violence bryan resorts to in the movie but its a case of them or me and bryan takes that situation to its logical conclusion

3533513 non stavo giocando bene e questo mi dava fastidio quando scendo in campo il mio proposito sempre quello di fare bene per la squadra e per questo che il gol contro laustralia mi ha dato fiducia
3533514 ricordo di aver visto la squadra che vinse il titolo nel 2004
3533515 the fun part about animation especially in the clone wars in particular is that were allowed to go and do stories about clones

3533517 were not encumbered by this mythological uberstory of the psychological underpinnings of why somebody turns to be a bad person
3533518 dr hebert has played a pivotal leadership role in the development of an integrated and practical professional ethics education for medical trainees and physicians
3533519 he has made a unique and remarkable contribution to the growing awareness of this important medical field
3533520 many many individuals have contributed to the advancement of medical ethics and i am just proud to have played a small part in this process
3533521 ethics is indeed a very important aspect of medicine today not in terms of armchair philosophizing but about what should be done in order to look after our patients compassionately and professionally
3533522 medical ethics can remind us of our primary commitment to the welfare of our patients
3533523 it is extremely humbling to be recognized by the cma the previous winners have made significant contributions and it is an honour to be part of that company
3533524 to reach out to diverse communities be part of their lives and respond to their evolving needs is tremendously rewarding by immersing ourselves in the community we students learn to work together and introduce meaningful changes to society the true crowning of our lives is when we can have an impact on the lives of others
3533525 i have been fortunate to be surrounded by several individuals who have become valuable mentors role models colleagues and friends many of these individuals have lived and taught the adage that a person who is not willing to follow is not prepared to lead
3533526 the medical profession has not just an obligation but a sincere responsibility to ensure that the
3533527 i continue to be thrilled and impressed by the quality of our young leaders
3533528 given their intelligence commitment innovation and determination i believe that the profession will be in good hands in the future

3533535 stond ik daar een dik uur lang in mijn uppie echt niets om me heen

3533542 parec a un reality arriesgado pero los ni os son naturales
3533543 he has served alaska for 40 years but his time is over
3533544 only if your on welfare and too lazy to work and getting everything free from the state then yes
3533545 the government should stay out of our lives as much as possible
3533546 yes they should allow a certain number of kids for the amount of income
3533547 no the government should not have that much power over you
3533548 if you are on government assistance or have had problems w child neglect or abuse then yes
3533549 absolutly not this is a free country they allready tell us what we can amp cant do with our kids they dont need 2 us howmany kids we can have
3533550 no way thats taking away our rights whats next although some people shouldnt be allowed 2 have kids at all but thats a whole new download
3533551 i agree with christine too many people have kids and let welfare pay for them
3533552 go christine i agree with you whole heartily why should we pay for others to have children that they can not afford to feed or clothe it is their assumption that medicaid and adc will take care of all of their needs maybe the american government should limit the amount of children these particular people can have
3533553 no i dont think the goverment should decide how many kids we have what would they do make women have abortions
3533554 what really is needed is a test to determine that a person is competent to become a parent in the first place anyone can have kids and far too many have no parenting skills or poor skills at best most of societys ills can be directly linked to poor child rearing
3533555 i dont think the govenment should say how many but that one should use their head and only have a couple as the way the world is today and every thing going up in price money only goes so far
3533556 it is immoral for a government to restrict the size of ones family the atrocities in china to enforce this policy are abhorrent forced abortions sterilization and yet god can turn any situation for good as is evidenced through our beautiful adopted chinese daughter
3533557 only if the tax payers are paying for your kids
3533558 as long as the children are loved the parents should have as many as they want
3533559 children are a product of love love should know no bounds
3533560 i dont think that the government should tell us how many kids we can have there taking pretty much taking all that we got now but they can
3533561 i dont believe we live in a dictatorship yet so only bad parents should limited those who lose them because of drugs or child abuse
3533562 maybe we could place a limit on the number of kids welfare would support
3533563 i have to agree with the 1 child law theres nothing worse than working hard then seeing someone on welfare that im supporting with 3 or 4 children not working and not caring to work maybe if there was a limit it might slow down those who think a child is something that can be used to collect welfare or special services that need to be kept for those who truly need them maybe the state should penalize a woman who is on welfare and not working to support herself and her child or maybe each state should make those on welfare with children work a specific amount of hours each week to help pay for the services they recieve just an idea that might save us all a lot of money
3533564 the dogs that would come down to our house were mangy looking losing their hair skin and bones
3533565 its definitely one of the worst that i have seen
3533566 horrible one of the worst places ive ever been in in the county

3533568 only by ending attempts to drastically alter the 1999 constitution is ch vez likely to return venezuela to democratic stability
3533569 november municipal and regional elections could produce a dramatic new setback for his chavez increasingly autocratic bolivarian revolution
3533570 the venezuelan government has gone to great lengths to ensure the legitimacy of the electoral process
3533571 the government controlled national assembly na passed an enabling law ley habilitante which grants him chavez full legislative powers until the end of july 2008
3533572 we had a problem with the venezuelan opposition which assured us that they would not withdraw from the electoral process if certain conditions were met by the government
3533573 in the run up to the legislative elections the opposition withdraws after an oas audit of the machines to verify voter identity showed that ballot secrecy could not be guaranteed
3533574 pursue a foreign policy conducive to peace and security in latin america and the caribbean
3533575 there is no evidence and no member country including this one united states has offered the oas such proof
3533576 social spending funded by the oil windfall appears to have yielded only modest and in the long term unsustainable gains for the poorest part of the population
3533577 circus is designed to be experienced in the round and the dome gives more front row seats

3533579 bringing the francodome to b c is an opportunity to showcase the artistry and culture of our provinces community and celebrate with francophones across the country
3533580 google s acquisition of begun is likely to significantly alter the advertising channel allowing google to enhance monetisation of its already significant 35 share of the search market this will likely challenge the current dominance of yandex and although we continue to assume that yandex will maintain its leading position we believe that there is now debate as to whether russia will become a google country
3533581 although google does not disclose information about its russian operations industry sources estimate that it had approximately 5 revenue share in 2006 and 2007 implying a search monetisation 4 7 times lower than that of yandex this appears to be caused by google s inability thus far to adjust to peculiarities of the russian payment system i e cash direct money transfer etc rather than cheques as well as the lack of a direct sales force this weakness was the key underpinning and rationale for the begun transaction
3533582 overall rankings for the russian market have changed significantly over the past year with two social networking sites
3533583 randy scheunemann is at a vital nexus and it made tbilisi feel as if it was wedged into the back pocket of dick cheney
3533584 i would say georgia has a very good pr team the u s and the georgian government built a very close relationship and it was too close for the good of either party the u s allowed saakashvili to get too puffed up and think he could fly too close to the sun
3533585 the idea is to take the kids in turns so each family has responsibility for all of the children once or twice during the two week period
3533586 in previous years we met in advance to plan and put in money and effort parents took the kids to a local amusement park to a movie to the pool this year we felt that since the kids are older we can cool it a little with the outings once a week is enough
3533587 all of the activities are centered around a specific theme for example we had a chocolate day where we read a book on the subject and made desserts or an athletic tournament with water games in the pool one father took the kids to the beach and taught them how to surf in another home there was a cooking day and weve also done a crafts day each parent does the things he or she knows how to do
3533588 i love going to concerts and buying cds and that costs money at the start of vacation i worked in a falafel stand at the register then i did tutoring but by my calculations the camp is far more profitable at first i calculated it according to five kids for five days but the response to the e mail i sent out to parents was so great that i expanded it and also brought my sister onto the staff
3533589 we sat down and planned many different activities my sister and i before the camp began we didnt come to it empty handed
3533590 every day theres a theme we planned it so thered be one very interesting and appealing activity that focuses the kids around the table for about half an hour or an hour basically we realized that kids mainly like to play with each other and also to beat each other up so for part of the day they really do play the games we organized for them and we also spend time separating them thats natural but when we do one thing with educational content during the day its interesting for us and the parents are satisfied of course most of the activities are science oriented for example we made a pretty sophisticated sundial with a compass inside its 15 minutes fast but its impressive nonetheless and it works in winter as well as summer
3533591 the child on the screen should be flawless in image in her internal feelings and in her expression in the matter of her voice yang peiyi was flawless in the unanimous opinion of all the members of the team
3533592 we have a responsibility to face the audience of the whole country and to be open with this explanation we should all understand it like this it is a question of the national interest it is a question of the image of our national music our national culture
3533593 especially at the entrance of our national flag this is an extremely important an extremely serious matter
3533594 so we made the choice i think it is fair to both lin miaoke and yang peiyi after all we have a perfect voice a perfect image and a perfect show in our teams view all together
3533595 although im not a marketing major i have a bit of a trusted reputation after 18 years self promoting
3533596 id like to inform you i had no say in this marketing campaign but if i did things would be different since it is obvious that this poster is boring odd
3533597 my character is sporting a very high collar i mean damn they should be snow capped at that altitude its going for the vampire lurking in the castle basement vibe an olympic pole vaulter would have a tough go clearing that collar im also able to turn my head comfortably 180 degrees because i was raised in an abandoned barn by a family of owls

3533602 we do what we think is appropriate in order to have 47 000 affordable seats we had to have 4 500 expensive seats
3533603 we were trying to produce revenue that would support our expenses and our debt service but also balance that against the realities that tickets were going to be going up for our customers we were going to deliver qualitatively a far far higher product for them
3533604 decadence was once a word that lived in the depths under the pressure of extreme consciousness now it exists in the thin air of the pretence of extremity a device for the imitation of spiritual or moral concern or for mocking them

3533611 but thats just going to put a little more added pressure on doing things right our strong belief is there will be guys who really step up during this time period
3533612 where we are in the standings isnt because of any one player
3533613 so this is certainly a challenge for us but we have great confidence in the guys we do have
3533614 have you noticed the line work being done on your street

3533617 im taking it day to day week to week all im doing every day is looking forward to my next day

3533619 my girlfriend thinks im crazy cuz my shoe box stacks are taller than she is
3533620 my plan was to play the fedexcup but i dont know if i have quite enough points to be safe
3533621 so i might have to go back and earn some more
3533622 i still have an opportunity to qualify but that opportunity is now off the world points list rather than the euros and im a long way off of that list i basically have to win simple as that
3533623 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful

3533629 we set our price where we think it was fair given all considerations of the various issues
3533630 we do what we think is appropriate in order to have 47 000 affordable seats we had to have 4 500 expensive seats

3533634 i had to deal with it on my way up now im dumping it all on you
3533635 we have to adapt to the environmental changes that have already taken place or that we can reasonably expect will occur because of climate change
3533636 the city was built with an assumption of an environmental baseline and climate change in many ways changes that baseline
3533637 some of these transformations can potentially be catastrophic as large storms others might be more subtle and difficult to discern over the short term
3533638 were delighted to bring dan ariens onto the executive committee
3533639 dan has served the organization well on the board and as the chair of the marketing committee he has a very successful background in business and also has served in a variety of roles in the community we look forward to his continued contributions to the success of the packers
3533640 there are costs to adapting to climate change by planning now we can reduce our exposure to weather related events
3533641 an increasingly large part of the signal is becoming due to human activity
3533642 if mini takes the low rent approach with the next gen mini the car will be reduced to just another econobox with a cute face i really hope this never happens
3533643 an increasingly large part of the signal is becoming due to human activity
3533644 the proposed regulations will continue to protect species while focusing the consultation process on those federal actions where potential impacts can be linked to the action and the risks are reasonably certain to occur
3533645 the result should be a process that is less time consuming and a more effective use of our resources
3533646 it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3533647 with these changes the bush administration threatens to undo more than 30 years of progress
3533648 these changes take unbiased professional wildlife biologists out of the equation and put decisions in the hands of political appointees
3533649 gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3533650 repeats and includes all of the disdain for science and political trumping of expertise that has characterized previous bush administration efforts to dismantle fundamental environmental laws
3533651 there will always be criticism any time you suggest changes to the endangered species act
3533652 will provide clarity and certainty to the consultation process under the endangered species act
3533653 i am deeply troubled by this proposed rule which gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3533654 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government this is not the type of legacy this interior department should be leaving for future generations
3533655 clearly thats a case of asking the fox to guard the chicken coop
3533656 a giant caution light that made federal agencies stop and think about the impacts of their actions
3533657 what the bush administration is telling those agencies is they dont have to think about those impacts anymore
3533658 we have to have the ability to put our efforts where theyre needed
3533659 this really says to the agencies this law belongs to all of us
3533660 because it is not possible to link the emissions to impacts on specific listed species such as polar bears
3533661 so we dont inadvertently have the endangered species act seen as a back door to climate change policy that was never ever intended
3533662 clarity on an issue that if it was left broad and ambiguous could be a serious problem for the home building industry here in california
3533663 for home builders clarity in the rules is always always helpful
3533664 encouragement from both sides of the aisle to see if we couldnt bring about steps that would make the endangered species act more effective
3533665 if the worlds brown people would stop having so many babies thered be no crisis
3533666 climate change will bring two new elements increased frequency and intensity and maybe new hazards to areas that have not experienced disasters
3533667 it doesnt matter whos emitting the green house gases everyone will feel the impact more so in vulnerable communities
3533668 cities need to understand that there are short term mid term and longer term actions that can and are being taken to build their resilience

3533682 i dont know that ive ever felt that way but i do feel called

3533684 the conduct then was in the defendants scope of employment regardless of whether it was unlawful or contrary to the national security of the united states
3533685 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
3533686 the thoughts and the prayers and support of the american people are with that brave little nation as they struggle for their freedom and independence
3533687 and he wanted me to say thank you to you to give you his heartfelt thanks for the support of the american people for this tiny little democracy far away from the united states of america

3533698 just be an inspiration to them and give them a fresh word from god so they can continue on until their husbands do come home
3533699 i hope we leave them with just a hope that its almost over and just a renewed spirit that gods with them and theyre going to make it

3533704 the absorption of such substance by hair is extremely low if not null
3533705 if they did test positive of course they would scrutinize it and review where the substance came from and make the individual decision based on the individual case but there is the potential that performance gains could be linked to the anabolic agent

3533708 any health related effect associated with the specified use of and as an ingredient in got2b magnetik is considered to be extremely unlikely but to avoid any eventual signal in analytical test results the abstinence of such products for top ranking sportsmen should be the precautionary principle

3533717 theres some issues as to whether or not there is a mistake i heard recently that the amount of heparin given to these children was therapeutic

3533723 even if airlines dont start using seats designed specifically for back and neck pain sufferers there are some easy ways you can take care of your back and neck on a flight
3533724 if you are a neck pain sufferer you can bring an inflatable air pillow with you it wont take up much room in your carry on especially important in air travel today and it will provide good support for your head and neck while flying
3533725 for back pain sufferers try rolling a pillow blanket or sweater into a lower back support its best if you can have one support on each side of your back you may also want to try the backjoy a small seat orthotic that works really well

3533729 i have been attending tiff since fire in 1996 it is a film lovers festival and i am pleased that firaaq will have its world premiere at tiff festivals are very important to garner attention and international buyers for the film i am looking forward to share this film with people in india this time competition will be tough as many films by seasoned directors are contending for the place
3533730 percept picture company has been always recognized for producing thoughtful films with the screening of two indian films at toronto international film festival indian talent will get an international platform to scatter their light all around the world we are delighted with our association with an extremely talented actor and now a director nandita das this is a grand opportunity for us to get in touch with the worldwide audience
3533731 firaaq has five different stories that are at times interconnected and at times discrete the characters are across class gender age and community that represent a cross section of society the film is an aftermath story so there is hardly any violence in the film but a lot of tension and fear that surrounds the people

3533738 its not a question of people who are already overweight becoming clumsy because the majority of these children werent any heavier than their peers

3533756 when i peruse ministry books websites magazines and attend conferences im bombarded with one overwhelming message great ministry results are the product of great ministry leadership if a church is growing if lives are changing if budgets are burgeoning it must be because the leader is doing something right conversely if the church is shrinking if lives are struggling if budgets are busting it must be because the leader is inept as a result a pastors success and self worth is inexorably linked to his her measurable performance stewing in this toxic brew is it any wonder why pastors souls are shriveling somethings wrong
3533757 brothers and sisters you are more than the measurable outcomes of your work yes we need to work diligently and serve christ with our very best this is our worship to god but how we define success should look very different in the economy of gods kingdom from the tangible stats the world celebrates
3533758 ministry involves the baffling interplay of the human and the divine the spiritual and the material there is a mystery to what we are called to do embracing this mystery and releasing the outcomes of our work to god is what we must do if our lives and not just our ministries are to be filled with his grace

3533761 voc agradar a todos muito dif cil cada um tem sua opini o e voc tem que respeitar eu n o sou dono da verdade n o sou nenhum menino sou muito experiente e sei as rea es do meio a torcida tem uma posi o contr ria quando os resultados n o s o positivos
3533762 a gente vai estudar posteriormente o beto um jogador interessant ssimo de velocidade de boa t cnica isso a gente vai ver o decorrer da competi o
3533763 no futebol aquela velha m xima mais do que batida n s podemos empatar ganhar ou perder a torcida certamente sabe que estamos fazendo o nosso melhor agora eu n o vou me esconder de maneira alguma tenho pouco tempo de trabalho no vasco mas eu poderia muito bem ter pedido ao presidente roberto dinamite para n o comandar a equipe em salvador eu dou a cara para bater

3533768 mobilizing young voters in california will be the key to victory on many important issues this november
3533769 we will fight back against the many flawed propositions on the ballot and open up opportunities for young voters to find real solutions to our states long term needs
3533770 i feel like nancy pelosi as the democratic leader has failed our country miserably funding for more war the speakers failed to hold george bush and dick cheney accountable
3533771 weve made out position very clear as to how we are going to participate in debates
3533772 its ridiculous for him not to schedule any debate any time hes here
3533773 its a sign hes afraid to come back to the district
3533774 i feel like nancy pelosi as the democratic leader has failed our country miserably funding for more war the speakers failed to hold george bush and dick cheney accountable
3533775 we are talking about people who are presumed innocent and they have certain rights to be given humane conditions in jail
3533776 we run a safe constitutionally mandated jail and i think the court will recognize that
3533777 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3533778 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3533779 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen
3533780 lin miaoke was the best in this and yang peiyis voice was the most outstanding
3533781 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3533782 children as young as three years old can be taught and they can learn that matches and lighters are not toys
3533783 to try to enter it as stolen that makes it difficult so then we really go basically on the description
3533784 a lot of bikes are taken unfortunately just to get from one part of town to another and then dropped off and pretty soon somebody else comes along find it laying and they drive it to another part and the bike sort of just gets moved around
3533785 were just asking them to shift back 10 of the spending they do outside of town back to mower county businesses if they do so itll have a 20 million impact on our county
3533786 thats a major benefit its very green friendly but were also talking about job creation and all the charitable work donations that businesses give to our community
3533787 is that going to happen again is this the most feasible way to go
3533788 right now its not a very pretty sight the sooner we get it fixed it would be better for everybody
3533789 you can see what a big gaping hole that is how tons of water literally moved all the rocks way back up the river
3533790 we figure that just during this years school year were gonna be at 126 000 for fuel cost
3533791 were trying to be proactive with the spike in fuel costs and how we deal with that cause in the whole scheme of things the only thing we can control is miles
3533792 its a three phase plan if the cost of diesel gets to 4 20 were got things well put into place 4 50 and 4 80
3533793 its very hard were in education were about kids and opportunities and so we have that here and all the sudden youve got fiscal responsibility here and those two clash right now
3533794 were prepared for that we have to take steps to be prepared for that its out responsibility
3533795 i cant rule out being above the low end of the original guidance range but given the slow start this is our guidance there is a range of possible outcomes given the uncertainties out there
3533796 the shortfall from the first half is unlikely to be made up
3533797 our investment thesis is unchanged as we like the companys exposure to oil sands and mining in canada and south america
3533798 it is the essence of our business model and we expect it to remain strong
3533799 the canadian data were good as well but my sense is they pretty well just met expectations so it was a bit surprising that the canadian dollar actually strengthened against the u s dollar after the two trade reports
3533800 plus the u s trade report was exceptionally strong and i thought that would have given the u s dollar a good kick because it implies a fairly hefty upward revision to second quarter gdp growth
3533801 i guess in a relative sense we might see some improvement on the data front which could support our currency
3533802 but our general sense is the canadian dollar will likely weaken over the next year or so
3533803 we saw safe having buying in bonds because of credit market concerns following jp morgans writedown announcement
3533804 we are confident that we will be successful in making additional non dilutive transactions and strategic alliances to bring cetrorelix to phase 3 results and production launch
3533805 as a seasoned executive for many years at aeterna zentaris prof engel has gained a deep knowledge of the companys activities at all levels
3533806 we feel that his extensive expertise in drug development and commercialization as well as in strategic partnerships make him the ideal person to lead the company
3533807 we will continue to explore opportunities to raise additional non diluted funding until the end of 2008
3533808 will also endeavour to conclude a strategic partnership for the final stage of development and commercialization of this cetrorelix compound by the end of 2008
3533809 we will complete patient recruitment for our european efficacy trial in q3 2008 with results expected in the fourth quarter of 2009
3533810 will disclose the results of our safety study before the end of 2009 and we will disclose the results of our toxicity studies in 2010 we expect to file the drug application in 2010
3533811 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
3533812 after a while you can only write down so far
3533813 the natural bottom is around zero and were rapidly approaching that point
3533814 if the economy doesnt stabilize soon it will cause problems
3533815 what investors believed in the past they dont have confidence in anymore
3533816 all that stuff that happened with shia definitely didnt help things
3533817 when adrian saw isabel with shia he knew it was time to move on and made the decision to end things hes not upset and thinks isabel is a really sweet girl but theyre done

3533823 what it boils down to in the big picture is weve had a liquidity boom for 20 odd years
3533824 now the ship is turning around and were getting a liquidity contraction and thats not good for financials period
3533825 if you dont lend you dont generate profits and the bottom line gets a little slimmer every day
3533826 we have made important progress in the last six months to preserve the long term sustainable profitability of our company while working through a process to ensure fair and equitable consideration for all stakeholders
3533827 since january we successfully signed new agreements with many of our customers whose work was due to be renewed despite a challenging economic environment and the unfavourable perception created by our filing

3533836 we have been fortunate enough to have been able to carry the original dvd of the gamers at our shop alone we have sold over 175 copies it has been our honor to have helped the dead gentlemen and their little local movie that could
3533837 a critical hit original and funny a real treat for fans of both fantasy and gaming
3533838 the gamers dorkness rising is already one of the best selling products of all time on www paizo com and its not even released yet
3533839 that all of the gamers can attend but as of todays date we have confirmations of four out of the six if youve ever tried to get a gaming group together thats a great start

3533844 without just cause or reason without legal or moral justification and without a thread of proof that iraq directly threatens the security of the united states the bush administration has headed to war as i am writing this bombs are raining upon the defenseless civilians of baghdad in a continuation of a policy that has already claimed the lives of over 1 million innocent iraqi people people just like us who want democracy but find themselves cornered by a dictator on one side naked u s aggression on another and the oil beneath their country for which it appears they are to be massacred lies sanctions and cruise missiles have never created a free and just society only everyday people can do that which is why im joining the millions world wide who have stood up to oppose the bush administrations attempt to expand the u s empire at the expense of human rights at home and abroad in this spirit im releasing this song for anyone who is willing to listen i hope it not only makes us think but also inspires us to act and raise our voices
3533845 a good friend of ours said that if the same laws were applied to u s presidents as were applied to thenazis after world war ii that every single one of them every last rich white one of them fromtruman on would have been hung to death and shot and this current administration is no exception they should be hung and tried and shot as any war criminal should be but the challenges that we face they go way beyond administrations way beyond elections way beyond every four years of pulling levers way beyond that because this whole rotten system has become so vicious and cruel that in order to sustain itself it needs to destroy entire countries and profit from their reconstruction in order to survive and thats not a system that changes every four years its a system that we have to break down generation after generation after generation after generation after generation wake up
3533846 for the last eight years all weve heard about is some mysterious outside force that threatens our security and our livelihood everyday
3533847 below by clicking on the link under the animated image and lets find our voice together on the matters affecting our african brothers and sisters
3533848 whoever has no other master than himself is the disciple of a fool
3533849 i cannot recommend a site any more than this one
3533850 he is absolute in his justice seeking beautifully informational staunchly analytical and a joy to behold i consider it both a duty and a delight to keep coming back here
3533851 upon only a first and second look i d say you should read everything posted by voice of a native son
3533852 intelligentaindigena has great commentary and interesting links that will always make you leaving the site a little more wiser
3533853 an extraordinary blogger posting on news from around the world for issues dealing with oppression of any kind
3533854 he covers issues of interest to all aboriginal peoples from around the world not just native americans
3533855 i do not feel we should forfeit the traditional rights and privileges of the natives of our islands for a mere thimbleful of votes in congress that we the lovers of hawaii from long association with it should sacrifice our birthright for the greed of alien desires to remain on our shores
3533856 my favorite part of shards was cordelias struggle back home to simply go about her life
3533857 i think in barrayar cordelias true strengths came out in a hostile alien envirement where all the normal rules of conduct seem turned around she successfully manages to adapt
3533858 she may not be as strong physically as a barrayarn man but she proved conclusively she could be as ruthless
3533859 my only regret in having re read these is that im now going to have to find the time to go through the rest of the vorkosigan novels
3533860 i noticed mr m says aral reminds him of a young robert davi myself i picture more of a gregory peck
3533861 and yes i love that while aral is the man of honour and cordelia is careful and respectful of his honour in return he also recognises her honour and her worth and is careful and respectful of that
3533862 obviously i havent read all possible but in general i love the genre because it does focus typically on the people character realtionships and sociopolitical aspects simply mixing in sci fi aspects i find such stories seem more realistic and flow better
3533863 there was a brilliant juxtaposition of swords and daggers and plasma beams
3533864 betans were progressive socially and technologically when you see it through cordelias eyes it seems almost idyllic however when we are confronted with the reality of her world she found that it was in fact deluded and manipulative the converse is barrayan culture was seen as savage stuffy and antiquated but in reality was more honest and the people were more connected to one another it is little wonder that cordelia eventually made a home there
3533865 it may be a commentary on my inner psyche bothari was my favorite character his struggle with himself was both sad and touching in the end it is apparent that he is never going to be a whole person but he finds a place anyway
3533866 the other great thing about lmbs books is the humour displayed
3533867 the characters were interesting and realistic except maybe for the exceptionally crazy bothari and exceptionally sadistic vorrutyer
3533868 and while im at it for those who like the space opera genre i rather enjoyed elizabeth moons
3533869 allies horror selections finally came i was getting nervous since one book is like 700 pages
3533870 if atlantis were to run through without the long hiatus that it normal takes does this mean that the season 5 dvd set might come out sooner as well
3533871 i rarely feel like bujold stops a story cold to have to explain her world to the reader
3533872 do you have a preferred brand of chocolate or do you just go with whatever entices you at the moment
3533873 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3533874 half of all business income in the united states now ends up going through the individual tax code
3533875 what is toleration it is the natural attribute of humanity we are all formed of weakness and error let us pardon reciprocally each others folly that is the first law of nature
3533876 all the new bnettv functionalities have been designed to create a compelling advantage and service for subscribers that will help minimize churn and maximize revenue
3533877 zara is possibly the most innovative and devastating retailer in the world
3533878 so called fast fashion is now common in the high street
3533879 but before zara arrived in the uk in 1999 all retailers offered three or four seasons zara introduces new stock every week which caught our stores on the hop
3533880 zara has absolute control of the design manufacturing and distribution process
3533881 fifty per cent of its product is made in spain 26 per cent in the rest of europe and 24 per cent elsewhere with others 50 per cent or more is made in asia fast fashion items roughly half its sales are made in company owned factories in galicia its the basic t shirt staples that are outsourced
3533882 its offshoot chains such as bershka massimo dutti and uterque which offer higher end fashion and homeware havent been so successful
3533883 nikki blonsky was the victim of an unprovoked attack by the goldens
3533884 unlike the others id do anything im not the same i have no shame
3533885 its not a question of people who are already overweight becoming clumsy because the majority of these children werent any heavier than their peers
3533886 it was assumed that all the neurological complications associated with obesity were consequences of obesity itself this suggests thats not the case

3533893 abortion ends more black lives than heart disease cancer accidents aids and violent crime combined african americans constitute little more than 12 percent of the population but have more than a third 37 percent of abortions that rate has held relatively constant though in some regions the numbers are much starker in mississippi black women receive some 72 percent of all abortions according to the centers for disease control nationwide 512 out of every 1 000 black pregnancies end in an abortion revealingly enough roughly 80 percent of planned parenthoods abortion centers are in or near minority communities

3533898 how things use to be when they were growing up
3533899 the hayes family is comfortable with dr kraus recommendation to not conduct an autopsy
3533900 it has to be health care thats as good as legislators receive it has to be affordable and available to everyone and has to be done by the end of 2009
3533901 it is a political document it is an agreement of principles and i think we have full coincidence of principles
3533902 these are temporary arrangements now but later it should be replaced by international process
3533903 people are going online to get information about all sorts of things including chronic diseases
3533904 it just made sense to create an online educational resource to give patients information in a manner that they are used to searching for
3533905 these particular topics really resonated with people living with crohns disease
3533906 these are really key lifestyle issues for things they are dealing on a daily basis
3533907 in the future we will certainly look for opportunities to make the podcasts widely available
3533908 because we are in a regulated environment we can only operate within a certain amount of space but as we continue to get response and feedback we will look at comments in the future we want to get comments back from people
3533909 he did have a pretty infectious laugh he was also a prankster you had to watch him you didnt want to mess with him because hed get you back
3533910 he was just an incredible courageous example of a man
3533911 he had a courage and a strength about him that he just didnt let the cancer dictate what he was going to do
3533912 joe had a unique perspective on life joe just had an incredible wit he had an encouraging spirit he was patient kind and gentle
3533913 he was the model person for when we were considering hiring someone for a service manger position at one of our other stores
3533914 we would compare the applicant to how joe does it here in huntington beach he set the standard for the service department
3533915 oh thats right i have to req you a computer

3533919 these days british shoppers are becoming more discerning about the jewellery that they buy and are now prepared to pay more for a really good quality piece that stands out from the crowd
3533920 but all that glitters isnt gold in fact it is platinum jewellery that is the real shining star what is more there is a real trend towards more original and distinctive pieces
3533921 there is a strong trend towards bold individual pieces to express personal style and even bespoke pieces of jewellery are becoming more popular
3533922 long gone are the days of women having to hunt down wealthy men to get their hands on a nice trinket or two as over one in five 22 per cent of british ladies say that they are happy to treat themselves to precious metal jewellery

3533925 with a team of developers from multiple companies around the world contributing weve continued to make the imedia browser even more useful than ever
3533926 we continue to receive comments from mac users who appreciate the ability to quickly access their media libraries using the imedia browser as a standalone application or as an embedded part of their favorite applications
3533927 previous versions of fotomagico used their own proprietary version of ilife integration keeping up with all the changes used to be a lot of work this has gotten much easier since we migrated to karelias imedia framework since its open source and a lot of developers are contributing to it it gets updated quickly when the media repositories change
3533928 examine the letter section of local newspapers or listen in on commentary on a m radio talk shows and the emergence of a new group of people becomes visible folks who openly dislike bicycle riders as the number of bicyclists and their perceived political muscle has increased more and more citizens have come forward to denounce boorish illegal elitist rude and or threatening behavior of bicyclists unfortunately this backlash to the bicycle movement has made its way into the jury box since jurors are drawn from voter and driver license lists people on juries tend to include folks who are able to leave their jobs or home routines and serve for as long as a case takes to finish juries are composed of people who reflect area demographics and attitudes the majority of jurors identify with car drivers and do not ride bicycles in traffic

3533930 to treat other human beings like that is simply appalling
3533931 i rented the property to a romanian guy last week the windows were put in and the bin got burned he was really scared and just left and is living in a hostel now
3533932 the vast majority of people in the area are very welcoming and recognise that people living there are also working in the hospital nearby going to the university and contributing to the economy
3533933 you cannot say no foreigners you cannot say english speakers only the law is absolutely clear
3533934 i am renting this property without prejudice to anyone in the whole wide world
3533935 but please be aware there are a number of criteria suitable candidates must pass before being eligible to rent this property
3533936 look ill give you whatever support you need including staying completely away from you
3533937 the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feeling and expression lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects
3533938 hey heres a sample code snippet i found that doesnt compile anymore now that ive hacked it up can you fix it for me
3533939 can you just google it for me and tell me the answer
3533940 psst whatd you put for 21 on the fill in the blank section and 22 23 and 24 what about them
3533941 can i just turn in your essay and you write a different one and turn that in
3533942 i definitely think there is some middle ground these days
3533943 because at the end of the day who really gives a shit about what your pet peeves are
3533944 but taken to the extreme how does that make sense to anyone
3533945 this is another exciting development for tesco it complements our entries into china and the united states giving us access to another of the most important economies in the world
3533946 the north american investors know the professional side of the business well and have got their heads around the markets division but then in london we trade at around a 20pc discount
3533947 it is a bit puzzling why there is such a large discount as a share in one place is exactly economically equal to another
3533948 fall off a cliff the way it did in 2002 03
3533949 marks a really important writer to us artists are clamouring to work with him at the moment and as a result this is one of those deals that all the publishers were looking to get
3533950 guy and the team at emi have been nothing but supportive of me throughout my career helping me to develop creatively and having the foresight to introduce me to artists such as amy winehouse and many others im very happy to be able to continue my relationship with the company
3533951 a considerable number of brands are downsizing in this way but most customers are savvy and companies should realise that their corporate reputation could suffer
3533952 the decision was brought about by our need to raise wholesale prices and retailers desire to continue to offer strongbow in a similar party pack format at the same price point
3533953 we seek to keep our confectionery affordable to offer value for money and therefore we have slightly reduced the size on some of the larger sharing packs
3533954 fundamentally the only reason we were involved in commercial property development was because we had free cashflow to invest in the market that market has now changed meaning it is no longer attractive
3533955 there is a feeling among shopkeepers here that we are not happy
3533956 the obvious thing is that this will create unemployment tesco is saying that it will open cash and carry stores but there is every chance in the years to come that it is going to open its own retail stores and then jobs will go
3533957 we have a lot of western retailers here around 15pc of the citys small shops have closed this year and lots of shopkeepers are looking for new businesses where they dont have to work in the shadow of giants
3533958 tesco and wal mart are here and that is a good thing for the market it would have been nice to be here before but you cant have everything
3533959 only 13pc of the population can afford to shop in a modern retail store
3533960 however the long term trends for the travel industry remain positive
3533961 medvedevs decision to halt military operations triggered some frenzied buying
3533962 there has also been some institutional money sitting on the sidelines waiting for the moment to commit and the news headline provided it
3533963 with policy advice technical assistance and if needed financial support using available imf facilities

3533972 tatkala as syaikh ahmad an najmi hadir bersama kedua pamannya hasan dan husein an najmi di madrasah as salafiyah di shaamithah tahun 1359 hijriyah umur beliau saat itu 13 tahun namun beliau mampu mendengarkan dan memahami pelajaran pelajaran yang disampaikan oleh as syaikh abdullah kepada murid murid seniornya dan beliau benar benar menghafal pelajaran pelajaran tersebut
3533973 inilah yang menyebabkan as syaikh abdullah menggabungkannya pada halaqah kibaar yang beliau tangani sendiri pengajarannya beliau melihat bagaimana kepandaiannya kecepatan hafalannya dan kecerdasannya
3533974 barang siapa yang melihat sesuatu ia benci dari pemimpinnya maka hendaknya ia bersabar atasnya karena barang siapa yang meninggalkan jamaah dengan sejengkal lalu ia mati kecuali ia akan mati seperti matinya orang jahiliyyah
3533975 cara yang bagus merupakan sarana terbesar diterimanya kebenaran sedang cara yang keliru dan kasar merupakan sarana yang paling berbahaya ditolaknya dan tidak diterimanya kebenaran atau bisa mengobarkan kekacauan kezhaliman permusuhan dan saling menyerang dikategorikan dalam permasalahan ini apa yang dikerjakan oleh sebagian orang berupa demonstrasi yang menyebabkan keburukan yang banyak bagi para dai maka berkonvoi di jalan jalan dan berteriak bukanlah merupakan jalan untuk memperbaiki dan dakwah jadi cara yang benar adalah dengan menziarahi pemerintah menyuratinya dengan cara yang bagus nasihatilah para pemimpin pemerintah dan kepala suku dengan metode seperti ini bukan dengan cara kekerasan dan demonstrasi nabi shollallahu alaihi wasallam ketika tinggal di makkah selama 13 tahun beliau tidaklah pernah menggunakan demonstrasi dan berkonvoi serta tidak mengancam orang lain untuk menghancurkan harta bendanya dan membunuh mereka tak ragu lagi cara ini akan membahayakan dakwah dan para dai akan menghalangi tersebarnya dakwah membuat para pemimpin teras memusuhinya dan melawannya dengan segala yang mungkin bisa dilakukannya mereka para pelaku demo menginginkan kebaikan dengan cara seperti tersebut akan tetapi malah terjadi yang sebaliknya maka hendaknya seorang dai ilallah menempuh jalannya para rasul dan pengikutnya sekalipun memakan waktu yang panjang itu lebih utama dibandingkan perbuatan yang membahayakan dan mempersempit ruang gerak dakwah atau dihabisi walaa haula walaa quwwata illa billah
3533976 apakah demonstrasi yang dilakukan oleh kaum pria dan wanita melawan pemerintah bisa dianggap termasuk sarana dakwah apakah orang yang meninggal di dalamnya dianggap mati syahid

3533989 semua umatku akan masuk surga kecuali yang enggan para shahabat bertanya siapakah gerangan yang enggan itu jawab beliau orang yang taat kepadaku dia masuk surga dan yang durhaka kepadaku maka sungguh dialah orang yang enggan itu
3533990 aku tinggalkan kepada kalian dua perkara kalian tidak akan tersesat selama kalian berpegang dengannya yaitu kitabullah dan sunnahku

3533996 maka demi tuhanmu mereka pada hakekatnya tidak beriman hingga mereka menjadikan kamu hakim terhadap perkara yang mereka perselisihkan kemudian mereka tidak merasa dalam hati mereka sesuatu keberatan terhadap putusan yang kamu berikan dan mereka menerima dengan sepenuhnya
3533997 dan janganlah kamu mengikuti apa yang kamu tidak mempunyai pengetahuan tentangnya sesungguhnya pendengaran penglihatan dan hati semuanya itu akan dimintai pertanggung jawabannya

3534042 in the way that skepticism is sometimes applied to issues of public concern there is a tendency to belittle to condescend to ignore the fact that deluded or not supporters of superstition and pseudoscience are human beings with real feelings who like the skeptics are trying to figure out how the world works and what our role in it might be their motives are in many cases consonant with science if their culture has not given them all the tools they need to pursue this great quest let us temper our criticism with kindness none of us comes fully equipped

3534053 despite the challenging trading market our unique portfolio is showing relatively good liquidity
3534054 it needs to continue to reduce debt levels to protect it against a more dramatic downturn in the uk residential market than we predict and afford it the headroom to expand through acquisitions once market conditions are right to do so

3534070 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3534071 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3534072 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3534073 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

3534075 i might have to consider staying black tie for the rest of our games
3534076 it was good for us to have a tough test early in the playoffs
3534077 we have a bullseye on our back as the undefeated no 1 seed but we embrace the bullseye and that showed today i think this was a statement win in terms of showing the league we here not just to go undefeated in the regular season but to go all the way
3534078 i dont think they could have beaten us even if they had recruited four varsity players shaq and moses
3534079 we proved to ourselves that we can bounce back under pressure and execute
3534080 we are playing amazingly well together for a church league team if we keep playing the way we are playing the only thing that can stop us is ourselves im really excited to see what we can do the rest of the season
3534081 i just knew we were going to win and i was pretty proud they both hit rim and didnt look too ugly
3534082 i would say at least twice as good as everybody in the league we should have named our team the 95 96 chicago bulls or something
3534083 i wanted to call a timeout when the lead was only 12 9
3534084 but i was so mad i didnt even want to talk to them
3534085 we would have scored 100 if we didnt come out flat
3534086 i think if we had approached it as a normal game we would have done better but now worries
3534087 were not hanging our heads theres no shame in losing to that team
3534088 we lost to a superior team they have superior talent superior coaching superior shooting and frankly they are just better than we are
3534089 we were out classed on the basketball court in almost every way tonight its a moral victory for us in that we lost by only two points
3534090 i admit i played a bad game including probably 10 missed layups
3534091 when i drive to the basket i expect someone to go backdoor
3534092 were not the new york knicks or something its all done in a positive manner were just working to get better
3534093 well all i can say is that we got our expletive packed
3534094 whatever term the jesps choose to use thats what happened
3534095 im kind of like that guy on the pittsburgh steelers who guaranteed they would beat new england
3534096 i talked a lot of expletive but i just didnt back it up at all they were way better than us
3534097 after all the trash talking that took place before tonight i really wanted to come out and send a message right away
3534098 we cant lose we couldve let them play 5 on 0 for the whole first half and we still wouldve killed them
3534099 but i must admit i probably had even more fun just sitting back relaxing and watching our guys go to work it was like poetry in motion out there

3534159 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
3534160 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
3534161 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
3534162 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
3534163 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
3534164 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
3534165 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
3534166 the securities brokerage business increasingly demands size and scale and hrbfa simply did not have the size to be able to compete at the highest levels in the future this transaction will give the hrbfa financial advisors a dynamic parent company with a growing platform so that they can compete effectively and efficiently at the same time the transaction will benefit block shareholders as we reduce risk in a noncore area and enhance our returns on capital when this transaction closes we will have completed the strategic realignment that we promised shareholders and our efforts will be tightly focused on our tax services business that serves more than 23 million clients
3534167 todays announcement is very positive for hrbfa which will move forward as part of a highly rated and well respected organization our advisors will benefit from increased breadth of product offerings ameriprise financials scale and the strong advisor support and technology that they offer
3534168 local businesses like divers direct and holiday inn rely really depend on a healthy ecosystem to sustain tourism divers tend to be a population of nature lovers to begin with so when you combine this passion with our livelihood depending on the environment its really clear that we must prioritize marine health
3534169 a lot of people arent aware that reefs provide many benefits beyond scuba diving snorkeling and fishing in addition to the many ecological benefits that the reefs provide to south florida they can impact everyone by acting as a barrier between the mainland and hurricanes and other ocean phenomena such as tsunamis

3534173 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3534174 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3534175 what would it look like after it had been moved
3534176 either write something worth reading or do something worth writing
3534177 his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3534178 the right knows obama is unelectable except perhaps against attila the hun
3534179 regardless of the sex of the candidates most americans in essence see the president as the
3534180 this circular firing squad that is occurring is unattractive unprofessional unconscionable and unacceptable
3534181 i joined the unit more or less agnostic on drugs policy being personally opposed to drug use but open minded about the best way to deal with the problem
3534182 i was certainly not inclined to decriminalise however during my time in the unit as i saw more and more evidence of what works to quote new labours mantra of the time it became apparent to me that enforcement and supply side interventions were largely pointless they have no significant lasting impact on the availability affordability or use of drugs
3534183 i think what was truly depressing about my time in ukadcu was that the overwhelming majority of professionals i met including those from the police the health service the government and voluntary sectors held the same view the illegality of drugs causes far more problems for society and the individual than it solves yet publicly all those intelligent knowledgeable people were forced to repeat the nonsensical mantra that the government would be tough on drugs even though they all knew the governments policy was actually causing harm
3534184 tobacco is a legal drug whose use is declining and precisely because it is legal its users are far more amenable to government control education programmes and taxation
3534185 the idea that many people are holding back solely because of a law which they know is already unenforceable is simply ridiculous
3534186 julian critchley is one of the brave few to tell the truth about the failure of prohibition and the need to replace it with a system of regulation
3534187 it is truly shameful that there are so many more who know that the war on drugs is overwhelmingly counterproductive and yet continue to remain silent tacitly endorsing a policy that they know creates misery degradation and death for millions across the globe
3534188 there is little chance the mpc will cut rates in the next few months and indeed there remains a near term risk that the mpc will hike rates if inflation expectations surge higher again
3534189 the rise in core inflation will clearly leave the mpc concerned that even the sharp slowdown in activity now under way will not be severe enough to prevent a more broad based pick up in inflation while we still think that the mpc could cut interest rates before the end of the year a cut within the next couple of months looks well off the agenda indeed a rate rise is still a possibility
3534190 the most important concern up and down the country is the deteriorating state of our economy hundreds of thousands of families now have the threat of negative equity hanging over them businesses are cutting back unemployment is creeping up and this mornings inflation figures are yet another worrying signal for families desperately trying to make ends meet
3534191 its very clear that were in for a dose of stagflation with the economy slowing abruptly and inflation too high and increasing
3534192 i think everybody recognises that it is not possible for governments to fully insulate whether it is households or businesses from these kinds of world oil prices that we have seen
3534193 it was frankly a mess it was crammed floor to ceiling with art works they were stuffed under the bed over every surface
3534194 the smaller the items were the more likely they were to have been stolen
3534195 it is vital the cica understands that women are not responsible for mens criminality because they have a drink or for any other reason
3534196 nobody would suggest that if someones wallet was stolen after having a drink then their compensation should be reduced
3534197 as far as we in the government are concerned a victim of rape is not in any way at all culpable due to alcohol consumption
3534198 as i understand it the cica have accepted that the guidelines were being misapplied i hope that the compensation authority will look at these other cases that they believe may also have had the guidelines misinterpreted and review them without the victims themselves having to go back and ask for that review
3534199 if an applicant accepts our decision then that case is finalised and closed
3534200 if they wish to ask for a review they must do this themselves in writing
3534201 contributed to the circumstances which gave rise to the injury
3534202 old prejudices like if a woman is wearing a short skirt or acting in a certain way are still operational
3534203 by reducing compensation because a woman has been drinking the cica is operating under those old prejudices
3534204 the scheme was originally applied wrongly in this case but this was corrected at review and the award was paid in full
3534205 it is not our policy to reduce the level of award to a victim of rape due to alcohol consumption this supports our view that a victim of rape is not in anyway culpable due to alcohol consumption
3534206 a victim of rape should not have any compensation reduced because of their drinking i hope that the compensation authority will look at these other cases
3534207 and when he was at the place he said unto them pray that ye enter not into temptation

3534227 restaurants voluntarily began to make nutritional information available years ago because we recognized that many of our customers wanted it
3534228 but our patrons want a choice in accessing the information rather than the government determining how when and where they receive the information
3534229 this poll confirms that activists groups supporting the menu labeling only approach are out of step with the public
3534230 the public is accessing information in many different and more useful ways and does not support legislation or local ordinances that restrict their access to this information
3534231 restaurants are constantly researching and talking to their patrons its the nature of our industry to respond to and reflect the preferences of our customers
3534232 up until now the chiropractic profession has had limited choices when it comes to emr

3534245 by the conlanging community we at the conlang wikibook want to help you make the language that youd like to make not the one that you already speak
3534246 about all we can say right now is that the boeing tanker team met with dod officials to discuss our comments on the draft rfp and gain further clarity in how the requirements and evaluation criteria have changed since the initial competition
3534247 any decision on boeings path forward would be premature and further speculation would be counter productive
3534248 boeing remains committed to providing the air force with a next generation tanker that meets real world mission requirements and that is selected through a fair open and unbiased competition that follows a realistic timetable
3534249 it is clear that the defense department met the concerns raised by the government accountability office and the draft amendment to the kc x tanker request for proposals addresses those concerns by clarifying but not altering the tanker requirements and specifications
3534250 it is also clear that the department recognizes the need to begin production on the next generation of aerial refueling tankers as quickly as possible we look forward to submitting our proposal

3534255 the urea bull run continues with india buying big volumes and likely to continue doing so until the end of the year replacement urea to the uk should now be priced at 520 per tonne though we have some in stock that can be offered at a discount
3534256 nitrate prices have moved up again following the lead from the urea market and uk manufacturers now have 400 per tonne firmly in their sights imported ammonium nitrate remains a very cost effective replacement although shipments remain slow as product continues to be sold into more lucrative destinations

3534349 wives submit to your own husbands as to the lord for the husband is the head of the wife as also christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore just as the church is subject to christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything
3534350 husbands love your wives just as christ also loved the church and gave himself for her that he might sanctify and cleanse her with the washing of water by the word that he might present her to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that she should be holy and without blemish so husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies he who loves his wife loves himself for no one ever hated his own flesh but nourishes and cherishes it just as the lord loves the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones for this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife and the two shall become one flesh this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ and the church nevertheless let each one of you in particular so love his own wife as himself and let the wife see that she respects her husband

3534353 he threw the bag at me and pointed and he had the gun like that
3534354 i think he can be a very dangerous person there is no doubt about that
3534355 hes an absconder he is wanted he has the potential to be dangerous he had made several threats to a lot of people that were involved in the case and had been involved in the case since then
3534356 what it does is it requires businesses across the state of texas to either shred erase or otherwise make unreadable any kind of sensitive personal information of their customers
3534357 what information in these files are you supposed to protect
3534358 client name and the results and that they were here at all we dont even acknowledge they were here
3534359 the only way you could get to look at their records is under a direct judges order
3534360 this is stuff we found we found a box full of files in your dumpster with these type of files in them can you tell me what these are
3534361 this causes us serious concern what youve shown us are records that have very private information in them records that are confidential and certainly nothing that we would release
3534362 disposal of the records is set on a time frame at the end of the time frame they are supposed to be destroyed
3534363 it is not business as usual anymore with the russians and there are consequences for doing what they are doing
3534364 one of the things that has been holding me back was needing to feel like everything was in place more or less before i took the time to exercise i felt like i had to have time to exercise nope ive got to make time i know but now i know what that really means it means making time to do it regardless of the chaos around me i am now starting to visualize a messy house not too hard a stack of piles waiting for me and me exercising anyway and then tacking all that stuff after ive exercised
3534365 most consecutive top ten entries in the uk by a female group
3534366 the rest of the girls have said theyre right behind me which is really important for me as it will be weird to be on the other side of the fence this time so whilst we get started on the next album it will be brilliant to be a judge on the x factor
3534367 how can something boring be successful in social media well there is really no product service or topic that cannot be successful in social media marketing if you are willing to rumor additional cuts coming to yahoo
3534368 the supplier is not responsible for any maintenance if x happens
3534369 michael page is a jewel in the professional business and the management is also very great our objective is to do a friendly approach
3534370 i cant say how much we are willing to spend we have always said we can leverage our balance sheet to 1bn 785m and we have roughly 400m in shares available whatever we do we will remain financially disciplined
3534371 i think its now a question of price adecco has clearly shown its interest in the company and if the price is right investors in michael page are more likely to agree
3534372 however adecco has said that it wanted to pursue acquisition targets with strict discipline and not over pay so i wouldnt expect anything to happen in the short term bolt ons would be more suitable for adecco but michael page is an excellent company
3534373 at the current rate borrowing is more attractive than saving
3534374 the idea that the real cost of money is zero is usually founded on the idea that peoples incomes are rising at a relatively fast rate but at the moment wage growth is not high enough by itself
3534375 a constitutional change to eliminate the right of same sex couples to marry
3534376 once again the people of california are held hostage by a tyrannical judicial system determined to implement a radical social agenda
3534377 it is shameful that activist judges and politicians are throwing every obstacle they can in the way of restoring the true definition of marriage
3534378 this morning three just judges recognized that parents have the fundamental right to educate their children at home
3534379 and its a good thing homeschooling is still legal in california because parents will be yanking their children out of government schools teaching homosexual marriage is natural and normal
3534380 despite the opposition of our traditional marriage opposing judges and politicians

3534383 ive always felt like we have the best fans in the nfl and that they would support our team regardless of how they feel about myself or brett or management or whatever
3534384 but it was a great reception when we took the field
3534385 its been an interesting last month but i think our team has gotten pretty tight
3534386 the support from our teammates throughout the day today was definitely encouraging
3534387 i was just hoping i was going the right direction
3534388 it took them to the eighth inning to really pull away and its one of those things where you have to tip your hat to the better team
3534389 medford is a good team playing its best baseball of the season
3534390 medford is a very good representative for the state of oregon and we wish them the best of luck
3534391 all year long we had people come up big in situations
3534392 everybody did their part we came up a little short but im very proud of them the community should be proud of what theyve accomplished
3534393 weve had a running battle with the canadians for years
3534394 the canadians have a tremendous leg up in the industry
3534395 you have to look at them on a case by case basis
3534396 when you lose a race like that it motivates me even more to try to swim faster
3534397 i just wanted to be out at the 50 meter point and thats where i was
3534398 i was in open water and it was difficult for the other guys to see me
3534399 i knew park is strong in the last 50 meters
3534400 so i knew i had to be fast and concentrated
3534401 i just tried to swim my own race hes going to go out but i cant let that affect my race strategy
3534402 to be tied for the most olympic golds of all time with those names in olympic history
3534403 the olympics have been around for so many years thats a pretty amazing accomplishment
3534404 i set up an opportunity to have a perfect swim tomorrow
3534405 it might be once in a century you see something like this
3534406 hes not just winning hes absolutely destroying everything its awesome to watch
3534407 its his physical ability its his ability to race its his ability to keep focused to get excited when he needs to and to come down when he needs to come down
3534408 im so glad to have this race behind me because theres so much pressure
3534409 i tried to keep myself as mentally strong as possible
3534410 last year in melbourne at the world championships one swim started it and then swims just started happening one after another after another we had a great morning this morning and hopefully we can set up some more good swims tonight and keep the ball rolling
3534411 it almost felt like less pressure because it wasnt initially my event
3534412 i dont think its necessarily fair what happened but rules are rules and im just doing what im told
3534413 i just wanted to win my heat and set everything up for tomorrow
3534414 just get through that and prepare myself for tomorrow thats the most important thing an afternoon off and its time to just sort of get as rested as i can recover and i probably have to re shave get all of that stuff down
3534415 i guess they are going for clean cut and boring when i do release mine and i am tempted to do it on the same day this would be the bigger hit if they change their minds im waiting
3534416 i do think they could have waited a bit if they want a worldwide hit i have them all up here pointing to her beehive
3534417 nobody takes a minute off on the internet you have to be there every minute of the day looking and hunting for the next big story so you have to make it work for you and here i am with my laptop and my wireless card looking to break more stories before i finish my breakfast than perez does in a week
3534418 you are now the head of the television department which is comprised solely of you
3534419 like the original series it is a procedural chronicling the workings of the fictional hawaiian state police department in the original the unit was headed by steve mcgarrett played by jack lord in the new series mcgarretts son chris will be the top cop
3534420 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
3534421 although it is not true that all conservatives are stupid people it is true that most stupid people are conservative
3534422 stopping russia the us and its allies must unite against moscows war on georgia
3534423 this is a grave challenge to the united states and europe
3534424 the united states and its nato allies must together impose a price on russia
3534425 the things that were happening in kosovo the things that were happening in iraq we are now following the same path the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america
3534426 we are raising our five year compound annual growth rate cagr objectives for total revenue to three percent to four percent and ebitda to 3
3534427 we continue to hit or exceed the challenging targets we set ourselves back in november 2005 subject to any significant regulatory outcomes we remain on track to achieve our core long term management objective of 6 000 to 7 000 million of free cash flow in fiscal 2010
3534428 mobile data growth of 44 1 percent has been the major driver with 588k wireless broadband subscribers at june 2008 as additions remain at the rate of approximately 20k per month
3534429 it spend is the largest component of the program and will remain so as the it transformation continues
3534430 our complex five year transformation continues to be on track
3534431 the code is deployed and running at scale and this has all been achieved without breaking our central commitment that there should be no interruption to either our customers or the wider business we have seen no increase in complaint volumes and all billing accuracy and revenue assurance metrics are equal between the new and legacy systems
3534432 this is one of the worlds largest and most complex it transformations and will allow telstra to provide all of its customers from private consumers to large corporates an unparalleled customer experience the telstra experience
3534433 swearing and using slurs in the background and the nose of things being broken
3534434 what we have here clearly is an overt attempt an overzealous attempt by the police department to carry out the vendetta
3534435 they asked me on the telephone who do i rent from where was mr gresham
3534436 they threatened to take my baby away if i didnt give up some information about mr gresham
3534437 maybe they female soccer players just loosen up because it is soccer thats pretty much the same reason why most anything i like is good because i like it

3534441 the boys were all playing together and they were all about the same age ranging from 8 to 11
3534442 at this point we think its just accidental no hazing thats what people immediately think when you think of someone being wrapped up to a pole and burnt but it appears that was not the case
3534443 in almost every case he has rounded up his dogs and beetled off
3534444 it wasnt working out adrian saw her with shia and that was kind of it the crash their hanging out he obviously didnt appreciate it
3534445 it goes all the way up to the mayor im the person responsible
3534446 we found more than 200 people in the program who are not residents of d c and 104 who are over the age of 50
3534447 russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
3534448 i think it is important at this point for all sides to show restraint and to stop this armed conflict
3534449 john mccain is going to be saying i know what i am talking about foreign policy and im tough enough to lead
3534450 barack obama is going to be saying i know what i am talking about in foreign policy and im nuanced enough that i am not going shooting from the hip the way john mccain does
3534451 they must be very cautious in being used by a party in this very explosive situation
3534452 the initial mccain statement seemed very overheated as not one of extreme caution
3534453 semangat tim sudah bagus tim kami bermain bagus dan suporter memberi dukungan maksimal maka saya sangat puas dengan hasil ini
3534454 kami butuh latihan lebih keras sebab seperti yang kita lihat serangan kami kkurang tajam meski banyak peluang selain itu slavia pasti akan tampil lebih garang di kandangnya nanti
3534455 there are costs to adapting to climate change by planning now we can reduce our exposure to weather related events
3534456 in order to manage any problem first you have to measure it
3534457 in god we trust everybody else has to bring data
3534458 having more people affected in subways on hot days causing more delays
3534459 we and the mdc headed by mutambara have signed the agreement mr tsvangirai did not sign the agreement because he is basically trying to take us back to renegotiate issues that we had already agreed on
3534460 we are proceeding and the president is going to form a government of national unity including members of the opposition
3534461 the talks have not collapsed its just a time out break
3534462 the president has said they have not collapsed and that is the position
3534463 we and the mdc headed by mutambara have signed the agreement
3534464 dependemos de que llueva en agosto y mediados de septiembre para recuperar los niveles ptimos y operar tranquilamente
3534465 how can this be what is this strange thing you speak of
3534466 this is incredible i have to survive central park needs me
3534467 was recording studios without any room reverb or ambience the playing room at windmill lane studios was designed to be totally dead and you can hear it on the drums it wasnt until the boy sessions that we figured out that we had to pull the drum kit into the entrance hall after the receptionist had gone home to get a decent drum sound with its three story stairwell and stone and tiled surfaces it was a great live room
3534468 it didnt sit well with us not being there but we were callow 18 year olds and steve a veteran of many great records so we let him do it his way its a great mix but it was too acoustic guitar heavy for us
3534469 it was obvious to everyone that we were driving with two wheels over the edge of the cliff and it drew from us and particularly bono a level of creativity that we had not seen before
3534470 out of this situational scrimmage we got a couple of two minute drills that were pretty dynamic
3534471 we got some short yardage and goal line work we got a lot of third down work which i thought was good the offense made some big plays to move the ball down the field and then turned it over on a forced error by the defense all in all there was a little bit more give and take in this scrimmage than on saturday the one glaring thing is we have to find somebody who can run the football the loss of requan boyette for the time being has put a damper on our run game

3534478 were quite upset as well this is not how we have our protocol set up with our producers
3534479 they have to deal with large scale suppliers the infrastructure of that supply mechanism has the same potential for contamination as conventional meat
3534480 we tend to look at whole foods not only as more nutritious but also safer and were willing to pay a premium for that
3534481 i must say im not surprised to see a single incident
3534482 if it became a regular occurrence like it is with conventional beef i think wed be extremely concerned

3534513 the editor of newsweek jon meacham said he had not read the manuscript but he offered a reason why the media might be silent i think theres a kind of bush bashing fatigue out there
3534514 americans just cant believe an american president would engage in conduct that smacks of such criminality and thus the whole notion of taking the president to court for murder is a revolutionary one
3534515 if you say our young men didnt die for bush cheney and rove then whom did they die for
3534516 what i strongly believe without absolutely knowing is that this man has no respect or love for this country
3534517 i dont know about you but if i ever killed just one person even accidentally like in a car accident id never have another perfect day as long as i lived
3534518 bushs alleged crime is on such a grand scale that it would greatly dishonor those who paid the ultimate price because of it if he were not to pay the ultimate penalty
3534519 very credible argument could be made that in a real sense he did intend to have american soldiers killed in his war
3534520 not only didnt the defendant intend to kill but he had no way of knowing whether someone would die or not but while bush never specifically intended to kill any american soldier he absolutely knew american soldiers would necessarily die in his war
3534521 therefore a case could be made that unless bush intended to have a war without any casualties which is an argument that would make bush sound absurd he did in fact specifically intend to have american soldiers killed
3534522 as a former prosecutor with twenty one murder convictions without a loss i am probably in a better position than the average person to know what type of evidence is necessary to go to trial with

3534538 the proposed regulations will continue to protect species while focusing the consultation process on those federal actions where potential impacts can be linked to the action and the risks are reasonably certain to occur
3534539 the result should be a process that is less time consuming and a more effective use of our resources
3534540 it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3534541 with these changes the bush administration threatens to undo more than 30 years of progress
3534542 these changes take unbiased professional wildlife biologists out of the equation and put decisions in the hands of political appointees
3534543 gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3534544 repeats and includes all of the disdain for science and political trumping of expertise that has characterized previous bush administration efforts to dismantle fundamental environmental laws
3534545 there will always be criticism any time you suggest changes to the endangered species act
3534546 collaboration with besang on 3d ic development demonstrates the expert technical capability of nnfc and the commercialization of emerging semiconductor technologies we expect that besangs breakthrough 3d ic technology will provide ultimate low cost and high performance solutions for the semiconductor industry
3534547 i am pleased that besangs 3d ic development is the first success story of excellent collaboration and technology exchange between snf and nnfc
3534548 one of unique features of besangs 3d ic is the capability of unrestricted 3d interconnections using conventional via technologies that does not require wafer alignment nor through silicon vias for 3d interconnects
3534549 conventional cmos technology is facing its scaling limits therefore this emerging 3d ic technology will extend the lifespan of cmos technology because it is an excellent alternative way to accommodate more devices on a given wafer area
3534550 besangs 3d ic is a novel combination of short process steps formation of array blocks in 3d thin layer transfer using unique wafer bonding followed by low temperature processing
3534551 hence there is a high possibility for this breakthrough 3d ic to provide low cost manufacturing solutions for the semiconductor industry besangs 3d ic is a very attractive technology and one wonders why other companies have not thought about it however i always believe in the dynamics of small companies as my colleague dawon kahng and i worked as a small team within a large organization when we co invented the non volatile memory in 1967 at bell labs
3534552 we can imagine evolution of semiconductor technologies through 3d vertical stacking instead of conventional horizontal shrinking which is getting more expensive and facing ever more technical difficulties
3534553 for rapid wafer processing engineers at nnfc and students and staff members at snf reserved the tools for besang with such strong support from nnfc and snf besang has successfully reached this level of technology development in a very short time i would like to say special thanks to all at nnfc and snf
3534554 nanotechnology is a great example it has the potential to advance medicine agriculture health and environmental science and provide great benefits to society but there may be safety concerns related to the special properties of nanoparticles such as their greater abilities to penetrate and move across organs and cells in biological systems
3534555 the u s oversight system currently relies on agencies and regulations designed for related technologies but they are not equipped to adequately handle the novel properties and unique challenges associated with nanotechnology in fact oversight issues associated with applications for agriculture and food remain largely unexplored
3534556 to meet the needs and values of all stakeholders involved we must consider new technologies from a variety of perspectives for example some stakeholders are more concerned about the economic benefits of new technology while others care primarily about the health and environmental impact
3534557 our goal was to develop a multidisciplinary approach to more comprehensively evaluate oversight systems for emerging technologies
3534558 we anticipate that this new approach will be a valuable tool for analyzing multiple perspectives features outcomes and tradeoffs of oversight systems
3534559 such an approach that incorporates the viewpoints of key disciplines and the perspectives of multiple stakeholders could help to ameliorate controversy and conflict as new technologies emerge and oversight systems for them are considered and deployed

3534562 the fire alarm sounded at about 6 30pm and we were evacuated for about 40 minutes
3534563 this then has a negative effect on new investment so i do not see these events contributing to a growth in online distribution
3534564 consumers are much more reluctant to pay directly online it is also a restricted market protecting local companies and this restricts the introduction of foreign advanced technologies or innovative foreign disruptive technology in the next few years the business2business environment will be firmly engaged in online distribution and procurement of product the most significant change will be in the way hotel product in china is distributed
3534565 the trouble that some travel companies and hotels find themselves in due to the slowdown will drive consolidation and alliances in the months to come which will have an impact on the sector
3534566 hopefully hotels will learn from the experience of the olympics not to rely on large scale events and inflated rates but to follow a path of smart distribution strategy through multiple channels and multiple markets more otas and online consolidators are entering as enabling technology becomes more accessible and cheaper for chinese hotels
3534567 the gds market will have to be regulated although i do not believe the government will relinquish complete control more likely they will announce further alliances with major international gds to provide new technology and further inventory for travelsky the chinese monopoly gds more airline consolidation is also expected in china as airlines lose money on rising fuel costs
3534568 i think we will see mergers and acquisitions happening early in 2009 i also believe that the chinese government will announce further relaxation of protective regulation in the sector to boost the industry post olympics

3534591 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
3534592 anyone who can help us prevent this type of activity should come forward to the police
3534593 those responsible for planting these devices show a callous disregard for human life
3534594 those responsible seem intent on following their own selfish agenda and the only way for communities to be free from such activity is to help officers bring these criminals before the courts
3534595 there was no claim of responsibility but dissident republicans were suspected of being responsible the devices were being examined
3534596 formal consultation on equality impact assessment eqia of northside urban village draft regeneration framework
3534597 the dup was relentlessly trying to interfere in the uup tory talks and would not be ditching its support and links with the order

3534601 unfortunately from a republican perspective there are two different jurisdictions and two different economies and two different realities on the island
3534602 the major question historians will ask is not why the republicans surrendered but why they fought such a futile long war
3534603 it has not been unconditional surrender and it has been infinitely better than continuing to fight a futile war for the sake of honouring irelands dead yet producing only more of them but let us not labour under any illusions that the conditions were good
3534604 party leader david ford claimed today that the dup and sinn fein do not want the minister to be a member of the executive meaning he or she would have no role in wider issues like the budget
3534605 so called breakthrough over the department of justice amounts to very little
3534606 apparently all the dup and sinn fein have proposed is a minister who would not even be a member of the executive
3534607 how could anyone fulfil a role as important as justice minister in those circumstances

3534614 we hope this will attract even more tourists to bedford as now not only they can fly and jump in the same day but the view from the top of the tunnel is awesome
3534615 we have had a lot of interest from people who want a bit of a james bond experience themselves
3534616 now not only can they try flying in the wind tunnel just as daniel craig did but they can also jump off the top you cant do a combined experience like this anywhere else at the moment
3534617 this is a great opportunity for hosted buyers to attend two of the key annual industry events in one week

3534756 i think that it is important for me to hopefully at least be able to play in two games and hopefully get the majority of reps in one of those games or at least a good half of one of those games i feel like if i can do that i will have the necessary reps that i need to feel good about myself on top of that ill be able to get more reps in practice and start to take more control of that situation

3534760 we have to adapt to the environmental changes that have already taken place or that we can reasonably expect will occur because of climate change
3534761 the city was built with an assumption of an environmental baseline and climate change in many ways changes that baseline
3534762 some of these transformations can potentially be catastrophic as large storms others might be more subtle and difficult to discern over the short term

3534864 in matters of faith one has to stop reasoning one should belief in the doctrine only by ones heart and mind
3534865 what is this the foundation upon which is built the huge edifice of the christian faith is the basis of my own faith only a matter of a blind following of some dictated belief which can never stand reasoning or the independent scrutiny by the dispassionate and impartial arguments from the clean conscience
3534866 what do you think the college authorities which are staunch catholics will do with me if some one informs them that i discuss in my private room things opposed to the catholic or the christian faith in general will they keep me on the staff of the college any longer if you want to discuss anything here you may do so but mind you you must confine your discussion to the subject of your studies in the college otherwise you will be doing the worst harm to me for i will be thrown out of my job
3534867 i have asked them but they say it is a matter of belief or faith and it should not be subjected to any logic or philosophy this has upset me it has raised the question in me if what i believe in is unreasonable and illogical why should i subject myself to any blind following is god so unjust and cruel to expect man to believe in a doctrine about himself which no human brain can ever reasonably conceive i request you sir to some how give me some method of arguing out the possibility of such an existence as the doctrine of trinity wants us to believe in
3534868 my dear joseph suppose you want me to prove by some mathematical formula how water can remain water and at the same time be fire or how a stone can be a stone at the same time be water too how can i do it i do not think any sensible man on earth can ever conceive such a possibility how the ever living god who being the ever living life itself can also at the same time be a mortal i e be a man to suffer death at the hands of the other mortals and how the same mortal being at the same time could be the absolute immortal god it is a problem which our priests want us to believe and we have to merely believe in it and none has any choice of even questioning the practicability of this inconceivable dogma
3534869 then what about you sir dont you also believe in it
3534870 it is a matter of my own personal and individual choice and decision even if i or the world were to believe in such a doctrine the liability still remains for every believer to answer the question if he or she can prove the doctrine as a reasonable or practical phenomena
3534871 the fact is when god whom we believe as one is absolutely one being in his perfect unity it means that god is singularly one in natural essence of his existence free from any different or variant factors having anything to do with his pure or absolute unity to justify his being the absolute one owing an indivisible existence by himself division suggests that the one is not an absolute one but a compound of some variants and that which is a composed being can never be really one in the true meaning of oneness and certainly the one dependent in its existence upon its different components can never be independent in its action whereas god is the absolute one independently omnipotent in his will and his action
3534872 besides how can any three which are three separate beings with three variations justify their being three separate entities remain there separately as they are and at the same time by themselves lose their different individual native properties differentiating them from each other and become conceivably the absolute indivisible one without the least variation in the essential oneness
3534873 an absolute one must be totally independent in its existence mr joseph as it impossible to reason out the doctrine of the holy trinity the science of mathematics or any other science which any human genius can ever conceive until the end of time can never solve this inconceivable riddle
3534874 the only thing is that we christians are shut out of the vast sources of knowledge about the truth and of the higher factors in matters of religion which are available outside our own fold by damning every non christian as the devils work we christians mr joseph in our madness to swell up our ranks have played such a disgraceful role that a great head like sir dennison ross had to helplessly disclose the truth about this in his foreword to the translation of the quran by george sale
3534875 it is a question yet to be decided you do not worry yourself about my personal choice i for the time being want to be known as no other than a catholic christian i will tell you later
3534876 for many centuries the acquaintance which the majority of europeans possessed of muhammadanism was based almost entirely on distorted reports of fanatical christians which led to the discrimination of a multitude of gross calumnies what was good in muhammadanism was entirely ignored and what was not good in the eyes of europe was exaggerated or misinterpreted
3534877 the unity of god and that the simplicity of his creed was probably a more potent factor in the spread of islam than the sword of the ghaziz
3534878 why criticize other people and their belief when the religion which i myself belong to has in it the sectarian segregation of the brahmin christian the naidu christian the chuckli christian and similar sectarian differences having full sway over the social order are not churches in christendom owned exclusively for the members of particular sects are there not churches belonging to a particular sect which cannot be used by the people of the other sect has not christianity failed to unite mankind into one human society did jesus preach all these differences and dissensions which we the christians have innovated is it not then that we are far away from the original objects of the mission of jesus christ
3534879 and as for ishmael i have heard thee behold i have blessed him and will make him fruitful and i will multiply him exceedingly twelve princes shall he beget and i will make him a great nation
3534880 what proofs have you besides the quran to establish that muhammad was truly a prophet of god
3534881 for moses truly said unto the fathers a prophet shall the lord your god raise unto you of your brethern like unto me him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you
3534882 and it shall come to pass that every soul which will not hear that prophet shall be destroyed from among the people
3534883 yea and all the prophets from samuel and those that follow after as many as have spoken have likewise foretold of these days
3534884 i will pray the father and he shall give another comforter that he may abide with you forever
3534885 i have yet many things to say unto you but ye can not bear them now
3534886 howbeit when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you unto all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak he will show you things to come
3534887 you read the verse again does not the verse say that god will raise a prophet like unto moses
3534888 do you not believe in jesus as the son of god cannot jesus be god himself in the form of a man
3534889 can there be a son to any one without a wife my friend
3534890 jesus addressed god as his father and also as our father which means that god is taken as the father of jesus as much as he is the father or the creator of any one of us and hence jesus sonship can mean in the sense of a creature of god the term son of god used by jesus can be used only in sense of a servant of god as jesus himself refers to himself as gods servant this fact is testified by the verses by which every prophet of god until adam has been termed as the son of god in luke 3rd chapter in verses from to 30 jesus is called as the son of joseph and the genealogy of joseph is traced to adam and adam is called the son of god read the 30th verse of the same chapter
3534891 which was the son of enos which was the son of seth which was the son of adam which was the son of god
3534892 do you believe in the holy bible as a heavenly book or not
3534893 please read page 17 in the founder of christianity and his religion published by the christian literature society madras it is said in the book
3534894 mr joseph if the bible is the book of the disciples and of jesus how would you account for the differences in the book if it is an inspired word of god does not the catholic bible duay contain some books which the protestant version does not own have you read what mr wilson says about the bible in his introduction to the diaglot published by the watch tower society
3534895 if it had not been published by kingly authority it would not now be venerated by english and american protestants as thought it had come direct from cod it has been convicted of containing over 20 000 errors nearly 700 creeks mss are now known and some of them very ancient whereas the translator of the common version had only the advantage of some 8 mss none of which was earlier then the tenth century
3534896 and noah began to be a husbandman and he planted a vineyard and he drank of the vine and was drunken and he was uncovered within his tent and ham the father of canaan saw the nakedness of his father and told his two breathren without and shem and japheth took a garment and laid it upon their father and their faces were backward and they saw not their fathers nakedness
3534897 what do you muslims believe in the prophets of god other than muhammad to be totally sinless and holy
3534898 say o muslims we believe in allah and that which is revealed unto us and that which was revealed unto abraham and ishmael and isaac and jacob and the tribes and that which moses and jesus received and that which the prophets received from their lord we make no distinction between any of them and unto him we have surrendered
3534899 the apostle muhammad believes in what has been revealed to him from his lord and so do the believers i e muslims they all believe in allah god and his angels his book the different holy scriptures and his apostles we make no difference between any of his apostles
3534900 there is not a nation but a warner has gone among them
3534901 do you think jesus to be a son of god or god himself
3534902 jesus according to the christian belief is god himself in the form of his son
3534903 do you ever consider that there is one other question confronting the doctrine of the trinity which needs to be answered by every trinitarian that if any three different beings which are three different entities are also at the same time one with absolute unity in all the perfect sense or meaning of oneness what is the common control which makes them remain three and also be one at one and the same time if there be any factor of such a wonderful and inconceivable phenomena causing this amazing effect then that supreme causative power which controls the number and the unity will alone be the omnipotent god and not any one of the three which are only the controlled components
3534904 besides there arises another problematic question which a believer in the trinity will have to answer i e as to whom is that controls or determines the splitting of one into only three different others to be neither more nor less in number there must be some cause for this controlled effect and that the causative factor acting supreme over three will be the omnipotent god and not any one of the three which will only be the effect of the supreme controlling cause
3534905 similarly will arise the question what is the causative power which affects the three to be only one when joining together and not divided into many groups of beings and if there be any such cause that supreme controlling cause will be the omnipotent god and not anyone of the three which will only be the subservient one
3534906 under any circumstances no sensible man can ever reasonably believe in any effect whatsoever without some causative factor effecting it
3534907 however the holy trinity is only a problematic doctrine created by the christian church which no logical reasoning can ever prove true
3534908 to ponder a little over the belief that jesus being god himself or the son of god was so terrified at the impending crucifixion that he shouted
3534909 what philosophy is that if jesus was god himself does it mean that god was forsaken by god himself and can that be god who felt hopeless and shouted to be rescued
3534910 your bible itself mr joseph reports that the son of god was forsaken by his father god in which case the forsaken son automatically and quite naturally forfeits his personal merits as a son and his relationship of being a son to his father what do you say of what profitable use can the attachment to a forsaken son be mr joseph please tell me
3534911 do you think jesus to be god himself when he falls down crying praying to someone else to remove the cup of death by crucifixion
3534912 alright sir how do you reconcile the violence used by the prophet of islam to his being an apostle of god
3534913 please mr joseph quote a single instance from the whole life history of the holy prophet muhammad to show that he has ever committed any unprovoked aggression or any single instance of his taking the least initiative in attacking any single soul each expedition of a battle he led or he allowed was only in self defense had he not defended as he did today his advent in this world and his teachings about the truth about god which the world has learnt only through his holy mission would have become legends of ancient times full of blasphemies for you and for me only to be read in story books and thus be deluded by falsehood for all times the bible does not preach self defense the bible only preaches self surrender to the extent of handing over everything of ones possession when anything which was in ones hand has been taken away by any aggressor does any christian power follow this
3534914 apart from the political history of the christian nations of europe do you not remember the inhuman methods employed by christendom to spread its faith
3534915 there is the doctrine of atonement or expiation of sins of men through the blood of jesus jesus having paid the price of the sins of man i e he who believes in jesus is cleansed and saved have you any such accommodation in islam
3534916 my friend the greatest of gods gifts to man is common sense if man forfeits it of his own accord then none can help him
3534917 first let me know if this doctrine appeals to reason and common sense a for example a christian by faith i e a believer in jesus christ as his savior plunders the house of b and the members of bs family does sense or logic agree to a being let off unpunished by any law particularly the law of the all just lord of the universe simply because a accepts jesus as his savior
3534918 if the sins of man have been paid for god has no right to punish any sinner every sinner who merely believes in jesus would be free to do anything in the world which his brutal passion dictates him to do for god his lord has no right whatsoever even to question any sinner for jesus has met the cost of all his sins can this ever be sensible logic or common sense can this doctrine help life on earth to continue for one moment in peace and security
3534919 please remember islam wants every individual to be kept bound by his being answerable with his individual responsibility to virtue against vice in the interest of his own individual life as well as the interest of the collective life in this world himself as a member of not only the human race but also of the creation of the lord as a whole
3534920 and be on your guard against a day when one soul shall not avail another in the least neither shall intercession on its behalf be accepted nor shall they be helped
3534921 whoever goes aright for his own soul does he go aright and whoever goes astray to its detriment only does he goes astray nor can the bearer of a burden bear the burden of another nor do we chastise until we raise an apostle
3534922 o ye men surely we have created you of a male and female and made you tribes and families that you may know each other surely the most honorable of you with allah is the one among you most careful of his duty surely allah is knowing aware
3534923 while threatening man with grievous punishment in recompense for his evils the holy quran discloses also the infinite mercy of the all merciful lord who does not want man however much a sinner the individual be to be totally dejected or hopeless of the merciful pardon from him the only condition for the pardon he needs being the sinners repentance against his vices with his intention of amending his conduct in the future and turning whole heartedly to obedience and gratitude to the all merciful lord for his infinite grace
3534924 for goodness sake tell me mr joseph which do you think is reasonable and sensible either making man intoxicated and careless against sinning i e making him unreasonably confident of the price of his sins as having already been paid by someone or alerting with his commitment to virtue against vice i e keeping him warned of the natural consequence of getting punishment by the all just lord against any misconduct or disobedience
3534925 mr joseph you must thank god for blessing you with the fulfillment of his merciful promise to every sincere seeker of truth
3534926 and as for ishmael i have heard thee behold i have blessed him and will make him fruitful and i will multiply him exceedingly twelve princes shall he beget and i will make him a great nation
3534927 for this is the day of the lord god of hosts a day of vengeance that he may avenge him of his adversaries and the sword shall devour and it shall be satiated and made drunk with their blood for lord god of hosts hath a sacrifice in the north country by the river euphrates
3534928 you will be glad to know my dear son that today i got 109 souls into our fold at the baptism of such a big number in one day the rev father the chief of our mission praised my services very much and has increased my salary as well my traveling allowance and has awarded me with a token reward of rs 109 corresponding to the number baptized through my efforts
3534929 no they are the poor people of the cherries slums they are only laborers in the paddy fields of their villages
3534930 what do you mean i told you they are all uneducated poor illiterates laborers from the slums the group consists of men women and children now i will have to go there every day and coach them up in the doctrine of our faith
3534931 nothing father i do not see in this mass conversion any matter of pride or pleasure which any true religion or any genuine or reasonable faith can claim for itself for it is nothing but exploiting the illiteracy and ignorance of the poor laborers it is leading the mentally blind ones into something which they neither know nor recognize do you think father that any sensible man can reasonably be proud over his getting some illiterate men women and children to accept his own ideals and justifiably claim the least merit or value to his thoughts
3534932 while the entry into a faith like islam is effected only after a detailed study and enquiry by the learned ones with perfect conviction we christians pride over our success in swelling up our ranks by mass conversions of illiterate laborers who by circumstances are forced to accept the christian doctrines without knowing what they do is right or wrong an ignorant mind is like a blank sheet one can draw upon it whatever ones fancy chooses and once the inscription is made to be settled upon such raw material any artist can pride over the plate having any particular design of his own if today to win the sympathy of the ignorant masses we boast before our illiterate converts of our humanity and self sacrifices in the cause of the spread of our faith will the outer world also forget the edict of milan father and will all the records of the history of the brutal outrages that christendom committed against the poor helpless jews in its own passionate eagerness and anxiety to swell its ranks all together totally vanish
3534933 if you kindly permit me father i would like to know from you if this bible in your hands is to be merely read memorized and preached to the others or is it to be acted upon in our daily life if it is to be acted upon will you kindly show me father if the christian world could ever practice the principle of turning the other cheek also if one is already smitten could any sincere christian till now give away his shirt when his coat was taken away will you father surrender our whole house if any body invades our residence and takes possession of any of the rooms in these premises if the christian powers of the world really believe in this doctrine of self surrender why do they maintain their military and the police forces kindly tell me father if there is any earthly use of merely believing in any golden ideals which can only adorn the pages of some books and which can only be preached but never practiced why should we not reasonably accept the doctrine of self defense taught by islam and the principle of pardoning our offenders if they are repentant for goodness sake let me know father how can three different ones at the same time be an absolute one both numerically and also in the essential nature of perfect unity on what reasonable grounds can the one who is forsaken by god be god himself and if jesus is to be believed as the son of god what claim to the relationship with his father can a forsaken son have
3534934 what right has christendom to claim any truth in it when its spread was caused by the inhuman atrocities committed by the christian forces against the poor helpless jews the conduct of the brutal outrages committed in the holy name of christ has been fully reported even by the christian authorities on edict of milan and by the world renowned christian scholar gibbon in his famous work the decline and the fall of the roman empire
3534935 the doctrine of atonement through the blood of christ will naturally attract those sinner who have sinned and who do not want to give up sinning under the protection of the doctrine that the price of their sins has already been paid away and however much worst sinners they themselves choose to be they will not in the least be chastised for their heinous crimes for after jesus having paid away for the sins of man god must have forfeited his claim to punish the sinners thereafter
3534936 i tell you father that whatever be the consequences and whatever misfortune may afflict me i as one have decided not to sell away or forfeit my conscience and common sense to the belief in such unreasonable dogmatic doctrines i have embraced islam and if you do not get angry with me and kindly allow me to explain to you the details of my enquiries i will do it whenever i am wanted to do so i do not like any thought or belief of mine to be swallowed by anyone by force for the religion islam which i now openly declare to have embraced enjoins that there shall not be any compulsion in the matter of faith as the truth has been revealed against falsehood
3534937 son do not think that your father is a fool i have been occasionally confronted with such ideas during my life whenever i had the occasion of discussing religion with my muslim friends but today the sincerity and the boldness with which you expose your own convictions make me bold to decide about the matter i shall tell you later but for gods sake keep this matter strictly confined to you otherwise be sure we will be thrown out into the street as destitute
3534938 blessed be the lord who has not given us as prey to their teeth we are like a bird escaped from the snare of the fowlers the snare is broken and we have escaped our help is in the name of the lord who made heaven and earth
3534939 just because you have no friends and i stoped someone els from being your friends ha ha

3534949 my objective behind the vampiress was to give the viewing audience a taste of romance and hardcore action to exploit the vampire fetish to its fullest without overkill on the blood and gore to show a bit of the past and a bit of the present eras
3534950 i had so much fun working with raveness amber ava and especially joe i hope my fans enjoy watching the movie as much as i did being in it

3534993 improving the safety and quality of care and arming consumers with the information they need to make smarter choices is a key component of health care reform
3534994 these bills will help set the stage for comprehensive reform by creating incentives for health care providers to improve patient care and by giving californians the information they need to find the best health insurance value
3534995 it is no wonder that infections spread from patient to patient when trained medical professionals ignore basic infection control practices
3534996 we need public disclosure of infection rates because californians deserve to know which hospitals are doing a good job protecting patients
3534997 shining the spotlight on health care quality including breakouts by race and ethnicity will help consumers make more informed choices and spur hospitals and other health care providers to improve patient care and reduce disparities
3534998 ultimately that will help improve patient outcomes and save billions of health care dollars
3534999 californians who buy individual health coverage are at the mercy of big insurance companies because they dont have market power or the information they need to evaluate different plans
3535000 consumers find it hard to compare products and to know which products provide value and security californians need an insurance marketplace that so they know the value of what they are getting and that what they are getting has value if insurance doesnt protect you from major medical bills when you are sick it is no longer insurance

3535012 so my pal quit blogging not because she was intimidated by the threats this is one tough lady but because life was too short and she didnt need to blog it had just been her way of giving back to the writing community of course after that some people said she was wimpy for not staying around so they could kick her again evidently missing the point that sticking around to get insulted by a bunch of people with no sense of humor had no upside for her
3535013 i think most people just file the disappointment away under things i know about that author without going after her as someone unclean who must be eradicated from publishing blogs or books
3535014 the us dollar offers negative interest rates when adjusted by inflation and the federal reserve could be pressured to increase rates faster than traders had expected
3535015 this week the release of inflation figures for several countries is likely to catch the attention of many traders indeed we expect consumer prices to increase to record levels but also to be close to peaking since energy prices are significantly lower than they were in the previous month

3535054 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3535055 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3535056 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3535057 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3535058 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3535059 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3535060 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3535080 about all we can say right now is that the boeing tanker team met with dod officials to discuss our comments on the draft rfp and gain further clarity in how the requirements and evaluation criteria have changed since the initial competition
3535081 any decision on boeings path forward would be premature and further speculation would be counter productive
3535082 boeing remains committed to providing the air force with a next generation tanker that meets real world mission requirements and that is selected through a fair open and unbiased competition that follows a realistic timetable
3535083 it is clear that the defense department met the concerns raised by the government accountability office and the draft amendment to the kc x tanker request for proposals addresses those concerns by clarifying but not altering the tanker requirements and specifications
3535084 it is also clear that the department recognizes the need to begin production on the next generation of aerial refueling tankers as quickly as possible we look forward to submitting our proposal

3535091 we all possess some intuitive sense we know our convictions from our mere hunches
3535092 this sense of confidence or lack thereof is critical to our success but how it arises in the brain has long been a mystery
3535093 these neurons seem to have been registering after the rat made its decision how uncertain the animal was that it was about to receive its desired reward
3535094 we tested several alternative explanations but the best explanation for the neural activity we observed was that these neurons were signaling the confidence of the animal about its decisions
3535095 although previous work had suggested that confidence estimates might be a complex process restricted to humans and perhaps other primates
3535096 our results to the contrary show that for the brain to estimate confidence in a choice is no more complex than calculating the choice itself
3535097 this new option to abort and restart constitutes a decision that should be made based on the level of confidence about getting a reward
3535098 ultimately confidence about getting a reward is a direct function of the animals confidence about the decision they have just made in this way we sought to measure a variable internal to the animals how confident they were about whether they made the right choice or not by observing how it influenced their behavior
3535099 that confidence estimation is not a complex function specific to humans but a core component of the process of decision making probably found throughout the animal kingdom
3535100 future studies of this kind may illuminate the question of how we form an intuitive sense of the solidity of a belief how we distinguish fact from fiction itself

3535146 if only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them but the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being and who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart
3535147 there is a principle which is a bar against all information which is proof against all arguments and which cannot fail to keep a man in everlasting ignorance that principle is contempt prior to investigation

3535151 the survey shows auckland still has an undisputed lead over other oecd cities when it comes to entrepreneurship
3535152 auckland has an extraordinary number of entrepreneurs but many of them are lifestylers not involved in high aspiration ventures as in other cities this means they are more likely to start up a business from a product or service already in the market rather than come up with something new
3535153 our entrepreneurs as prevalent as they may be do not contribute much to our wealth high aspiration entrepreneurship is associated with entrepreneurship education and there simply is not enough of that in new zealand

3535164 the point at which we are now is that we have dealt with all the critical elements on which president mugabe and mutambara agree but theres disagreement with one element over which morgan tsvangirai has asked for more time to reflect
3535165 we and the mdc headed by mutambara have signed the agreement tsvangirai did not sign the agreement because he is basically trying to take us back to renegotiate issues that we had already agreed on we are proceeding and the president is going to form a government of national unity including members of the opposition

3535170 they were saying that no ones rights had been affected

3535175 oclc management will do what it takes to support the transition to the new governance model
3535176 we want and need to hear from the various regions of the oclc co operative we want to improve the conversation at all levels throughout the co operative
3535177 i believe this is the next step to make the oclc a true global co operative with local connections and local touch through regional councils
3535178 the board remains deeply committed to libraries and other cultural heritage organisations as we continue to work cooperatively for the benefit of our users worldwide
3535179 should be set up based on agreed upon principles and that they are funded properly
3535180 methodology that should be designed for broad representation of all types and sizes of institutions represented on regional councils
3535181 many people with a deep commitment to libraries and to the oclc cooperative worked very hard over many months to develop these governance recommendations i am very grateful for their time and effort
3535182 some t cell receptors are adept at promoting autoimmunity some are poor and some are protective it is not clear why one t cell receptor can promote autoimmunity whereas another t cell receptor on a similar kind of t cell either doesnt do anything or even protects against autoimmune reaction
3535183 this finding of an association between t cell engraftment and spontaneous disease suggested to us that there is some barrier to the development of disease
3535184 why are cells that engraft better more likely to cause disease we really dont know the answer once the mice start to get disease they get very sick but there is sort of a triggering point our findings may suggest that disease triggering in these models involves a mass effect that requires some quantity of specific t cells to ignite disease but we really want to find out whether it is the cell number itself or whether receptor recognition properties that lead to increased engraftment also lead to increased susceptibility to disease these are things we can test
3535185 these findings dont have a direct clinical implication right now but if we understand which t cells induce pathology and why and which cells are protective or passive we will gain a better sense of where to target what are called antigen specific therapies
3535186 those therapies try to selectively target the t cells that cause disease sparing the rest of the immune system

3535201 my use of journals is almost entirely online now the ability to obtain articles online has made my work much more efficient and more thorough
3535202 finding articles online is so much easier and faster than finding articles in dusty journals in musty corners of the library
3535203 i rarely visit the library in person anymore which compared with the ease and convenience of doing literature searches downloading and printing from my office computer takes too long
3535204 i have stopped getting personal subscriptions and rely on the electronic journals supplied by the library
3535205 i have dropped personal subscriptions as they have become available online even the society subscriptions that i maintain are usually accessed through the university e journals subscriptions
3535206 the premeditated slaying of john lennon with an essentially clear mind
3535207 your conduct thus precipitated a horrendously tragic event which has impacted many individuals

3535215 i grew up playing in what was a field right here but its not the same its very different and it happened so fast that the people in the rest of virginia are kind of shell shocked
3535216 ill vote for anybody who can get more than half the vote
3535217 its upsetting to me that the country is 50 50 im sick of it and i think a lot of people that lean more conservative feel the same way
3535218 i was going to do it simply as a spoiler with no idea in the world of voting for him later on
3535219 he said were not red states or blue states we are the united states and i thought finally somebody said it it literally made me cry then again im menopausal
3535220 the tv was turned this way i wasnt watching it i was just listening all of a sudden i just got chills all over me and i started laughing because it was so unexpected i dont even remember what it was he said
3535221 dyed in the wool republicans are saying obama is not that awfully bad
3535222 he appeals to me at some level that even though i cant account for it in terms of issues im going to listen to my gut and support a candidate that is just appealing to me for whatever reason whether thats shallow or because hes marketed well im not sure
3535223 if mccain had stood up and given the best speech of his life and had people electrified to vote for him then id vote for him
3535224 but it just so happens that it was obama he has touched something in me and in a whole lot of friends of mine that have never voted for a democrat and in a lot of people who honestly would never consider voting for a black man we all feel that something has to change and now for the first time theres the possibility that something can be different
3535225 in presidential elections you have between 4 and 11 percent of each party regularly defecting to the other side think of it the other way that means 90 percent or more of partisans vote for the candidate of their party

3535232 she told the indian students to stand up and said she wanted to test how we would react to the word keling pariah

3535234 the original intent was that anything beyond a production costs would go toward the peace plan ross said

3535236 i dont think anybody thought going in that this was going to be a fundraiser said barbaro who as of now hasnt received any tickets for local democratic activists
3535237 it seems that this will skew the audience to a more well heeled republican element
3535238 especially young democrats who had been online trying to get in and now will have absolutely no chance to see this by virtue of the expense

3535257 it didnt matter whether he had to take on his own government or whoever if he believed in a cause for his constituents that was his first loyalty
3535258 mick was a tenacious mp and a loyal servant of his community and the labor party
3535259 a lot of the bans last week were around the hours that people worked and the sort of systems and processes that they were operating cutting back largely on the goodwill that the public sector has been delivered
3535260 this is now going to be blow to revenue raising we want the government to hear loud and clear that public sector workers believe that pay parity should be delivered and should be delivered now and they will take action in pursuit of that
3535261 one of the things that public sector workers do right across the board is raise money for the government by collecting tax income from the public or from billing private companies or collecting money from the commonwealth government
3535262 weve targetted a number of areas where that occurs to cut of the supply of income
3535263 i can understand that the public sector would want to increase their levels of remuneration but once again having had this increase over the last nine years thats putting real pressure on the government to curb those increases
3535264 its not reflecting reality and it should include the casuals so that we get the true picture
3535265 what we have got is a doubling in the wage and salary bills to the tasmanian tax payer over a period of about nine years what we may well have is something quite dramatically more than that
3535266 people have already left the region the economic and social ramifications are considerable
3535267 theres no doubt that the government needs to act with a greater degree of urgency
3535268 we will welcome if appropriate an injection of financial assistance thats actually going to deliver some positive outcomes but were already very concerned that damage has been done in the six weeks that this government has been sitting back idly
3535269 im really excited to be running for the nas ten miles is a long way to run but i know from personal experience that living with autism is a lot more challenging this is my way of helping to raise awareness of and funds for autism which is a serious lifelong and disabling condition i urge anyone whos thinking about running the bupa great south run to go for it and do something really worthwhile by joining the nas team
3535270 its fantastic that chris has chosen to support the nas and the branch in this way were a fairly new branch and im sure there are some people on the island who still dont know about us chriss efforts will not only raise much needed funds but also help raise awareness the more people who know about us the better
3535271 the island is fortunate it has two strong organisations now working together in clear concert to promote the island as a first class year round destination
3535272 the agreement allows us as a local authority to concentrate on what it does best marketing and promoting the island as a fantastic place to work and to invest as well as to visit and the chamber to represent the interests of its members and the wider industry through tactical promotion of tourism
3535273 with the current uncertain economic climate is it vital we work in partnership to ensure the islands crucial visitor economy remains buoyant the council is with partners currently orchestrating three major strategic campaigns and i can assure the industry we will continue to meet our obligations to market and promote this wonderful destination
3535274 this is good news for the future of tourism on the isle of wight we are very excited about our new initiatives to promote the island in partnership with the isle of wight council

3535293 in this article i examine a normative idea of territoriality which i call ethical territoriality by ethical territoriality i mean the conviction that rights and recognition should extend to all persons who are territorially present within the geographical space of a national state simply by virtue of that presence i start by briefly reprising a claim i have developed elsewhere that territorialism is preferable on liberal democratic grounds to status based approaches to immigrants rights here though i set out to interrogate the logic of ethical territoriality itself i ask why the mere fact of a persons territorial presence should serve as the basis for rights and recognition further even conceding that it should i ask how this commitment is to be operationalized what is the scope of the territory in which presence figures so significantly in normative terms and who precisely gets access to presence in that territory my purpose in this article is to get beyond the status vs territorial presence as basis for membership dispute in the immigration debates and to begin a self critical discussion of the ethical territorial commitment itself

3535298 well we can do that we can have a vote on that but it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public and not just a hoax on them
3535299 two things struck me right away the first was that outward
3535300 the second was the thought wow it was even worse than id imagined the anger and toxic obsessions overwhelmed even the most reserved beltway wise men surprisingly clinton herself when pressed was her own shrewdest strategist a role that had never been her strong suit in the white house but her advisers couldnt execute strategy they routinely attacked and undermined each other and clinton never forced a resolution major decisions would be put off for weeks until suddenly she would erupt driving her staff to panic and misfire
3535301 above all this irony emerges clinton ran on the basis of managerial competence on her capacity as she liked to put it to
3535302 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3535303 clinton did not take penns advice revealed by a report in the september issue of the atlantic magazine
3535304 so here i am waiting in breathless anticipation of the 200 emails from clintons campaign leaked by some well meaning campaign staffer who loves her country and only wants what is best for it ie a man who spent less time in the senate than most kindergartners spend in their first year of school before he decided he was ready to be president

3535310 the wall street journal recently did an article on failing etfs which hinted my view about them which is
3535311 no a trader is someone who makes a living trading ie needs to make money everyday and hence makes many trades daily
3535312 i guess im nosy do you care to share one such portfolio
3535313 i was not sure i wanted to order it unless it covered the tax aspects although am still mulling it over
3535314 etfs avoid irksome capital gain distributions through the clever use of exchanges in kind trades of mutual fund shares for securities in the fund with arbitrageurs because these trades are not taxable events etfs are typically able to rebalance their portfolios without realizing capital gains in effect etf shareholders are taxed as if the etf is just another security they pay taxes on dividends distributed by the fund but they are only hit with capital gain taxes when they sell their etf shares
3535315 the big advantage of etfs is that the sale of securities inside the fund does not typically generate taxable capital gains for etf shareholders investors in traditional open end funds must pay taxes each year on any net capital gains generated by trades inside the fund

3535522 we see russias decision to stop military operations in georgia as a positive development i hope we see a ceasefire confirmed by the two sides as soon as possible implementation of this decision is very important
3535523 turkey will continue its efforts for the reinstitution of peace and stability in the region we attach importance to georgias territorial integrity and sovereignty
3535524 likewise we continue doing this with our neighbor iraq under these circumstances we have to be very meticulous and thoroughly consider every statement that we make all statements on the issue have to be very diplomatically worded
3535525 a caucasian stability pact is important in the medium term we have made similar efforts in the middle east too
3535526 of course i do not want to think the way you suggested i do not want to but we can get involved in an effort such as a caucasian alliance or caucasus alliance similar to what we have in the balkans as turkey we may take a role here in order to create this with related countries and to develop this idea first of all with the un today i will call un secretary general ban ki moon to discuss this matter if we take a step toward a caucasus alliance together with the united states and the european union member nations i believe that we can create the grounds for peace in the caucasus
3535527 the russian federation should certainly participate in a caucasus alliance
3535528 the civilian death toll has reached 3 000 our teams that made it to tbilisi report that people were fleeing to the forests out of fear leaving children and the elderly in the cities

3535533 stop the operation to force the georgian authorities to peace
3535534 the aggressor has been punished and sustained very serious losses
3535535 thats the signal people were waiting for things have fallen so low that we are about 50 percent cheaper than brazilian equity
3535536 they can no longer remain they brought shame upon themselves as peacekeepers they committed crimes
3535537 there were isolated skirmishes along the front line but no major offensives by either side overnight
3535538 saakashvili said moscow should know georgia will not quit georgia will never surrender
3535539 we are leaving the cis for good and propose that other countries leave this body run by russia
3535540 our goal is to free the kodori gorge of georgian troops
3535541 today the assault begins it is a high mountain operation
3535542 we are entering a new stage with about 3 000 troops with artillery aviation and infantry reinforcements
3535543 convert m4a aac to mp3 ac3 amr m4a ogg and wav
3535544 i think the fear is that somehow large corporations will censor their content their points of view right
3535545 i think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy which by the way would have a big first amendment problem
3535546 then whoever is in charge of government is going to determine what is fair under a so called fairness doctrine which wont be called that itll be called something else
3535547 so will web sites will bloggers have to give equal time or equal space on their web site to opposing views rather than letting the marketplace of ideas determine that

3535552 i condemn this terrorist attack that targeted us and this is not the first attempt
3535553 we consider it our duty to contribute to the preservation of endangered species we are looking forward to working closely with the rspb and birdlife international and hope that with our commitment it will soon be possible to downlist the sociable lapwing from its critically endangered status our products such as binoculars and telescopes are used for the most part in nature and are held in particularly high regard by birdwatchers
3535554 our research so far has told us an enormous amount about the bird and uncovered populations we had no idea existed
3535555 the birds problems seem to be linked more to its migration and wintering grounds than its breeding sites and this new funding means we can step up our monitoring work to find out more about where these birds go and the problems they face on their migration routes
3535556 this agreement is a huge boost for the project we are confident more international businesses and conservation organisations will follow the lead of swarovski and the rspb and provide the vital funding needed to save other species on the brink of extinction
3535557 im going to take the rest of the evening to decide
3535558 tomorrow morning ill send a press release out i am very much edging toward doing so i just need a couple more hours to decide
3535559 if do it i have to hit the ground running
3535560 we dont have any choice i dont have staffers im not set up for a campaign
3535561 theres no question the selection of tom ridge as john mccains running mate would make our job harder here
3535562 the most important step against global warming is forestation upon the orders of our prime minister we have begun a national forestation campaign the biggest there has ever been we have made it a goal to reforest at least 2 300 000 hectares of land by the year 2012 this is an area nearly the size of belgium
3535563 the water drying up has turned into a real nightmare for the villages they are now trying to create their own means to water their lands and gardens
3535564 we have never encountered such a situation before i spend thousands of liras to be able to irrigate my crops i laid nearly 700 one meter pipes to be able carry the water to the fields but of course not everyone can afford this
3535565 however we have not achieved any results this pond is the only way for us to prevent drought

3535570 were hoping that people get real excited about using it
3535571 well be ready for the next generation of the internet
3535572 this is a common thing that many districts and businesses have so were really excited to be able to offer that
3535573 this has been something we needed for a long time
3535574 its been good for the community because they will be able to see multiple things on the new marquee the marquee will beautify the area not just the 900 block but surrounding areas
3535575 we have 6 000 square feet now so were nearly doubling in size
3535576 whenever you do computer chips you need ultra pure water to rinse it they measure contaminants in parts per trillion
3535577 we ship to hemlock and businesses all over the country

3535589 mr maddy what do have to say to your students and their parents anything to say mr maddy
3535590 he was a nice teacher he was nice when we had him at class and stuff and it was just weird
3535591 theyre still working on it and theyll continue to work on it to make sure that everything goes the way they want it to no rock will go unturned

3535595 my son liked what he was doing he was making a career out of the army
3535596 saying we honor them and having someone actually do it means the ultimate for us
3535597 it just seems like everybody forgets but these people have made it a point not to forget the fallen

3535599 no cumple algunos de los principios que gu an las pol ticas cambiarias

3535602 generate less than 1 percent of the transportation departments annual energy use
3535603 would generate 10 6 megawatts of power enough to increase the states current solar output by a factor of 10 and provide electricity for 1 450 households
3535604 the premeditated slaying of john lennon with an essentially clear mind
3535605 your conduct thus precipitated a horrendously tragic event which has impacted many individuals
3535606 your discretionary release at this time would thus not be compatible with the welfare of society at large and would tend to deprecate the seriousness of the instant offence and undermine respect for the law
3535607 geopolitical concerns always provide good support to oil prices and this news should offer some relief to investors worried about exports of azeri crude from ports in georgia
3535608 the strong recovery in the dollar adds more pressure to the sector which is already suffering from fears over slowing global growth
3535609 while not ready to call an end to this years bull market especially considering the murky outlook for chinese energy demand and continuing weather and geopolitical risks the agencys assessment of increased supply and inventories from june to july provides some fundamental justification for the sharp fall in benchmark crude prices in july

3535612 we and the mdc headed by mutambara have signed the agreement mr tsvangirai did not sign the agreement because he is basically trying to take us back to renegotiate issues that we had already agreed on
3535613 we are proceeding and the president is going to form a government of national unity including members of the opposition
3535614 the talks have not collapsed its just a time out break
3535615 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
3535616 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
3535617 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
3535618 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
3535619 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
3535620 no one in the democratic party would want to be publicly associated with him
3535621 he was raised as one of us the son of a mill worker he always said
3535622 fighting poverty and providing health care for everybody i hope those are still always his beliefs
3535623 had that not happened i think he would have made an absolutely incredible secretary of labor
3535624 we would have loved to see him play a prominent role in government
3535625 he was the first person since lyndon johnson to address it in a meaningful way
3535626 he was very sincere about wanting to cure the problems
3535627 hes going to have to rebuild his base from the bottom
3535628 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway i mean im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3535629 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
3535630 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
3535631 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
3535632 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
3535633 im thirsty can you point me to the soda pop aisle
3535634 people want choices people want the opportunity to make their own decisions
3535635 they come in and they look and they go were overwhelmed
3535636 since reagan the ideology in the united states has been that choice is good and more choice is better and to the extent that you can give people more choice in every area of life you are improving their well being
3535637 nobody has the time or the expertise to make informed choices about everything
3535638 when options are presented people have a tough time just ignoring them
3535639 its wonderful that we can sit down in our living room and order 20 000 things in a superficial way we are more informed than people used to be but its hard to get our attention and i dont see any way of turning that around
3535640 the era of choice the ability to choose and its transformation of contemporary life
3535641 follow me unless you have something more interesting going on
3535642 the only way were going to solve our problems in this country is if all of us come together
3535643 we are fellow americans and that shared distinction means more to me than any other association
3535644 theres no way were going back to the times of zachary taylor
3535645 with more choices out there if leaders want to bring issues to the attention of the public they have to bring it into our venues and speak it on our terms
3535646 institutions are breaking down and there are going to be new ways of doing things but the cream can still rise the signal can still make it through the noise in this new environment
3535647 you dont need 90 percent of the public informed on the issue and following it closely to get your policy passed
3535648 not everybody was running around yelling yeah yeah liberty death
3535649 this country is an experiment and for it to have endured for this long it requires the involvement of citizens citizens making choices
3535650 where are those conversations we had like patrick henry on the steps
3535651 i ever only had one car because the other was a government jag
3535652 kinnock said you cant be transport minister and drive a jag
3535653 when you get on an aeroplane do you go and see if the pilots smiling
3535654 hello this is john prescott please go out and vote
3535655 i said gordon brown is the right man for the job at the end of the day they believed in those times that that ship could never sink the captain still had a responsibility but the thing that actually sank it was the iceberg the challenge is how do you navigate around it
3535656 please help us shrink the supply of oil and block refinery and nuclear plant construction so that the price of gasoline and power will be so expensive well have to live like our great grandparents without cars modern electric powered appliances airplanes and without the things made in factories and raised on modern farms
3535657 im trying to save the planet im trying to save the planet
3535658 we have as a city worked very hard to make sure the water we provide meets the highest standards
3535659 and i think we do a great disservice to ourselves by not promoting the time and effort weve put into both our water and wastewater systems
3535660 those small incidences are whats forming the opinion of our customers of the overall system and we believe its the inaccurate leaning toward those issues that is clouding our ability to properly communicate what were doing
3535661 our paths have crossed over the years a number of times
3535662 she has done many projects kind of specialized in water and wastewater she has a good idea about the concerns what people talk about and how to reach them with a message
3535663 we can target our communications so much better when we know what your customers and your residents are thinking
3535664 from an uninformed standpoint theyre throwing accusations and making assumptions as to what is coming out of our treatment plant
3535665 we dont sit here and make these decisions just to raise rates its all based on in most cases state statutes and federal requirements
3535666 the things that were required to do to the water and the sewer are unfunded mandates
3535667 to share our success stories but at the same time address the concerns
3535668 we are proud that panasonic has been able to work closely with the cable industry in developing tru2way products ranging from advanced digital cable boxes incorporating digital video recorder capability which cable companies can provide to their subscribers to spectacular new tru2way enabled viera plasma hdtvs which will be available for consumer purchase at retail this fall
3535669 the 42 inch class tru2way enabled viera plasma hdtv integrates a tru2way cable receiver capability within the sets chassis thereby eliminating the need for an outboard cable set top box
3535670 they can buy a locomotive anyplace in the world they can buy it anyplace in the world but they buy it here because its the most fuel efficient and its the most environmentally sound and it requires the least maintenance
3535671 i want you and every american to tell the congress that when we start anew in january of 2009 lets sit down together republican and democrat libertarian vegetarian whoever it is lets sit down together and start working on these problems together and put our country first
3535672 now if youd just raise your hand we have some people with a microphone or if youd like to go back to work whichever
3535673 where did the internet come from besides al gore and by the way i have great respect for vice president gore
3535674 eighty four percent of the american people think that the countrys on the wrong track congress has a 9 percent approval rating now you get down to 9 percent youre down to paid staffers and blood relatives you cant get much lower than that
3535675 um call tom ridge to washington from whatever vacation he is taking and get him to work
3535676 who will be the next president of the united states
3535677 the most productive and most competitive worker in the world resides in the united states of america
3535678 drilling offshore isnt the answer either but its a bridge its an important bridge to exploit our own oil and natural gas reserves while were making this transition that we must make to energy independence
3535679 i liked what he had to say today i want to hear more of what hes going to do to solve our issues
3535680 its a very important thing to do in life vote for someone thats going to run your future
3535681 the black and white prints we made had a very even tonal range and deep shadows especially on watercolor and fiber gloss papers
3535682 the player offers solid file support wrapped in a good looking package
3535683 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
3535684 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
3535685 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
3535686 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
3535687 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
3535688 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
3535689 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
3535690 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
3535691 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
3535692 my experience as a missionary teacher in africa opened my eyes to this simple fact without access to energy life is brutal and short
3535693 a great slideshows is determined by the type of interaction a presenter has with their slides
3535694 if the presenter is addicted to reading bullet points then everyone in the room suffers
3535695 we can keep blaming software for the putrid output but in reality we need to take responsibility
3535696 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure

3535699 erw hnenswert ist in diesem zusammenhang noch dass der werner haverbeck an der fh bielefeld ungeachtet seiner nazi karriere und neofaschistischen aktivit ten ungest rt seinen ideologischen und politischen gesch ften nachgehen und seine verdorbenen fr chte als professor f r sozialwissenschaft unter die studierenden bringen konnte ohne je daf r an der fh in die kritik zu geraten und ohne dass das rektorat der fh es je f r n tig gehalten h tte sich von seinem tun oder seinen schriften zu distanzieren dass aber dasselbe rektorat nicht in persona und dessen personalabteilungsleiter es f r dringlich h lt sich von dem herausgeber dieser seite und der internetzeitschrift f r kritische theorie der gesellschaft das kritiknetz ausdr cklich zu distanzieren
3535700 we thought our climb was over but couldnt go down our ascent route
3535701 alpinism is not just death tragedy survival and heroism we hope our climb will serve as a reminder that mountaineers like us and many others climb mountains to live to enjoy to grow and to accept the verdicts of life and sometimes also of fate without arguing or lacking respect toward those who share the same value the value of life
3535702 this year a passing will be impossible for a small boat as you can see on the ice situation map end of july 2008
3535703 arctic ice has diminished but theres more ice in antarctica now truth is about 2 3rd of total north pole ice always melts by the end of the northern summer this summer it got down to about 1 4 of the winter amount it is much less alarming if you consider that the total between the 2 poles only represents about a 5 reduction from normal
3535704 this was such a road these were such gold splashed peaks
3535705 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
3535706 permanent destruction of hundreds of thousands of acres of pristine public lands designated for multi purpose use that belong to the people
3535707 wilderness killing unacceptable groundwater depletion and the erosion of hard fought protections of public lands and private rights
3535708 our take has been from day one here we go again
3535709 here is where we can do everything out in the desert that we dont want to do in our own backyards in the city
3535710 the idea that were going to sacrifice critical pieces of our environment to protect other pieces of our environment seems a little ironic
3535711 thats an irony i cannot accept we have to find a way to do both
3535712 its not just businesses that have slowed things down its not just republicans that have slowed things down its also democrats and also environmental activists sometimes that slow things down
3535713 they say that we want renewable energy but we dont want you to put it anywhere we dont want you to use it
3535714 i dont know whether this is ironic or absurd but i mean if we cannot put solar power plants in the mojave desert i dont know where the hell we can put it
3535715 before there was the internet and at the time i was at the justice department leading the prosecutions we could say with a fair amount of certainty that the number of people involved in child pornography in america was small and getting smaller
3535716 they then begin to trade child pornography with traders on the internet people who have collections however someone who has an extensive collection is not willing to give you that collection unless you can provide original material to that person
3535717 how do you get original material you begin to molest your neighbors kids maybe your own kids and your relatives
3535718 believed to keep sinking all the way down to the bottom cutting deep crevasses and vertical tunnels that scientists call moulins
3535719 when the water reaches the bottom of the ice it lubricates the surface of the bedrock and destabilizes the ice mass
3535720 large pieces of ice to slide quickly into the ocean
3535721 could lead to a far more rapid disintegration of the ice sheets than predicted by any current models
3535722 present ice velocity measurements from the major ablation area along the western margin of the ice sheet
3535723 ice velocity reacts to increased meltwater production and increases by a factor of 4
3535724 over a longer period of 17 years annual ice velocities have decreased slightly
3535725 in earlier work lemke et al 2007 zwally et al 2002 it has been suggested that the interaction between meltwater production and ice velocity provides a positive feedback leading to a more rapid and stronger response of the ice sheet to climate warming than hitherto assumed
3535726 the englacial hydraulic system adjusts constantly to the variable meltwater input which results in a more or less constant ice flux over the years
3535727 may have only a limited effect on the response of the ice sheet to climate warming over the next decades
3535728 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
3535729 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
3535730 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
3535731 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
3535732 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3535733 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
3535734 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
3535735 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
3535736 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
3535737 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
3535738 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
3535739 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3535740 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
3535741 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
3535742 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
3535743 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
3535744 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3535745 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
3535746 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
3535747 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
3535748 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3535749 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
3535750 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
3535751 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
3535752 and the sad part is that it is keeping all of us from a having a real discussion on things that matter
3535753 as a black man in america i can never deny that race matters but i believe race is the red herring in this campaign folks have gone too far and are too sensitive
3535754 we should all agree that race is a part of this campaign once we acknowledge the elephant in the room perhaps we can start to figure out how to draw the line
3535755 to underscore growing u s concerns over its aging polar icebreaking

3535771 in countless public fora the bush administration has pledged its committment to georgias territorial integrity that committment has always been followed by the hope that all potential conflicts would be resolved peacefully administration officials insist that in private conversations at the highest levels they have told the georgians that their committment did not include military intervention on georgias behalf and say they have repeatedly urged the georgians not to provoke the russian bear but this stance gives rise to a question at natos most recent summit the administration pushed very hard to grant georgia a place on the initial rung of the ladder toward nato membership european governments blocked that attempt but u s remains committed to getting georgia into the atlantic alliance the definition of nato membership of course is a mutual defense committment an attack on one equals an attack on all are we ready to go into battle against russia to defend georgia in nato
3535772 this question has gotten pretty heavy coverage over the past week

3535776 republicans are moving to examine surges in voter registrations in some states a republican lawyers group held a national training session on election law over the weekend that included campaign attorneys for sen john mccain and other republican leaders one session discussed how party operatives can identify and respond to instances of voter fraud
3535777 republicans said they are particularly worried about prospects for fraud in virginia and pennsylvania and are beginning to comb thousands of new registrations in those states for ineligible applicants in some cases the huge numbers threaten to swamp their efforts and those of state and local governments to verify and process applications election officials in virginia and other states say there is no evidence of widespread fraud so far numerous studies have found fraud and other voting irregularities in past elections to be infrequent and generally not prevalent enough to influence the outcomes of most contests some republican lawyers say that despite the huge numbers of new registrations in some areas this years problems could be fewer compared to prior years because of improved procedures and tougher rules
3535778 regardless of how the voters got on the rolls johnson said the sheer number of democrats is a concern this year as is the fact that more hispanics are now registered democrats about 455 000 hispanics are now in the democratic party which only this year surpassed republicans who count 425 000 in their ranks compared to the last presidential election the numbers are even more dramatic for african americans more than 207 000 have joined the democratic party since 2004 accounting for 44 percent of the new voter growth
3535779 the boom that turned swamps and pastures into a suburban mecca has stopped dead now the talk is about plummeting home values rising food costs and gas prices that make the once painless half hour commute to tampa a financial strain its enough to give some here the sense that maybe this time around the republicans do not deserve their votes
3535780 even as younger voters are showing signs of breaking with years of lackluster turnout to support him obama is facing singular resistance from voters over 65 that age group turns out at the highest rate on election day and is disproportionately represented in the swing states of florida and pennsylvania bill clinton and al gore both relied on it in winning the democrats only popular vote majorities of the past two decades
3535781 with polls showing obama dominating among those under 40 and running even among middle aged voters republican john mccains lead among those 65 and older is the main reason he remains close overall his margin is largest among older white voters without a college education accounting for much of obamas problem with the white working class
3535782 by this time in 2004 president bushs re election campaign had spent 13 5 million on television in florida the president went on to win the state in november sen obamas ads have touched every media market in florida which is the most expensive for advertising among the closely fought states
3535783 how the gop is moving to examine these surges in the voting rolls
3535784 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
3535785 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
3535786 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
3535787 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
3535788 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
3535789 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
3535790 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
3535791 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
3535792 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
3535793 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
3535794 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
3535795 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
3535796 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
3535797 the problem of maximizing power from sunlight has been known for at least 30 years and is primarily one of physical limitations not engineering technology
3535798 there are good muslims and bad muslims that i have to admit just like there are good and bad jews
3535799 no this was their place first they could take the hot weather and some of them went far in this world theyre not lazy
3535800 i know hes smart i dont think hes a dummy like bush
3535801 im fine i have to go for blood work again they keep me waiting for an hour im all sunburned like a berry i get in the water and i forget to get out i get in conversations
3535802 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3535803 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3535804 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3535805 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3535806 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3535807 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3535808 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3535809 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3535810 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3535811 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3535812 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3535813 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3535814 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3535815 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3535816 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3535817 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3535818 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3535819 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3535820 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3535821 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3535822 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3535823 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3535824 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3535825 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3535826 historically presidential nominations were decided at the party conventions and as a result the vice presidential running mates were also selected at the conventions gallups jeff jones notes
3535827 that made it difficult to disentangle the effect of naming a vice presidential running mate on a candidates support from the
3535828 the small window of time after the announcement of a presidential candidates running mate but before the convention has taken place
3535829 similar to the pattern seen with clinton in 1996 support for gore held steady during bushs vice presidential selection phase at 41 percent
3535830 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3535831 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3535832 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3535833 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3535834 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3535835 just so you all know we did set a record
3535836 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3535837 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3535838 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3535839 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
3535840 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
3535841 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
3535842 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
3535843 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
3535844 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
3535845 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3535846 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
3535847 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
3535848 i have a recommendation but its not of a person and i shared this with them back in march
3535849 wait till the democrat convention is over and see who they pick youll have more information
3535850 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
3535851 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
3535852 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
3535853 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
3535854 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
3535855 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
3535856 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
3535857 we need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast
3535858 id love to have breakfast with you just the three of us without cameras and lights and tell you why i feel so strongly about this
3535859 utopians in the american vein who both believed in power but bridges wanted to see it redistributed abram wanted to see it concentrated
3535860 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
3535861 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
3535862 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
3535863 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
3535864 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
3535865 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
3535866 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
3535867 if black people kill black people every day why not have a week and kill white people
3535868 are you better off now than you were four years ago
3535869 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3535870 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3535871 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
3535872 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3535873 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3535874 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3535875 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3535876 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3535877 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3535878 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3535879 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3535880 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3535881 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
3535882 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
3535883 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3535884 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
3535885 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3535886 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
3535887 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
3535888 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
3535889 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
3535890 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
3535891 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
3535892 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
3535893 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
3535894 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
3535895 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
3535896 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
3535897 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
3535898 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
3535899 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
3535900 im having a belvedere in your honour the mountains are fantastic fabulous colours in the high desert will say hi at pasquals for you
3535901 i know there is a little mini panic going on in the ranks of not a few democrats and the chattering classes but with o in hawaii the nation on vacation the tv full of the olympics phelps romping in the pool and georgia on my mind i just want to say hey its august chill
3535902 the unreal is the paris britney obama glam rock nonsense the latest example of which is
3535903 the more team mccain does this as much as it obviously gets their ya yas out the more they demean their candidate
3535904 this country faces immense issues and it is not a time for insipid parodies and you know what the american people understand it and they want more from the men who are asking for their vote to be president of the united states so the mccain frat boys can act out as much as they want
3535905 the unreal is thinking that obama has peaked in the high 40s in virtually all the polls but not understanding that it is mccain who may have peaked in the low 40s where he has been stuck in virtually all the polls
3535906 what is real is race the industrial states and commander in chief
3535907 this election brings us into new territory the country has never gone through this before
3535908 you ask americans where georgia is and they think it is somewhere near atlanta
3535909 so the handwringers are wailing that we are only slightly up in august but guess what we are up in august and we will still peak in late october
3535910 hey you got sms in australia we want to text you on the vp the moment barack makes his decision as we told our troops
3535911 thanks for giving me an excuse to sip the belvedere love taos and santa fe chill baby
3535912 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3535913 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3535914 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3535915 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3535916 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3535917 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3535918 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3535919 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3535920 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3535921 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
3535922 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
3535923 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
3535924 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3535925 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3535926 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3535927 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3535928 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3535929 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3535930 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3535931 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3535932 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3535933 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3535934 treason fled before us for resistance was in vain while we were marching through georgia
3535935 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
3535936 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
3535937 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
3535938 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
3535939 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
3535940 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
3535941 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
3535942 design of experiments is the design of all information gathering exercises where variation is present whether under the full control of the experimenter or not
3535943 the two types of tests i will focus on are fractional factorial and full factorial
3535944 an essential primer on full and fractional factorial test design
3535945 its hard to find a serious advertiser who doesnt at least plan to do content testing this year
3535946 dont be shy big changes generally yield big differences in performance
3535947 we recommend letting your experiments run for at least two weeks no matter how much traffic you get and how strong the results initially appear just so the data has enough time to normalize
3535948 we found a bunch of maps to a bunch of businesses hand written maps with directions to businesses they apparently planned to hit or already hit
3535949 the majority were electric companies construction sites and almost every consumers energy substation and storage yard in the state
3535950 we are working to get further police reports and further suspect information
3535951 the suspects had parked a van on the edge of a wooded area
3535952 they were loading the van with some very expensive tools but when they saw police they ran into the woods
3535953 the dog got on the track and apprehended both suspects about a half mile away in a relatively short period of time
3535954 they were driving a vehicle belonging to a third person who happens to be on parole for breaking and entering
3535955 we inventoried the vehicle and found not only items from itc but also property belonging to another business j ranck electric which had its name engraved on its property
3535956 the first day of practice is always exciting whether you have a veteran team or a new team
3535957 it was a very good first practice they were very spirited
3535958 you need more water breaks and with higher temperatures the concentration level goes down
3535959 you cant make assumptions your players understand everything youre trying to get across
3535960 younger kids have got to learn your expectations and that takes two or three days
3535961 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
3535962 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
3535963 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
3535964 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
3535965 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
3535966 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
3535967 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
3535968 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3535969 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3535970 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3535971 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3535972 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3535973 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3535974 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3535975 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3535976 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3535977 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3535978 climate change will bring two new elements increased frequency and intensity and maybe new hazards to areas that have not experienced disasters
3535979 it doesnt matter whos emitting the green house gases everyone will feel the impact more so in vulnerable communities
3535980 cities need to understand that there are short term mid term and longer term actions that can and are being taken to build their resilience

3535982 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night

3535988 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
3535989 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
3535990 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world

3535996 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3535997 will provide clarity and certainty to the consultation process under the endangered species act
3535998 i am deeply troubled by this proposed rule which gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3535999 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government this is not the type of legacy this interior department should be leaving for future generations
3536000 clearly thats a case of asking the fox to guard the chicken coop
3536001 a giant caution light that made federal agencies stop and think about the impacts of their actions
3536002 what the bush administration is telling those agencies is they dont have to think about those impacts anymore
3536003 we have to have the ability to put our efforts where theyre needed
3536004 this really says to the agencies this law belongs to all of us
3536005 because it is not possible to link the emissions to impacts on specific listed species such as polar bears
3536006 so we dont inadvertently have the endangered species act seen as a back door to climate change policy that was never ever intended
3536007 clarity on an issue that if it was left broad and ambiguous could be a serious problem for the home building industry here in california
3536008 for home builders clarity in the rules is always always helpful
3536009 encouragement from both sides of the aisle to see if we couldnt bring about steps that would make the endangered species act more effective

3536035 if you offer five or six or seven cents difference the customer wins and hopefully youre able to hang onto a penny or two
3536036 they have to do the math to know the percentage of customers they need to convert to make it worth their while
3536037 some customers already pay with cash anyway so youre giving a few a discount that would have been one anyhow

3536060 its not like theres suddenly going to be a war between the two countries
3536061 in the absence of greater trust you will see a kind of pincer movement against pakistan by afghanistan and india and pakistans establishment and state turning toward whatever tools it has at its disposal to defend itself

3536086 some reports of indian peacekeepers being involved in sexual exploitation including child abuse have been received by the indian army
3536087 in keeping with the efforts to ensure the highest standards of discipline and conduct by the indian peacekeepers the vice chief of army staff lt gen m l naidu during his visit to the indian brigade in monuc on may 27 30 had directed that an internal inquiry be carried out by the commander there brigadier inderjeet narayan to examine the allegations and identify the defaulters if any
3536088 the inquiry is under judicial scrutiny and strict disciplinary action will be taken should any individual be found guilty
3536089 it has also been learnt that the office of internal oversight services oios of the un has also conducted an inquiry into the matter we would seek the details of this inquiry to corroborate augment the internal inquiry being conducted by the indian army
3536090 the indian army is committed to ensuring that necessary disciplinary action is taken against the individuals if proved guilty

3536119 frozen rivers account of two women who end up unlikely partners smuggling illegal immigrants over the canadian border is very much the vision of writer director courtney hunt who told the story first as a short film before expanding it to feature length
3536120 frozen rivers virtues start with its unusual setting the area around the town of massena in upstate new york just across the st lawrence river from canada and also home to a mohawk reservation that straddles the border with
3536121 frozen river is the way it initially emphasizes how unlikely partners like fire and ice these two exceptionally tough women are
3536122 frozen river asks is how much that communality will mean in the context of an uncaring unforgiving world it is a powerful question and the film answers it in the best way possible

3536148 the order of deportation is not a punishment but a method of ensuring the return to own country of an alien who has not complied with conditions hence bangladeshi nationals who have migrated illegally have no right to remain in india and they are liable to be deported

3536155 the issue is clear current regeneration policies are failing the very people they are supposed to be helping

3536159 it will only further deter students from the poorest backgrounds from going to university in the first place and the scottish labour party must stand on the side of students on this issue
3536160 i firmly believe that students who need to work alongside their degrees should not be taxed for doing so
3536161 people who deal with the public provide a great service to our society and should be able to go about their work without fear of attack or intimidation
3536162 i want to see the existing legislation widened to allow courts to deal with incidents as a specific offence carrying a maximum penalty of nine months in jail a fine of 5 000 or both
3536163 we are aware of jobs being cut the consequences on the wider legal profession could be disastrous
3536164 we are staring at a situation where there will be no career for the next generation of defence lawyers
3536165 we are seriously concerned about the situation and we cant wait for several months to talk about this and do something
3536166 we are going back to the scottish government with that at the end of the year

3536173 in de winter van 1937 werd in vlissingen een ouder echtpaar vermoord de uitbaters van het caf keersluis ondanks een uitgebreide speuractie van de politie werd het misdrijf nooit opgelost de schrijver heeft een minutieus onderzoek uitgevoerd naar alles wat met de zaak te maken had afkomst achtergronden geruchten doodlopende sporen buren en relaties alles wat maar enigszins in verband met het echtpaar kon worden gebracht daarbij krijgt de lezer een goed beeld van de vlissinger samenleving in de jaren dertig van de 20e eeuw de schrijver had niet de pretentie de moord te kunnen oplossen het was hem onder andere te doen om duidelijk te maken wat voor impact zon moord heeft op een toch vrij gesloten gemeenschap jaren later werd er nog over gepraat de schrijver is zeker geslaagd op boeiende en prettige wijze wordt verslag gedaan van het onderzoek waarbij men zich erover kan verbazen dat er nog zo veel bewaard is gebleven vele functionele fotos verluchtigen het geheel dat vooral voor mensen uit de stad en uit de streek interessant is
3536174 one thing about paris hilton and her energy policy is that she brings energy to about whatever she does and she said that she was hot that
3536175 i guarantee old or not with paris hilton talking about energy them fellas barack obama and john mccain will be listening probably watching too
3536176 we d bypass them evan williams fellas who tried to insert themselves into the political process and influence the voters of kentucky that re doing here we re trying to get the energy right view story

3536179 they have not yet shut down the building but the front entrance is now closed due to a swarm of bees huddling over and around their queen
3536180 i guess im in a period of thinking about film and filmmaking
3536181 she was so freaked out her eyes welled up and she actually bit her nails at one point
3536182 when someone pretended to dump estelle gettys ashes on 30 rock star jack mcbrayers head brooke got up and walked offstage
3536183 she watched the rest of the show from behind a curtain backstage with a grimace
3536184 actually a close up shot of tom sellecks magnum p i mustache
3536185 we dont know what hes complaining about he knew when he signed on that we were planning a shit movie with shit art he was like yeah like
3536186 this years weak economy has resulted in extremely volatile ad markets with major advertisers scrambling to allocate budgets where they will get the most bang for the buck
3536187 companies that publicly report ad sales for their cable nets showed positive second quarter results spanning a wide range from 1 to 28 however we expect to start seeing more negative numbers in the second half of 2008
3536188 bringing the oilers and the flames and the canucks in a rookie context to camrose is really going to be something special
3536189 it will be competitive to the max the line ups will be talented the stands will be full and the newspapers and press and media will be giving camrose its full and watchful eye
3536190 when youre in the big camp and youre a young player 18 or 19 years old and youre going up against sheldon souray youre a little bit timid you dont play the way you normally should so i think in games like this all three teams have the same scenario they are out to impress their bosses and their organization so it makes for good competition
3536191 weve got some very very good young players coming in weve got some high profile kids that we signed over the summer and its a good opportunity for them to showcase themselves
3536192 for the oilers organization to consider us is phenomenal and it just puts another notch in our belt in terms of the other global events well be hosting here
3536193 the oiler organization has a good fan base here but theyve always been really committed to the grassroots and were very appreciative of that
3536194 we anticipate a great turnout as this will be family affordable and it will be a great benefit for the kids to see the nhl come to town this is an exciting avenue for camrose to showcase the edgeworth centre and to display our strong hockey fanbase and our great volunteer force

3536199 a worldwide audience of billions swooned over the beijing ceremony
3536200 i dont think anybody really thought it would turn out like this
3536201 the roots of this tragedy lie in the decision of georgias separatist leaders in 1991 to abolish south ossetian autonomy this turned out to be a time bomb for georgias territorial integrity each time successive georgian leaders tried to impose their will by force both in south ossetia and in abkhazia where the issues of autonomy are similar it only made the situation worse new wounds aggravated old injuries
3536202 what happened on the night of aug 7 is beyond comprehension
3536203 the georgian military attacked the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali with multiple rocket launchers designed to devastate large areas russia had to respond to accuse it of aggression against small defenseless georgia is not just hypocritical but shows a lack of humanity
3536204 by declaring the caucasus a region that is thousands of miles from the american continent a sphere of its national interest the united states made a serious blunder
3536205 of course peace in the caucasus is in everyones interest but it is simply common sense to recognize that russia is rooted there by common geography and centuries of history russia is not seeking territorial expansion but it has legitimate interests in this region
3536206 dont worry im sure shell be able to get in by january

3536208 in the run up to the olympics it seems that chinese authorities are so obsessed with projecting an image of stability and harmony that they have really come down quite hard on human rights activists and lawyers
3536209 the peoples republic of china the olympics countdown broken promises
3536210 the chinese authorities have used the olympics and the cleanup before the olympics as an excuse to maintain and extend a draconian detention system that they had called re education through labor
3536211 what that really means is that theyre punished through forced labor to be taught a lesson and thousands of people who have ordinary complaints or demand reforms of the chinese government have instead been rounded up
3536212 we hope amnesty international can take off the colored glasses it has worn for many years and see china in an objective way
3536213 we are confident that the games coming to china not only promote our economy but also enhance all social conditions including education health and human rights
3536214 we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china
3536215 yes we promised to provide free access to the internet except for a few web sites that would jeopardize our national security and would not be good for the healthy growth of our young people
3536216 as in any other country there are some kinds of limitations however i think we are going to provide sufficient access for the media to cover the games
3536217 chinas political reality is a place where no freedom of expression will really be allowable this goes for the chinese people and the foreign journalists
3536218 china is always afraid that if it lets its own people speak freely and spontaneously organize by itself the chinese communist party could be endangered or even be threatened
3536219 they also feel since they got the olympics the world is coming anyway by this point they can just do what they want and just let the world tolerate rather than have to fundamentally change their own behavior
3536220 beijings public air quality reporting has been a misinformation campaign
3536221 individuals traveling to the 2008 olympic summer games should plan and prepare for the high levels of outdoor pollutant in beijing and limit or avoid outdoor exercise
3536222 this is really a significant opportunity lost for the chinese government to show to the world that they really trust their own people a sign of a china that is ready to take its place in the first ranks in the nations of the world
3536223 we started in my garage two years ago and were producing barrels today so things are moving pretty quickly
3536224 so these are bacteria that have been engineered to produce oil
3536225 they started off like regular lab bacteria that didnt produce oil but we took genes from nature we engineered them a bit and put them into this organism so that we can convert sugar to oil
3536226 if youve got something that you can make work in a test tube thats good but youve got to be able to make it work on a very large scale to have an impact on our petroleum imports
3536227 what weve done is make the same molecules from renewable sources so that it can go into the existing infrastructure be made domestically and in an environmentally friendly way thats the goal
3536228 you cant put ethanol in a pipeline and even your car needs some adjustments to it whereas the product were making is going into the existing system and thats a big difference
3536229 i doubt were going to completely eliminate our dependence on oil but well certainly be able to supplement the amount of oil we need in the short term
3536230 i think that the answer to reducing our petroleum import problem and reducing the carbon emissions from transportation is really threefold
3536231 it involves replacement fuels like biofuels it involves using much more efficient vehicles than we use today and it involves driving less
3536232 the fun of the challenge from the science perspective is that you do have farmers and biologists and entomologists and biochemists and chemical engineers and process engineers and business people and investors all working to solve this and it ranges anywhere from a political issue to a technical issue
3536233 honestly i couldnt think of a more exciting thing to work on as a scientist or technologist right now
3536234 part of the excitement comes from the fact that this is such a complex problem it cant be solved by a farmer or an ag expert and it cant be solved by a chemical engineer or a chemist
3536235 we all have to pool our various talents and training and try to come up with a whole new system of producing energy
3536236 and the current energy price environment has made literally everyone interested in replacements for petroleum
3536237 es muy importantes que todos realicemos esos cursos con el fin de garantizar un servicio de calidad cuando seamos reubicados en el edificio insimar
3536238 estamos de acuerdo con esta forma de adjudicaci n pues s lo de esta manera se evitar que los locales sean traspasados vendidos o alquilados
3536239 cuando me entreguen mi local eso va hacer una emoci n muy grande me imagino atendiendo al p blico en un hermoso local es un sue o que se va hacer realidad gracias al gobierno nacional
3536240 al inicio fue bastante fuerte pero la perseverancia y la constancia tiene sus fruto ya se lograron resolver algunas problem ticas y pronto estaremos disfrutando de nuestro locales en el edificio insimar
3536241 por la poca publicidad e informaci n sobre nuestra reubicaci n en la avenida casanova muchas personas desconocen que los buhoneros de sabana grande estas reubicados en esta feria
3536242 estamos totalmente de acuerdo ya que es necesario mantener la calidad de los servicios que favorecer tanto a los comerciantes como a los visitantes
3536243 chicos y chicas lean el libro en casa si tienen dudas uno por uno se las aclaro pueden hacer lo que quieran dentro de estas cuatro paredes hasta las 5 20pm lo que pasa en el aula se queda en el aula
3536244 its incredibly upsetting many of these staff have worked for us for many years
3536245 it is extremely hard on those who lost their job
3536246 the problem is we have a very strong program but it cant carry the weight of everything else
3536247 its very hard to make enough to cover overhead were not looking to make a profit but we have to be able to cover payroll
3536248 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3536249 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3536250 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3536251 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3536252 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3536253 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3536254 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3536255 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3536256 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3536257 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3536258 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3536259 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3536260 i have never made but one prayer to god a very short one o lord make my enemies ridiculous and god granted it
3536261 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3536262 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3536263 mr quattrone is right that the pendulum has probably swung too far and in the cool light of day it might be time to lift some of the restrictions
3536264 analysts should be allowed to talk to their own investment bankers on occasion
3536265 still doesnt grok that analysts are meant to work for investors not investment bankers
3536266 creates the potential for heightened legal and business risk exposures for the purchasers or assignees of these loans
3536267 in ways we have no way of monitoring and preventing
3536268 many countless people have given generously of their time money and effort to help make this dream become a reality now the larger community of plumas county has a historic architectural gem they can all be proud of
3536269 wed come to a roadblock and out of the blue someone would say we can do that
3536270 i dont think theres a recession in the real estate market i think theres a depression
3536271 challenging even dismal real estate market weve seen in the last year or two probably more
3536272 itll come back but were not sure when we think theres one or two more years in this recession
3536273 were ready to build we still have the financial ability to carry this property for a couple more years weve got probably two and a half million bucks into this thing so its not like we want to walk away the development agreement is very important to us because it creates the value and the certainty both to us and prospective lender
3536274 i have to also mention that you folks bought the property and could have developed it in the highest market that has ever occurred in this county and did not if you had hurried and developed it two to three years ago you would have been in at the very top and that didnt happen instead you requested an extension
3536275 three years ago we were pretty much ready for construction but we didnt have water we lost a year because we had to get water because water wasnt available through the city
3536276 once we got the water resolved we then had to work on the infrastructure improvements which we did in 05 and 06
3536277 we just feel honored to be considered the beneficiaries of such an event weve had a lot of excitement from our employees and from the community about the event
3536278 i looked in her eyes and realized she was looking at the cockpit i positioned myself in front of the cockpit
3536279 i still was trying to understand what was going on because it happened so quick my main concern was i wasnt going to let this lady in the cockpit
3536280 can you look into my eyes and tell me where i am going to go
3536281 i asked her to calm down when she came to me she was very upset she was shaking her sunglasses in my face
3536282 i asked her what could i do for you i did everything i thought i could do in that situation
3536283 how in the world can that happen the answer is you dont know
3536284 i want her to admit she did something wrong i think people need to be held accountable for their actions
3536285 ms brown is it possible you have a history of perceiving things entirely different than they really happened
3536286 i didnt want to lose my job because i felt i had to take a stand
3536287 i felt i was no longer going to allow people to get away with bad behavior i was very nervous about my job situation
3536288 they have intrusive recollections i keep remembering it i have nightmares about it i cant escape it
3536289 its not like you live at fort hood or camp lejeune and everybody on your street is in the military
3536290 they have intrusive recollections i keep remembering it i have nightmares about it i cant escape it
3536291 its not like you live at fort hood or camp lejeune and everybody on your street is in the military
3536292 we need to be cautious with what were allowing someone to do and at what point in their recovery theyre allowed to do it
3536293 to keep the brain stimulated but not enough to push it into overdrive
3536294 whether its pop warner football or soccer or high school teams
3536295 its difficult for them to realize this one game friday night is not as important as my cognitive ability the rest of my life
3536296 this is not a novel to be tossed lightly aside it should be thrown with great force
3536297 overall they both have a decent chance of developing over the next couple of days
3536298 right now its over warm waters and general conditions appear favorable for development
3536299 was able to get 3 great offers in less than 24 hours
3536300 met all my needs being able to search for loans in a way that puts me in control
3536301 the hayes family is comfortable with dr kraus recommendation to not conduct an autopsy
3536302 it was in this atmosphere of desenga o of national disillusionment that cervantes wrote his don quixote of which the first part appeared in 1605 and the second in 1614 here among many other parables was the parable of a nation which had set out on its crusade only to learn that it was tilting at windmills in the end was the desenga o for ultimately the reality would always break in on the illusion the events of the 1590s had suddenly brought home to more thoughtful castilians the harsh truth about their native land its poverty in the midst of riches its power that had shown itself impotent brought face to face with the terrible paradoxes of the castile of philip iii a host of public spirited figures such men as gonzalez de cellorgigo and sancho de moncada set themselves to analyse the ills of an ailing society it is these men known as arbitristas projectors who give the castilian crisis of the turn of the century its special character for this was not only a time of crisis but a time also of the awareness of crisis of bitter realization that things had gone wrong it was under the influence of the arbitristas that early seventeenth century castile surrendered itself to an orgy of national introspection desperately attempting to discover at what point reality had been exchanged for illusion
3536303 grow a garden every year preserve food and know how to brew beer amp wine raise chickens and slaughter sheep
3536304 its incredibly upsetting many of these staff have worked for us for many years
3536305 it is extremely hard on those who lost their job
3536306 the problem is we have a very strong program but it cant carry the weight of everything else
3536307 its very hard to make enough to cover overhead were not looking to make a profit but we have to be able to cover payroll
3536308 after 11 days notice of the meeting cr chetwynd e mailed me as mayor 36 minutes before the meeting was due to proceed on behalf of the three councillors stating that they did not consider that the meeting should proceed as they did not believe the business to be considered was an ongoing matter
3536309 the matters were with respect to a resolution made on july 25 enabling neram ltd to proceed with councils support to the supreme court and an in private matter dealing with the university of new englands supreme court application
3536310 for us tamworth really epitomises what country energy should be and that is to live and work in the bush and be a success
3536311 we will be launching a new intelligent network and given that tamworth started 20 years ahead of the rest with electric street lighting we would like to stay ahead of our competitors
3536312 basically we are looking at how we can use the network
3536313 at the moment our power lines shunt along reasonably boring electricity and what we want to expand into is data high tech metering and more efficient electricity provision
3536314 if we can do it smarter we can drop costs and we would like to motivate the key movers and shakers here to go back to their teams and likewise motivate them
3536315 he was not recognised enough for what he achieved he did big things in america and every year would perform at the showground in the rodeo arena for country music week
3536316 its history now and he wont be forgotten weve had a few people in here to visit after his death
3536317 he will be missed not only by country music but in the rodeo world as well
3536318 the last time i saw him was here in tamworth in the 1990s after he had his first stroke
3536319 he rode a horse through to rodeo arena and sang for the audience
3536320 he was underestimated he started off in south australia in the 1950s with the country western hour
3536321 he was one of the pioneers of country music who went from a bush kid to a top country music singer and was given the industrys highest honour the role of renown in 1984
3536322 i think if kevin rudd wants to get in next term he should do something about it the pension crisis pronto
3536323 as far as theyre the government concerned we might be useless but we can still vote
3536324 i agree with mr windsor well and truly there should be a 30 increase
3536325 the utility allowance was very handy and so was the 500 in june but every pay day i know i have to cut back onsomething
3536326 its difficult to get together with friends and talk about these issues with the price of fuel at the moment
3536327 its not getting worse but its not getting better either
3536328 here we are on a massive surplus and our governments have no moral conscience to bring us up to standards
3536329 a lot of us will be dead by 2010 and there is no guarantee that the cost of living will decrease
3536330 its by far getting worse we can no longer afford to live but we cant afford to die either
3536331 as you know the cost of living keeps going up
3536332 the government had all this information in the senate inquiry last year
3536333 the governments of the nation have no social conscience that the older generation havent got enough to live in
3536334 we are so deprived of necessities in the real sense if we got 30 extra in our pension we would be expanding our budget to take on the necessities of life
3536335 we didnt have a representative from the tamworth office but raine and horne did have a display at the expo and there have been a lot of positive things said from it
3536336 mainly what we are hearing is that sydney siders have had a gutful of traffic and congestion on the roads and basically they just want to get out
3536337 now add to that the fact they can come here and buy a brand new or near new four bedroom double garage home for between 300 000 and 400 000 and you can see why tamworth is so attractive
3536338 we have received some very strong leads from country week and at less than an hour from sydney by plane why wouldnt someone come up and see what we have to offer
3536339 it puts us on a very good footing and makes us a very affordable location compared to sydney
3536340 however i would encourage anyone thinking of putting their property on the market to do so because it is a very good time to sell
3536341 the number of properties on the market overall is down and we need new properties so when people from out of town come enquiring we have a good range to show them
3536342 they were coming in droves for a while because we had good prices and good yields
3536343 most country towns are flat and uninteresting but we are fortunate in having mountains and hills and i always say our hills are out water views
3536344 the premeditated slaying of john lennon with an essentially clear mind
3536345 your conduct thus precipitated a horrendously tragic event which has impacted many individuals
3536346 your discretionary release at this time would thus not be compatible with the welfare of society at large and would tend to deprecate the seriousness of the instant offence and undermine respect for the law
3536347 there was so much paparazzi that its really hard to get to know the girl because theyre all over the place

3536386 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
3536387 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
3536388 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
3536389 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
3536390 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
3536391 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
3536392 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
3536393 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
3536394 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
3536395 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
3536396 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
3536397 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
3536398 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
3536399 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
3536400 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
3536401 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
3536402 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
3536403 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
3536404 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
3536405 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it

3536409 we decided to put lin miaoke on the live picture while using yang peiyis voice
3536410 the reason for this is we must put our countrys interest first the girl on the picture must be flawless in terms of her facial expression and the great feeling she can give to people
3536411 this is like a voice over for a cartoon character why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer

3536422 the first unhcr humanitarian airlift flight carrying relief supplies for civilians affected by the conflict arrived in georgia this morning as the estimated number of people uprooted by the fighting approached 100 000
3536423 that would amount to some 56 000 people from gori on the move officials said that most had gone toward tbilisi and that most would return home once the threat subsided
3536424 the situation on the ground is deteriorating sparking a significant movement of population
3536425 we need unrestricted humanitarian access to the civilian population and to the wounded and to enable medical personnel and ambulances to take care of the dead and wounded
3536426 one of our top priorities when it is possible will be to get safe drinking water to tskhinvali

3536438 all who served with erin wanted to be beside him especially at the most dangerous times of the mission
3536439 he could raise morale with a look a gesture or a practical joke
3536440 he passed on all the wealth of his experience to his platoon when he spoke they listened and he never had to repeat himself twice when correcting a soldier
3536441 im personally inspired every day by all the soldiers across the battle group but there are a few across the battle group who inspire me a little more when i come across them and doyle was one of those guys

3536444 the overwhelming majority of republican senators have pledged to protect october 1 as american energy freedom day so we can reduce dependence on foreign oil and lower the cost of gas at the pump
3536445 many people arent aware that the bans on drilling must be renewed every year and all we have to do is allow these prohibitions to expire on october 1 in just 50 days americans will have the freedom to pursue their own energy resources here at home our letter is very straightforward we will actively oppose any effort to extend the bans on offshore drilling and oil shale
3536446 isnt this the same day that republicans would be endangering the delivery of social security checks because of their misguided attempts to promote energy policies that will do nothing to deal with the short term problems facing the country
3536447 we can do that we can have a vote on oil drilling

3536645 he really loves cycling loves the sport and was determined to keep this race alive he pulled the plug last year because he only wants to put on a good race and he didnt think he could put on the race that it deserves to be
3536646 the first time this race was held at the national level high altitude mountain goat scott moninger won
3536647 i love high altitude mountain goat climbing but american stage racing has always been on the short side in terms of big mountain climbs garmin chipotle is bringing have an amazing team im excited to have guys like pete stetina and blake caldwell do great rides in a field like this they are some of the best climbers in the country its exciting to race with young guys like this as well as experienced guys like danny pate and will frischkorn we know we have some big challenges ahead with the weather the heat the climbing the altitude and the competition
3536648 its certainly going to be more than just garmin chipotle versus rock racing
3536649 chris baldwin could do a good ride and health net is bringing phil zajicek who is always a classy rider along with rory sutherland
3536650 i dont know how rory is riding right now but earlier this season he was going as fast as anyone ive ever seen in europe
3536651 i raced in elk grove two weeks ago and really didnt feel myself
3536652 this week my stomach has been really been bothering me so im heading in to have some tests done ive been trying to wait it out but id better take care of it now
3536653 before we raced in china sevilla didnt train at altitude and he did really well he was really strong
3536654 and ever since hes been altitude training in columbia so he should be very good
3536655 with danielson im not sure how hes feeling whether or not hes bringing his a game then again even his b game could be good enough ive seen some of those young guys on garmin guys like peter stetina hes ready
3536656 and now that ive got it im not about to let it go away
3536657 we motor paced the other day and i wished i looked like him on the bike
3536658 weve been acclimatizing to the altitude everyone is in good spirits and weve certainly confirmed that the race will be very very hard
3536659 we not only have a team of good climbers but a group of guys who perform very well at high altitude
3536660 and those two things dont always go hand in hand there are some really big hard stages during the event and on a sporting level the race will be extremely interesting and difficult

3536700 man the effects of a cup of coffee a hydrocodone a hard day at work the effect on the consciousness is astounding dont say that the consciousness is not astounding
3536701 thats right it is man i used to get obliterated i mean high or on whatever and i have seen my consciousness under some very heavy and strange conditions
3536702 oh me too i have seen it and done it it is no surprise for me anymore
3536703 and the world the world is a strange and miraculous thing we do not know where it resides this world nor from where it came from
3536704 no we do not know these things nor do we know the cause of our own arising from where does my consciousness arise does it reside here within the body
3536705 it is quite possible though perhaps it is this body which resides in my consciousness
3536706 and i too am a question and perhaps am its answer a living answer and a living question
3536707 and where is god is he or she here in this question
3536708 perhaps perhaps god is here in this question and perhaps god is above it
3536709 perhaps it is god that ascends and descends from this question above it and then descends within it
3536710 god is here in this question it is here that we continue to know and then to unknow what we have known ascending and descending in our comprehension of the logos god is the logos and we are the question

3536715 we have to decide if that is the best place for the facility and what the residents want
3536716 the council will take into account how often the facility is used and how much it has cost in terms of repair bills
3536717 this is a great free picnic spot for families and now a few have ruined it for everyone
3536718 it is a catch 22 because people should be allowed to have the freedom to have a party but when they go and do this it ruins it for everyone else

3536723 im in the emergency department once a fortnight due to the gall stone attacks

3536726 everybody knows that the hospital needs to be expanded but our productivity is declining due to the fact that it is a log jam
3536727 weve been told that we need to work within the constraints of the facility
3536728 weve got an unexpectedly large amount of potholes in the work despite all the care that was taken its a bit of a mystery
3536729 weve had the roads and traffic authority and our experts looking at it but none of us really knows why it has performed that way it should have been fine
3536730 we obviously want the product to be way better than that at the end of the day
3536731 that seal is only an interim seal ultimately there will be an asphalt seal

3536734 that has not been made public and attains or aids another to attain a benefit
3536735 he needs to write a memo to explain why he did what he did
3536736 our life together would be a never ending arguement about this and that we would want to strangle each other everyday we both we be driven crazy by the other but what the rest of the world wouldnt know is that we loved each other every single second of every single day we were together until the day we die
3536737 just wait there will be an opening somewhere really soon cause someone else got tired of the bs too
3536738 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3536739 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3536740 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3536741 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3536742 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3536743 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3536744 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3536745 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3536746 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3536747 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3536748 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3536749 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3536750 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3536751 we designed the computer simulations to show that as the ocean temperature increased hurricanes would form more rapidly and easily even in the presence of wind shear
3536752 instead we got exactly the opposite result as the water temperature increased the effectiveness of the wind shear in suppressing hurricane formation actually became greater
3536753 the additional aspect that our method offers is a much more accurate picture of the process of tropical storm and hurricane formation as compared to the global models
3536754 our ongoing work with this model and others should lead to a much better understanding of the relationship between climate and global hurricane activity

3536757 the only responsibility the council has to us is to maintain our roads and yet we see nothing just further deterioration of already shoddy dirt roads
3536758 the maintenance effort has increased over the last 18 months to two years
3536759 gravel roads are always going to be rougher than sealed roads in urban areas by the nature of gravel roads
3536760 im trying to force the council to take their rural roads seriously
3536761 i think you will find there is a fairly common complaint with rural residents
3536762 but the tourists dont just come to see the sea they also come inland to experience the outstanding natural beauty of our rural areas to enjoy the rivers mountain streams rainforest and rolling pasture
3536763 solar electricity is not only clean and renewable but also a good investment ms lopert said
3536764 for about a 2500 outlay for a 1kw system you save about 250 each year on your electricity bills
3536765 thats 10 per cent return on your investment and the government cant tax it
3536766 as electricity goes up in price and it will the return on your investment is even greater

3536785 the disruption of the btc pipeline would undoubtedly offer a nice bonus to russia by diverting azerbaijani oil exports along russian routes but the scale of the gain is not worth all the human and reputation losses the russian government has committed itself to in the operation in georgia
3536786 according to many there are many untapped hydrocarbon resources in the caspian sea bordering azerbaijan
3536787 to others the resources of the region are not enough to undertake major export projects such as the nabucco gas pipeline from the caspian across the caucasus and turkey to central europe and italy
3536788 the war in georgia may confirm the existing doubts about the reliability of georgia as a transit country
3536789 this may lead not only to political reluctance towards the nabucco project but also to decreasing investors confidence
3536790 it is too early to tell in what extent the war in georgia will affect the overall price of oil
3536791 oil prices may be affected only on a temporary basis leaving the major responsibility of determining the new level of oil prices to other trends and factors like the recent decrease in us energy demand and the recent increase in oil production in saudi arabia
3536792 more effective and agile in managing trends in the financial industry
3536793 some of the theses weaknesses such as the blurring of the true risk reward profile of individual businesses are the source of substantial risk as we have seen in the past few months
3536794 there were grave management errors at the very top and inappropriate risk management which is of course the biggest sin a bank can do

3536823 its time to move from words to action because this is not going to go away this nation is fighting for its survival but we are also fighting for world peace and we are also fighting for a future world order
3536824 i have to do the cheesecake or some variation of it
3536825 its one of those things that people come for that you always have to have
3536826 i want everything on the menu to be a signature dish i have to believe it is all of that quality
3536827 but there are certain things the customers expect you can suggest the specials maybe the lobster ravioli or the lamb chops i love them all but they come back to the ossobusco al bosco
3536828 even if you dont intend for it to be your signature it can turn out that way if the customers love it and expect it from you
3536829 i wanted to do something a little different and the small plate concept really appealed to me
3536830 i think people have gotten away from the big entree i noticed so many people ordering off the appetizer menu i decided to focus on a selection of small entrees people could share
3536831 nothing fancy just five ingredients but its the one thing always in my repertoire even my mom has to have it and i would make anything on the menu for her
3536832 over the top is how i would describe its popularity
3536833 you can only get it on monday for a reason it develops a following it brings people in who might not otherwise check us out and my hope is that their eye goes to other parts of the menu and they see something else they want to try its a no brainer if its good they will come
3536834 it is a good thing and bad thing to be known for something
3536835 but we prided ourselves on being as organic as possible and serving things that were as fresh as possible and natural the jar was a way to showcase what we were doing once it caught on i had to have it
3536836 and probably some cheesecake in fact i may just have the cheesecake
3536837 i may change it a little but it still has to taste the same

3536839 we think we can gain a lot of efficiency by having it under one roof we have to send staff to multiple locations were filling orders daily from multiple locations having all of our inventory centrally located will be operationally efficient for us
3536840 we will continue to do things that are in the best long term interest of our facility and our employees
3536841 i just had a few hundred pieces stored in my attic and i did mail order just from my house
3536842 there was a real demand from people who were looking for a lot of pieces with these old patterns that they couldnt find anywhere else and just from right off our business continued to grow from the very beginning
3536843 should not be surprised at the nationalism of kashmiris there has been a facade of normalcy in kashmir tourists coming and mobile phones arriving do not mean that people are not angry
3536844 wasted chances to come up with a creative solution with pakistan and kashmiris
3536845 i think the blockade made people realise that kashmir at the moment totally depends on india and that we need to be economically independent
3536846 the excessive and unwarranted use of force against the people of indian occupied kashmir
3536847 these statements constitute clear interference in the internal affairs of an integral part of india such statements by leaders of a foreign country do not help the situation nor do they contribute to creating the atmosphere necessary for the dialogue process between india and pakistan to move forward
3536848 the first thing is the whole event is very undesirable in terms of both the domestic situation and its linkage with the larger bilateral peace process
3536849 i see this will have a bad impact and considering that pakistan is going through a bad turmoil now the overall impact on the peace process will not be very positive
3536850 like a four year old trying to hit the bell on a test your strength machine
3536851 we do not yet have a peace deal we have a provisional cessation of hostilities but this is significant progress
3536852 the difference between lunatics and other people is that when they smell blood it is very difficult to stop them
3536853 we will be forced to take other measures to prevent any repetition of the situation that emerged because of the outrageous georgian aggression
3536854 plain and simple blatant aggression on the part of russia
3536855 they shot their brother russian peacekeepers then they finished them off with bayonets so we are not going to see them there any more
3536856 there are a few things that need to be discussed to get a full ceasefire
3536857 the russians are saying that they will never again accept georgians in any form in south ossetia they see them as a trojan horse that started the attacks last week
3536858 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
3536859 abkhazia and ossetia if i mention territorial integrity are to the best of my knowledge part of georgia
3536860 nato is not seeking a direct role or a military role in this conflict
3536861 require the signing of a legally binding treaty on the non use of force
3536862 why are people waving flags its not as if we won

3536865 fifty percent of those incidents were in high schools 49 percent in middle schools 1 percent in elementary
3536866 whats important to know about those numbers is that that could be anything from having illustrations on a notebook hand signs its not necessarily something that is violent
3536867 we relocated here from washington d c where gangs are a huge problem
3536868 i think it should concern any parent if there is any gang related information but i think what we have to do as a society is keep working with our local schools and the school board to make sure the problems that we found in d c do not come to north carolina
3536869 we need to be concerned citizens to make sure that there is zero tolerance for gang activity
3536870 i always do and havent had any problems and havent had the flu in a long time so i think its worth doing
3536871 in the u s 200 000 people every year are hospitalized because of the flu and about 36 000 people die every year from the flu so it can be a very serious disease
3536872 it used to be recommended that kids from six months to 5 years old get a flu vaccine
3536873 now its been expanded to kids from six months to 18 years get a flu vaccine every year
3536874 theres not the need for principals and staff to be monitoring student dress because everyones dressed appropriately so that saves time and puts more focus on the academics to where it needs to be

3536895 the smaller the items were the more likely they were to have been stolen
3536896 there is little chance the mpc will cut rates in the next few months and indeed there remains a near term risk that the mpc will hike rates if inflation expectations surge higher again
3536897 the rise in core inflation will clearly leave the mpc concerned that even the sharp slowdown in activity now under way will not be severe enough to prevent a more broad based pick up in inflation while we still think that the mpc could cut interest rates before the end of the year a cut within the next couple of months looks well off the agenda indeed a rate rise is still a possibility
3536898 the most important concern up and down the country is the deteriorating state of our economy hundreds of thousands of families now have the threat of negative equity hanging over them businesses are cutting back unemployment is creeping up and this mornings inflation figures are yet another worrying signal for families desperately trying to make ends meet
3536899 its very clear that were in for a dose of stagflation with the economy slowing abruptly and inflation too high and increasing
3536900 i think everybody recognises that it is not possible for governments to fully insulate whether it is households or businesses from these kinds of world oil prices that we have seen
3536901 the aviation industry has always been a barometer of the wider economy so it should not come as any surprise to see a slight slowdown particularly since the airlines have signalled some cutbacks to services

3536910 my personal view is that these conditions could continue until 2010 or even 2011 these are most difficult economic circumstances we have ever seen
3536911 we would hesitate before automatically extrapolating the recent price trend

3536923 this is an obvious and predictable attempt to deflect attention from alpas illegal activity cited in our lawsuit which details the organised and concerted effort to harm our customers our employees and our performance

3536932 we believe ubs investment bank will not be fully owned and even potentially disposed of by ubs over the next two years
3536933 some of these weaknesses such as the blurring of the true risk reward profile of individual businesses are the source of substantial risk as we have seen in the past few months
3536934 net new money a key indicator of client confidence in ubs was weaker than we had expected the sfr5 5bn outflow from swiss wealth management clients was particularly notable and primarily reflects portfolio diversification in response to ubss reputational damage
3536935 no doubt some people will claim that these proposals are unworkable unreasonable and perhaps plain barmy
3536936 but the issue is clear internal migration has always been an important part of a dynamic economy
3536937 if we are to ensure that people in this country have similar opportunities regardless of where they are born we need to allow people to move from places with few prospects to places that offer more opportunities
3536938 all towns and cities should have the right to determine their own policies and their local councils should be assessed regularly and accurately and the results of such assessment explained to local people
3536939 we are seeing a softening or a tempering or some slowing of revenue growth in particular in financial markets but its not nearly to the level that people have been worrying about
3536940 people were thinking we would go negative growth in the second half but all the businesses are quite positive the picture the way i see it is a slight slowing in keeping with the general economy which is slowing down but not the sort of falling out of bed we are seeing in media or some of the banking sector
3536941 people are feeling a little better than they did a few weeks ago but thats fragile and that could change

3536947 frozen rivers account of two women who end up unlikely partners smuggling illegal immigrants over the canadian border is very much the vision of writer director courtney hunt who told the story first as a short film before expanding it to feature length
3536948 frozen rivers virtues start with its unusual setting the area around the town of massena in upstate new york just across the st lawrence river from canada and also home to a mohawk reservation that straddles the border with
3536949 frozen river is the way it initially emphasizes how unlikely partners like fire and ice these two exceptionally tough women are

3536951 we are certainly having to be a bit more careful with the values of houses we are putting on the market

3537012 these reductions will provide some relief for customers coming off fixed rate were seeing strong competition in the market and some easing in fixed rates and that adds up to a good result for customers

3537015 many of britains towns and cities have failed and been failed by policy makers for too long
3537016 coastal cities whether large like liverpool and hull or small like scunthorpe and blackpool are most vulnerable they are almost always at the end of the line they have lost their raison detre as ports and it is hard to imagine them prospering at their current sizes
3537017 sunderland demonstrates just how hard it is to regenerate such a city it is time to stop pretending there is a bright future for sunderland and ask ourselves instead what we need to do to offer people in sunderland better prospects

3537021 growth in green investment is expected on the basis of growth in the green sector
3537022 looking ahead environmental concerns and means of sustainable development will increasingly weigh on business and investor decisions that coupled with the sheer size of the energy market and the fundamental need for energy to drive economic growth underpins the long term viability of green investing
3537023 in line with the scope of analysis this report does not address the regional differences in hnwi preferences at a granular level nor does it attempt to explain variations in social or cultural motivations across regions
3537024 that said possible explanations may lie in european cultures longstanding commitment to environmental preservation and the development of green initiatives while middle eastern economies may want to retain their historical positions of net providers of energy into the future by pioneering green initiatives and or implementing economically viable solutions on a mass scale
3537025 given the high development risk associated with the sector green investing caters largely to institutions and hnwis more sophisticated investors willing to assume greater financial risk in hopes of high returns
3537026 slightly more than one half of hnwis globally allocate to green investing primarily on the basis of investment return whereas roughly one third point to social responsibility as their motivating factor this trend holds true in all regions but north america where a majority of hnwis claim social responsibility as their primary reason for participating in green investing
3537027 in only four years the equator principles moved from having 10 member banks to 55 banks that is still a tiny proportion of the banking business compared with mainstream syndicated lending but it has raised awareness of environmental risk in banks which might have started to look at ways to include different types of screening for environment risk in their lending processes

3537030 as far as we in the government are concerned a victim of rape is not in any way at all culpable due to alcohol consumption
3537031 as i understand it the cica have accepted that the guidelines were being misapplied i hope that the compensation authority will look at these other cases that they believe may also have had the guidelines misinterpreted and review them without the victims themselves having to go back and ask for that review
3537032 if an applicant accepts our decision then that case is finalised and closed
3537033 if they wish to ask for a review they must do this themselves in writing
3537034 contributed to the circumstances which gave rise to the injury
3537035 old prejudices like if a woman is wearing a short skirt or acting in a certain way are still operational
3537036 by reducing compensation because a woman has been drinking the cica is operating under those old prejudices
3537037 the scheme was originally applied wrongly in this case but this was corrected at review and the award was paid in full
3537038 it is not our policy to reduce the level of award to a victim of rape due to alcohol consumption this supports our view that a victim of rape is not in anyway culpable due to alcohol consumption
3537039 a victim of rape should not have any compensation reduced because of their drinking i hope that the compensation authority will look at these other cases

3537045 i joined the unit more or less agnostic on drugs policy being personally opposed to drug use but open minded about the best way to deal with the problem
3537046 i was certainly not inclined to decriminalise however during my time in the unit as i saw more and more evidence of what works to quote new labours mantra of the time it became apparent to me that enforcement and supply side interventions were largely pointless they have no significant lasting impact on the availability affordability or use of drugs
3537047 i think what was truly depressing about my time in ukadcu was that the overwhelming majority of professionals i met including those from the police the health service the government and voluntary sectors held the same view the illegality of drugs causes far more problems for society and the individual than it solves yet publicly all those intelligent knowledgeable people were forced to repeat the nonsensical mantra that the government would be tough on drugs even though they all knew the governments policy was actually causing harm
3537048 tobacco is a legal drug whose use is declining and precisely because it is legal its users are far more amenable to government control education programmes and taxation

3537050 julian critchley is one of the brave few to tell the truth about the failure of prohibition and the need to replace it with a system of regulation

3537263 there is a powerful human impulse known as the rule of rescue to attempt to help an identifiable person whose life is in danger no matter how much it costs

3537269 the values of the democratic party the efforts to take america in a new direction and to reach out to all voters in particular new voters independents and republicans to get the country moving in the right direction at this critical time
3537270 the barack obama she knows and loves the values that shape him and why she believes hell be an extraordinary president
3537271 im kind of nervous so you do all the talking
3537272 what would happen if we it stopped supporting the end user and we simply only supported from the corporate network in

3537274 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3537275 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3537276 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3537277 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3537278 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3537279 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3537280 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3537281 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3537282 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3537283 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3537284 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3537285 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3537286 i have a short attention span so i need you to sum it all up into one word
3537287 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3537288 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3537289 los magos son artistas de la atenci n y la consciencia manipulan estos procesos cognitivos de forma dram tica actuaci n tras actuaci n
3537290 el mago no s lo desv a la atenci n de los espectadores a nivel espacial sino tambi n temporal es probable que el truco lo haya realizado antes de que parezca que lo est haciendo el lenguaje corporal y la posici n de los ojos tambi n son fundamentales cuando hacen magia su cuerpo siempre est relajado lo que da la impresi n de que no sucede nada y entra en tensi n cuando fingen que algo importante est ocurriendo
3537291 ves una cosa y luego sucede otra lo que nos hace concluir que la primera es causa de la segunda cuando no tiene por qu ser as
3537292 sus espect culos suelen recordarse por una serie de momentos puntuales los m s espectaculares pero que no son determinantes para desvelar el truco para eso tendr amos que grabar la actuaci n en v deo y visionarla varias veces fij ndonos en un punto distinto en cada ocasi n a n as es posible que no logremos comprenderlo
3537293 debe parecer que cada movimiento tiene un objetivo nunca repetir de manera exacta el mismo truco y emplear la aparente repetici n para cerrar todas las puertas a cualquier posible explicaci n del truco que no sea la magia
3537294 llevar estas t cnicas al laboratorio podr a ampliar el conocimiento sobre las bases neuronales y la comprensi n de los mecanismos que controlan la atenci n c mo funcionan y c mo manipularlos
3537295 sabemos que un conjunto de magos lee revistas de divulgaci n cient fica y presta mucha atenci n a las neurociencias cognitivas sin embargo la comunidad neurocient fica no atiende a los magos a pesar de que hay quien sostiene que es un arte que ya estaba presente en el antiguo egipto

3537302 the governments failure to act unfairly had left many people in limbo now they will be able to vote and participate fully in civic life
3537303 we are pleased that through this agreement hundreds of lawful permanent residents will finally have their naturalization applications adjudicated as the law requires
3537304 this suggestion that plaintiffs should be resigned to participate vicariously in civic society is shocking offensive and wrong it echoes the sentiments of those who challenged womans suffrage suggesting that women should be content to participate in the political process vicariously through their husbands votes
3537305 antidoping authorities have fostered a sporting culture of suspicion secrecy and fear
3537306 encourage more sensible informed use of drugs in amateur sport leading to an overall decline in the rate of health problems associated with doping

3537308 the claims of the common fatal or irreversible harms of anabolic steroids are without any medical foundation theres no reason to think the risk of injury or death is as high as the risk from simply playing sports like football or baseball

3537319 why wont america and nato help us if they wont help us now why did we help them in iraq
3537320 the russians will be here tomorrow they want to show us and the world how powerful they are tomorrow it will be ukraine and nobody in the west is doing anything to stop them why were our soldiers in kosovo and iraq if we dont get any help from the west now
3537321 many officials in the u s government who have worked on the russia relationship in recent years said president bush lionized mr saakashvili as a model for democracy in the region to a point that the georgian leader may have held unrealistic expectations about the amount of support he might receive from the us and the west
3537322 hmmm thats a good question let me think about that for a second
3537323 im not really sure im going to have to think about that for a bit and get back to you
3537324 im not sure to be honest what do you think
3537325 ive never really considered that perhaps you can expand the question a little and we can explore it right now
3537326 im not sure how we would deal with a sudden spike in the cost of bandwidth we would have to collect more information and answer that question down the road

3537328 hes rather like a farmer d or an herbal ed smith except in the field of aromatherapy and essential oils
3537329 he travels all over the world searching out the best sources for his high quality oils and approaches it from a health oriented approach based on traditional indian ayurvedic background so its not your typical lets make something that smells good idea its much deeper than that
3537330 there is no such thing as suicide when it comes to dogs
3537331 dogs dont try to kill themselves out of depression or pain they rescue themselves from what looks to them like mortal danger during an anxiety attack
3537332 because the main reason why people get rid of their dogs is behavior problems
3537333 medication prevents the dog from hurting itself and i have already treated several cases of dogs who jumped from a balcony or a window because of an anxiety attack that might have been averted
3537334 one dramatic case i recently encountered is an elderly couple a man and his dog the former has not been sleeping for three months because the latter doesnt stop whining breathing heavy and walking from room to room all night long
3537335 a disturbance similar to alzheimers whose clinical manifestation for dogs is a loss of cognitive ability
3537336 the dog can forget where his food bowl is or stop recognizing his owner sometimes he walks and bumps into a wall because he doesnt remember the difference between a wall and a door and if he leaves the house alone he doesnt remember how to return
3537337 you have to remember that it is we who are mainly to blame for the dogs behavior problems
3537338 dogs suffer as a result of these problems and it is not correct to say they dont report them if you know how to listen youll hear its important to remember that not everything we consider abnormal behavior really is abnormal for example barking for a dog that is totally natural behavior an instinct for guarding its territory but then you take them to a fifth floor apartment every five minutes someone passes on the stairwell and the dog barks and the neighbors complain the separation anxiety would not appear either if we didnt lock the dog inside the apartment by itself
3537339 theres a regular group of clients who come for a prescription before israels independence day because of the fireworks many dogs are afraid of noises an important trait for survival which in nature helps the dog escape from situations that endanger him clomicalm is a drug for the medium range between several weeks and three months and is very suitable for situations of anxiety or changes i have a client who moved from a quiet street to a noisy street in tel aviv and her dog became nervous he began to walk around the house and cry and now he takes clomicalm and is completely calm the third type of drug is prozac and similar medications drugs that begin to take effect only after several weeks and are meant for more profound disturbances
3537340 or because they didnt learn to control their dog and the result is that the dog learned to control them
3537341 a well trained dog is one who if you take his bowl away in the middle of eating doesnt utter a sound
3537342 but i have dogs coming to me for treatment who try to bite their owners when they go to feed them i had a woman who was scared to death of her dog which weighed two kilos and didnt let her sit on the sofa i wanted to treat the dog with behavior and drug therapy but they preferred to give it away its a shame because canine aggression against people can be very successfully treated
3537343 i had a dog that literally was afraid of his own shadow and because of that was afraid to leave the house at night when he did go out and suddenly saw his shadow he would become paralyzed and start crying what saved him was prozac after three months of treatment the dog stopped being afraid i also had dogs here who were afraid of stairs or balconies or elevators one of the most common problems is dogs who bark a lot and then the neighbors complain once 30 years ago they would remove the dogs vocal cords imagine the cruelty but today theres a special collar for dogs that releases air every time the dog barks which is a painless way for the dog to learn to stop barking its totally different from the electric collar used by certain dog trainers
3537344 i took him in from the street when he was slightly over four months old hes a mixture of border collie and collie very handsome and smart but time did not erase his traumas and he is riddled with fears of noises fireworks in the winter he gets depressed and a day or two before it rains i get ready last year it reached a point where nobody slept at home the rain would begin and he would start to tremble drool run from side to side he really lost it doron neri treated him with xanax which at first made him listless but afterward we got to the right dosage and he got through the winter much better
3537345 he has always suffered from separation anxiety which expressed itself in the fact that he cant be left alone for even a minute without getting panicky
3537346 we lived at the time in a private house and it bothered us less because he would walk around in the yard and take it apart but at least we could leave the house he was trained for two months at the kennel in kibbutz afikim and returned with the commands they taught him and with a massive cage within a week he had taken apart the front gate of the cage and he took apart within a day the gate of the replacement cage that we bought afterward
3537347 the last pill was something that was supposed to be strong enough to knock out horses and elephants but it didnt affect him
3537348 there was nothing left to destroy in the house and we got used to cleaning up after him every time we return home we decided to put him down four times but we cant bring ourselves to do it we came to the conclusion that we have no choice but to accept the situation and understand that theres no point in buying new things for the house for many years to come
3537349 many people are not willing to make the effort involved in behavior therapy and would prefer to find some miracle drug
3537350 but you have to begin with training and only when the situation is really serious do i recommend combining it with drug therapy for that purpose i send the people to vets
3537351 we once came to see a dog who had jumped from the second floor the owners were not home and the people who found him and called me think that it was because of the noise of fireworks that he heard i had people who came with a bitch who organized getaways for herself from the ground floor window she apparently had become accustomed to the window bars got stuck and hung upside down for hours
3537352 one way is by gradual exposure to noise there are tapes of recorded noises that can be used in combination with sedatives but the most important thing is to pay attention to our own behavior when the dog starts to panic usually people see a panicky dog and try to calm it by petting it but the dog sees the petting as a positive reward which actually causes a reinforcement of its panic reactions sometimes a change in the reaction of the owner is enough to solve the problem
3537353 prozac has the side effect of reducing appetite but it is not used for that purpose there are species like golden retrievers and labradors who come with built in eating disorders they simply ingest everything around them if they arent supervised there are dogs who take it to the extreme and eat even whats inedible plastic and stones for example there are also dogs who experienced hunger in the past and are now trying to make up for what was lacking i had a dog in for treatment who destroyed several things in the house broke objects fled from the house and broke into a supermarket i discovered that the dog was being treated with medications that increase his hunger and that was why he was behaving like that he was simply hungry
3537354 there are dogs that stop eating when theyre sick and there are all kinds of things you can give them in order to arouse their appetite but ive never come across an anorexic dog
3537355 what helped in the end was that i moved in with my partner and she brought with her a small mixed jack russell terrier and that for some reason solved katyas problems
3537356 i was the defending champion i fought hard with the inner self to get rid of the thoughts but it was really hard
3537357 i just finished a movie called finding bliss its a comedy about the adult industry
3537358 the message id really like to get across is that these recurrence rates are actually pretty low and i hope these numbers are reassuring to women because women who are five year survivors of breast cancer often think they are still at high risk for recurrence
3537359 im a little concerned that the data is apples and pineapples
3537360 it just doesnt focus on recurrence rates but includes local recurrence metastatic disease and a new primary breast cancer these are three different things
3537361 telstras turnaround continues to gain momentum on all fronts with our fiscal year guidance met or exceeded for the third consecutive year
3537362 we have redefined our business by investing to create competitive advantages and this value differentiation strategy underpinned by our customer centric transformation sets us apart
3537363 our next g network investment has accelerated mobiles growth delivering double digit growth for the third consecutive half and continuing our stand out performance as customers see the value of our superior mobile offerings
3537364 i had a chance to spend five days with dave two weeks ago and he talks about his kids all the time obviously in the baseball world youre not around your family as much as youd like its a huge sacrifice my thoughts and prayers go out to him and the whole miley family its just a horrible horrible thing
3537365 cody was a very quiet young man and always had a huge smile on his face
3537366 thats the one thing i always said about him he had a big big smile
3537367 he was an all around nice kid and im really going to miss him
3537368 he was really nice and it was hard to get him angry with you about anything
3537369 he was the kind of guy that if you have anything you need advice on you could go up to him and ask his advice
3537370 hed smile and tell you the truth whatever was on his mind hed give you a dollar if you needed a dollar hed give you a shirt if you needed a shirt
3537371 the force unleashed does not support the trophy system on ps3 i cant speculate about what might happen in the future though
3537372 would not be in the best interest of the community
3537373 she was very pleased at the division of paroles decision
3537374 have they done this sort of thing before send an ambassador to answer a question do we ordinarily send people out pro bono to work for us or did his wife send him on a junket
3537375 gina cobb is proof that not all lawyers deserve the death penalty
3537376 in the end the only thing that matters is what you think of yourself
3537377 shove that veiny meaty monster up my tight wet hole and ride me until the break of dawn
3537378 in the end the only thing that matters is what you think of yourself
3537379 hey you wrap that shit up and shove it in my naughty parts
3537380 oh well just because i did it to her doesnt mean ill do it to you youre different blah blah blahhh
3537381 in the end the only thing that matters is what you think of yourself
3537382 in the end the only thing that matters is what you think of yourself
3537383 we have to adapt to the environmental changes that have already taken place or that we can reasonably expect will occur because of climate change
3537384 the city was built with an assumption of an environmental baseline and climate change in many ways changes that baseline
3537385 some of these transformations can potentially be catastrophic as large storms others might be more subtle and difficult to discern over the short term
3537386 he pees up in the air in a big arc so it goes in the coin slot and out the hole where people collect their tickets
3537387 talks will never collapse as long as we have tongues
3537388 i think the bottom line is we lost focus we did and that focus is coming back
3537389 i think fundamentally our service is sound it doesnt mean were perfect and we certainly have work to do things to fix fences to mend
3537390 trying to emphasize that mccain is favored on national security issues
3537391 gee its two months and a few weeks before the us presidential elections seems like a good day to push the russians out of south ossetia probably the us will back us up they dont have much going on elsewhere and likely are bored
3537392 well get you into nato but first you gotta show youre a real nation
3537393 the russians know we want you in nato and with some pressure and us standing in the wings to puff up our chests if necessary they will most likely just order their troops home
3537394 im the one with the experience the knowledge and the judgment
3537395 so perhaps it the electorates focus on bhuttos assassination may serve to enhance those credentials
3537396 six key subjects during her tenure so far contained many promises but she has produced a failing grade on each one
3537397 no one in the democratic party would want to be publicly associated with him
3537398 he was raised as one of us the son of a mill worker he always said
3537399 fighting poverty and providing health care for everybody i hope those are still always his beliefs
3537400 had that not happened i think he would have made an absolutely incredible secretary of labor
3537401 we would have loved to see him play a prominent role in government
3537402 he was the first person since lyndon johnson to address it in a meaningful way
3537403 he was very sincere about wanting to cure the problems
3537404 hes going to have to rebuild his base from the bottom
3537405 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway i mean im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3537406 in the end the only thing that matters is what you think of yourself
3537407 in the end the only thing that matters is what you think of yourself
3537408 in the end the only thing that matters is what you think of yourself
3537409 relationships are all there is everything in the universe only exists because it is in relationship to everything else nothing exists in isolation we have to stop pretending we are individuals that can go it alone
3537410 it is clear that many students are sleepwalking into financial crisis as the credit crunch kicks in and with food and fuel costs set to rise even further we can expect more and more students to get into serious financial difficulty with many having to resort to taking out commercial loans or being bailed out by their parents we also need to overhaul our bursary system
3537411 im sure i will calm down and realise i finished fourth in an olympic final but at the moment its just so painful to look up at that scoreboard and be so close to gold
3537412 it went much better than monday i knew i had to go out much faster and one place i needed to improve was my turn and i think i did that
3537413 the last 15m i dug in and gave it all i had and it just wasnt meant to be i didnt have what it takes this year but maybe in 2012 i will be able to prove i have what it takes
3537414 i didnt realise it was a personal best 59 38sec until i was crawling out of the water but fourth is painful to see
3537415 tumour growth was almost completely abolished in mice treated with these drugs
3537416 despite the introduction of new treatments every year in the uk around 12 500 people will die from breast cancer
3537417 the results of this study are very encouraging and could change the way breast cancer patients are treated the good news is the two treatments used in this study are relatively inexpensive and already used in the clinic
3537418 therefore we should quickly see the benefits of giving women the best possible chance of beating breast cancer
3537419 you look at europe for example switzerland they have their own famous sightseeing trains
3537420 we want to make this into beijings own tourist train
3537421 they may be going to different places they may be travelling in a different part of the plane they may be staying in different hotels but travel and the ability to move around is still a priority in peoples lives
3537422 only a handful of owners have indicated theyre leaving because of financial difficulties
3537423 as tickets are really hard to get the fact that some of the best seats remained untaken through the whole game really upset people who really want to see the game but dont have the ticket
3537424 sponsors may give their tickets to their friends and important customers and they may not appreciate as much and come to the preliminaries
3537425 we are trying to persuade people to respect their rights to watch the games
3537426 this independent report does not reflect conservative party policy and we do not agree with its conclusions we wholeheartedly support the regeneration of northern cities
3537427 many of britains towns and cities have failed and been failed by policy makers for too long
3537428 coastal cities whether large like liverpool and hull or small like scunthorpe and blackpool are most vulnerable they are almost always at the end of the line they have lost their raison detre as ports and it is hard to imagine them prospering at their current sizes
3537429 sunderland demonstrates just how hard it is to regenerate such a city it is time to stop pretending there is a bright future for sunderland and ask ourselves instead what we need to do to offer people in sunderland better prospects
3537430 cities based on highly skilled workers are the most dynamic oxford and cambridge are unambiguously britains leading research universities outside london
3537431 no one is suggesting that residents should be forced to move but we do argue that they should be told the reality of the position
3537432 this report from david camerons favourite thinktank has just dismissed a huge area of the country as worthless is it any wonder there are no tory councillors in liverpool when for all their warm words they have not changed a bit
3537433 as we improve higher and higher each extra gain is that bit more difficult for schools to achieve that doesnt mean i dont think they can achieve that and weve got the right strategies to do so but each of those gains are harder and thats why our targets are particularly ambitious
3537434 its quite hard to step up for a lot of pupils from level four to five because they are having to engage with some of our classical authors writing in a different style of language to what they might use at home with their friends or in school
3537435 we will not comment on speculation about something that might happen some way down the line until sutherland reports nothing is going to happen
3537436 it is vital the cica understands that women are not responsible for mens criminality because they have a drink or for any other reason
3537437 nobody would suggest that if someones wallet was stolen after having a drink then their compensation should be reduced
3537438 as far as we in the government are concerned a victim of rape is not in any way at all culpable due to alcohol consumption
3537439 as i understand it the cica have accepted that the guidelines were being misapplied i hope that the compensation authority will look at these other cases that they believe may also have had the guidelines misinterpreted and review them without the victims themselves having to go back and ask for that review
3537440 if an applicant accepts our decision then that case is finalised and closed
3537441 if they wish to ask for a review they must do this themselves in writing
3537442 contributed to the circumstances which gave rise to the injury
3537443 old prejudices like if a woman is wearing a short skirt or acting in a certain way are still operational
3537444 by reducing compensation because a woman has been drinking the cica is operating under those old prejudices
3537445 the scheme was originally applied wrongly in this case but this was corrected at review and the award was paid in full
3537446 it is not our policy to reduce the level of award to a victim of rape due to alcohol consumption this supports our view that a victim of rape is not in anyway culpable due to alcohol consumption
3537447 a victim of rape should not have any compensation reduced because of their drinking i hope that the compensation authority will look at these other cases
3537448 i dont think they have got another level to go to
3537449 theyve had a lot of players in their team who have hit the peak of their form in the last two years rios been awesome ronaldos been unbelievable i dont think well ever see that again rooney tevez giggs at his age theyve all been fantastic
3537450 we almost won the carling cup almost won the premiership almost won the champions league we were very close but at the end of the day werent good enough
3537451 i never actually realised how good deco was i played against him four or five times but hes probably one of the best ive ever played against and trained with
3537452 i think its unfair to pick one person or one club out because weve all committed it
3537453 i could show you 100 videos of different players and different clubs committing offences weve seen the way we want to go to stop the surrounding of the referees there are now rules last year was there or wasnt there a rule where you couldnt surround the referee i couldnt tell you now theres a rule you cant its the captain who has that responsibility to go and speak to the referee
3537454 mikheil we love you were with you you are a beacon of democracy in the region
3537455 market conditions are obviously challenging and have adversely affected the capital markets division
3537456 we expect difficult market conditions experienced in the first half to continue at least into 2009 but believe collins stewart is well pos itioned to meet the challenges
3537457 the question for republicans in 2008 is whether the politics of a potential shutdown have shifted in their favor
3537458 so will republicans risk facing that charge to force a change in drilling policy and would president bush back them up by refusing to sign a cr that includes a drilling ban were exactly two months from knowing the definitive answers to those questions stay tuned and just to be safe start hoarding candles and canned goods

3537466 but to say im disappointed definitely wouldnt sum up my emotions im absolutely delighted
3537467 i put down a good final run and in an olympic final its the hardest time i have had to do it
3537468 it was a bit nerve wracking waiting but i knew i had done a good run and i just hoped it was a better run than they could put down and it was in some cases but not in martikans he had a great run and well done to him i would have loved the gold but an olympic medal is what i have been looking for and working for the past four years
3537469 this was always the main focus so it doesnt really make up for anything it is just a fantastic result and fantastic reward for 11 years hard work
3537470 we are so delighted for him said his thrilled mother
3537471 he has practiced two sessions a day six days a week every week on top of his studies
3537472 id had a canoe at the side of the house for his entire life and he never even asked what it was doing there but wed turned up at the beach one day in east lothian with his uncle who had two canoes on the roof of the car he and fraser asked their uncle for a shot of the canoe got in the sea and said they really liked it and could they do more

3537475 but we have done a lot of work over the last few years with a psychologist in the past he gave in too easily in the past if he had touched a gate in the first run he wouldnt have come back so strong thats the change that has won him this medal and im delighted for him
3537476 when it happened i cant tell you exactly what went through my mind
3537477 i swore i knew id blown it but i tried really hard in the hope that some of the others coming after me would make mistakes i pushed as hard as i could for the rest of the run i knew it would probably not be enough to get me into the final but i didnt give up
3537478 if i had won a medal here i had hoped there would be all kinds of exciting offers but now i dont know
3537479 if you meet your soulmate why let him get away

3537634 no ha habido despidos por lo que no se entiende que si ya no son necesarios los servicios de casi 500 trabajadores en salamanca s lo sean los que hacen el mismo trabajo en jerez y como aqu no se conocen las condiciones del contrato y en su caso la rescisi n de la que informaron el pasado viernes no se puede alegar nada m s que lo que ya se sabe
3537635 its baseball youre going to hit a spot when the bats are just going to go dead for some time and when that happens you just have to battle through it and hope to pick it up as soon as you can
3537636 im never going to say never because never is the wrong time but yeah i think you tinker if i feel that it gets to a certain point where we need to do that
3537637 but i think that you need to show confidence in the players you have weve played 119 games and these guys have put up pretty good numbers so lets stay with it for a little bit
3537638 the knee jerk reaction is never a good one but im not going to say that im not going to change it
3537639 i think its just a matter of what were going through right now
3537640 i think our guys are talented guys in that offense and i think well get it going
3537641 fire eagle is a way for people to take their location to the web
3537642 essentially fire eagle is nothing more nothing less than a store for a users location
3537643 whats more interesting is how it works as a switchboard
3537644 fire eagle solved all the hard problems with location for us
3537645 it makes it easier for bloggers to have correct location information on their blog within their posts being able to geo tag their content
3537646 obviously fire eagle is crucial to the success of what were trying to do
3537647 there are other tools that identify location but none that do it in specifically this way
3537648 the attention to privacy is noteworthy as is the concept behind fire eagle the challenge will be to build user awareness and adoption in the near term
3537649 nada de eso es importante lo que hay que recordar de kirchner es su presidencia
3537650 a mi me parece que todos debemos ser en determinadas circunstancias pacientes y cautos m xime cuando tenemos responsabilidades pol ticas
3537651 no puedo contestar eso tambi n tengo mi modo de pensar sobre esto
3537652 este es el preciso instante en que digo no voy a hacer declaraciones sobre el punto
3537653 tambi n digo que hay que moverse con cuidado porque la pol tica tiene muchos aspectos miserables
3537654 uno de esos aspectos m s miserables es tratar de potenciar la debilidad del otro tratando de llevar agua para el molino descuidando los efectos negativos para el conjunto
3537655 los precios en la argentina se mueven se mueven desde hace un tiempo como producto de que la econom a crece el consumo se mantiene se mueve tambi n como producto de que los precios internacionales se empiezan a tirar para arriba los precios internos
3537656 este fen meno que algunos llaman agflaci n que es el fen meno derivado de la suba de los alimentos ocurre en todo el mundo
3537657 est en discusi n si lo que dice el indec es cierto
3537658 asombroso escuchar a algunos decir que tenemos una inflaci n del 30 o del 35 por ciento mensual
3537659 tengo la ntima convicci n de no haber cometido delito alguno en toda mi vida
3537660 we do not yet have a peace deal we have a provisional cessation of hostilities but this is significant progress
3537661 the difference between lunatics and other people is that when they smell blood it is very difficult to stop them
3537662 we will be forced to take other measures to prevent any repetition of the situation that emerged because of the outrageous georgian aggression
3537663 plain and simple blatant aggression on the part of russia
3537664 they shot their brother russian peacekeepers then they finished them off with bayonets so we are not going to see them there any more
3537665 there are a few things that need to be discussed to get a full ceasefire
3537666 the russians are saying that they will never again accept georgians in any form in south ossetia they see them as a trojan horse that started the attacks last week
3537667 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
3537668 abkhazia and ossetia if i mention territorial integrity are to the best of my knowledge part of georgia
3537669 nato is not seeking a direct role or a military role in this conflict
3537670 require the signing of a legally binding treaty on the non use of force
3537671 why are people waving flags its not as if we won
3537672 i wonder why he did it he has only 10 000 soldiers and he takes on russia
3537673 we dont at this stage see how the two can work so closely together
3537674 from a future strategy point of view of the port of hobart we feel that its going to be blocked off from any future expansion and in fact it will reduce its capability to be an operational port
3537675 as we improve higher and higher each extra gain is that bit more difficult for schools to achieve that doesnt mean i dont think they can achieve that and weve got the right strategies to do so but each of those gains are harder and thats why our targets are particularly ambitious
3537676 its quite hard to step up for a lot of pupils from level four to five because they are having to engage with some of our classical authors writing in a different style of language to what they might use at home with their friends or in school
3537677 we will not comment on speculation about something that might happen some way down the line until sutherland reports nothing is going to happen
3537678 pelosi is committed to her global warming fanaticism to the point where she has said that shes just trying to save the planet we all know that someone did that over 2 000 years ago they saved the planet we didnt need nancy pelosi to do that
3537679 interromper o suas fun es e o presidente designar o governador que exercer fun es at que um novo seja escolhido como resultado do processo eleitoral correspondente
3537680 we hope that it was just the beginning of a continuing dialogue as we move toward a final rfp that prescribes the right aircraft and gives appropriate weight to all of the capabilities that will be required for the evolving mission over the next several decades
3537681 boeing remains committed to providing the air force with a next generation tanker that meets real world mission requirements and that is selected through a fair open and unbiased competition that follows a realistic timetable
3537682 while this helps us understand the root causes it doesnt change the fundamental problem that we are as a nation less active than we should be
3537683 all children regardless of their natural abilities should be given adequate encouragement and support to be physically active at school and at home
3537684 atirar deputado aos le es n o saciar os porcos

3537697 hello i want to make your parents my in laws
3537698 oh yeah i am sooo into philosophy and that kinda shit

3537728 n o sei o que vai acontecer agora a gente n o tem para onde ir
3537729 why was he loved so much by some and hated so much by others
3537730 recall when abrahams lord allah tested him with commands that he fulfilled
3537731 surely i am going to make you a leader prophet of mankind
3537732 my covenant prophethood etc does not include wrong doers thalimun
3537733 and recall when allah made the house kabah in bakkah which later was called
3537734 and when abraham said my lord make this city makkah a place of security and provide its people with fruits for them that believe in allah almighty and the last day
3537735 as for him who doesnt believe i shall leave him in contentment for a while then i shall compel him t the torment of the fire and worst indeed is that destination
3537736 and when abraham and ishmael were raising the foundations of the sacred house kabah in makkah saying our lord
3537737 our lord send amongst them a messenger of their own and indeed allah answered by sending muhammad peace be upon him who shall recite unto them your verses and instruct them in the book this quran and full knowledge of allahs laws and jurisprudence and sanctify them verily you are the all mighty the all wise
3537738 men are the protectors and maintainers of women because allah has made one of them to excel the other and because they spend to support the women from their means therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient to allah and to their husbands and guard in the husbands absence what allah orders them to guard e g their chastity their husbands property etc as to those women on whose part you see ill conduct admonish them refuse to share their beds startle them set forth a clear example or parable for them to make clear the point of what is going on before divorcing them so if they return to proper obedience to allah and their husbands do not annoy them any further surely allah is ever most high most great
3537739 o you believers intoxicating drinks gambling fortune telling etc is the hated work of the devil so stay away from all of that horrible stuff that you will be successful
3537740 i can safely say that yu suzuki is in fact still a sega employee
3537741 o ministro gilmar mendes tomou como ato pessoal o que n o era ela me ligou para perguntar se eu tinha decretado a pris o preventiva
3537742 como o ministro estaria irado talvez ela tenha ligado para compreender e passar para o ministro talvez a justificativa foi nobre
3537743 a colabora o espor dica remunerada ou n o em assuntos de sua especialidade e devidamente autorizada pelo diretor geral da abin
3537744 o perigo a abin atuando como pol cia pol tica com esse texto a abin passa a ser pol cia pol tica nos moldes do que foi o sni servi o nacional de informa es que funcionou no regime militar e a gestapo pol cia pol tica de adolf hitler na alemanha
3537745 como negociador eu me sinto como se estivesse correndo uma maratona e ainda n o se definiu qual o percurso deram a partida e voc sai correndo agora voc n o sabe onde est a linha de chegada

3537747 esse o objetivo dessas conversas ver quais as respostas para ver se vale a pena fazer mais um esfor o nas pr ximas semanas
3537748 essas conversas que o presidente luiz in cio lula da silva tem mantido s o essenciais porque se n o houver entendimento nas mais altas inst ncias que a rodada deve ser perseguida essa vis o n o vai permear at os negociadores
3537749 problemas pol ticos impediram um acordo naquele momento sobre aquele tema a minha impress o era de que se tivesse mais quatro ou cinco dias em genebra resolver amos este problema
3537750 tem a sensa o de que ainda h uma pequena chance de concluir essas negocia es
3537751 we are receiving reports that a policy of ethnic cleansing was being conducted in villages in south ossetia the number of refugees is climbing the panic is growing people are trying to save their lives
3537752 america and europes actions on kosovo left russia feeling threatened encircled and more convinced that it had to take aggressive measures to restore its power dignity and influence in a region it considers its strategic backyard
3537753 russia cannot allow georgia to solve the south ossetia problem by military means
3537754 of course the deaths of russian peacekeepers and the destruction caused by the invading georgians is an important reason why medvedev has ordered russian forces to intervene in the conflict but there are bigger strategic reasons behind that moscow cannot let saakashvili succeed in his gamble
3537755 we must make clear that nato welcomes the membership aspirations of georgia and ukraine and offers them a clear path forward towards that goal my countrys position is clear nato should welcome georgia and ukraine into the membership action plans
3537756 though nato does not want to show it truly sides with saakashvili at the latest summit the president got a permit to start a military operation
3537757 the things that were happening in kosovo the things that were happening in iraq we are now following the same path the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america south ossetian defense officials used to make statements about imminent aggression from georgia but the latter denied everything whereas the us department of state reloaded not comments on the matter in essence they have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals they are responsible for this the world community will learn about it
3537758 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
3537759 we underscore the international communitys support for georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders
3537760 we have made it clear to the russians that if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on us russian relations
3537761 there is no possibility of drawing nato or the international community into this
3537762 for the bush administration the choice now becomes whether backing georgia which more than any other former soviet republic has allied with the united states on the south ossetia issue is worth alienating russia at a time when getting russias help to rein in irans nuclear ambitions is at the top of the united states foreign policy agenda
3537763 were really talking about taking a look with a very different lens
3537764 como negociador eu me sinto como se estivesse correndo uma maratona e ainda n o se definiu qual o percurso deram a partida e voc sai correndo agora voc n o sabe onde est a linha de chegada
3537765 a rodada de doha s morre quando o maratonista decidir sentar do lado da estrada e disser entreguei os pontos enquanto estiver correndo tenho esperan a que o sinal de chegada apare a

3537770 windows server 2008 hyper v is an excellent option for corporations looking to save power and space ease provisioning efforts and achieve full hardware utilization through virtualization weve been an innovative early adopter worked closely with microsofts developers since the advent of windows nt and were pleased to do so as well with hyper v
3537771 after independent testing we found that diskeepers automatic defragmenter not only exploits windows server 2008 hyper v capabilities but also is designed to meet mission critical expectations in a virtualized environment

3537776 cvs has always wanted to be in good markets that grow and if you look at population centers of the united states were in most of them this directly addresses the central and northern california markets and gives us access to those consumers
3537777 these are highly attractive regions of the country where we are not currently represented
3537778 and they are very difficult real estate markets to penetrate
3537779 given our changing industry landscape we believe this combination is the logical step for our company
3537780 two weeks for every year is as bad as its going to get

3537784 untuk kali ini permintaannya tidak terlalu banyak berbeda dengan bulan puasa tahun lalu yang pergi umrah cukup banyak
3537785 tahun ini yang berangkat umrah berkurang mulai agustus hingga ramadan hanya 20 orang yang berangkat biasanya kita memberangkatkan sampai 100 orang per bulan
3537786 naiknya harga paket umrah dipicu oleh banyak hal seperti harga avtur bahan bakar pesawat yang naik terus sejak bulan juni mengakibatkan harga tiket pesawat juga naik
3537787 hotel bintang empat tarifnya jadi hotel bintang lima hotel bintang tiga jadi seperti hotel bintang empat akibatnya harga paket umrah naik cukup tinggi
3537788 biro perjalanan jadi bingung menjualnya karena harganya terus berubah setiap bulan

3537799 the visit is the latest in a eries of moves by arab states that iraqi and u s officials say could improve security and counter the influence of shiite led iran a player here in economic diplomatic and security matters
3537800 iraq had planned to give the monarch a state welcome but instead the king arrived and left with no fanfare the announcement of his visit came as he boarded a plane to leave iraq
3537801 u s officials had been urging king abdullah to visit iraq to bolster ties between the two countries as part of washingtons campaign to shore up support for the iraqi government as a counterweight to iranian influence
3537802 jordan hosts about 500 000 iraqi refugees who have fled violence in their war torn country and amman has estimated the costs of sheltering them so far at more than 1 3 billion euros 2 billion

3537806 a multi national force west marine was killed when his unit was attacked by an enemy force in anbar province aug 10
3537807 the clinton camp is quite happy with the platforms including of language to the effect that clinton placed 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling an allusion to her winning 18 million votes during the primaries
3537808 because a large chunk of clintons 18 million supporters are upset that the obama campaign has not been more gracious toward senator clinton and has done little to reach out to her former supporters
3537809 more evidence of a candidate faux pas o force one as cbs allison okeefe describes obamas campaign plane contains a luxurious section for the candidate more reminiscent of an airborne corporate executive suite than a presidential candidate who has to appeal to working class american voters
3537810 he should be in myrtle beach and you know if hes going to take a vacation at this time and i just think this is not the time to do that

3537817 particularly during the sars epidemic xinhua has for last few months been putting out news reports embarrassing to the government but they are designed to fool the international community since they are not published in chinese
3537818 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
3537819 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3537820 lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in terms of voice yang peiyi is perfect each member of our team agreed
3537821 its something akin to martial law in that particular area
3537822 it got to the point where somebody was going to get seriously hurt or killed if we didnt do something
3537823 a growing world needs more energy but at the same time we need to find new ways of managing carbon emissions to limit climate change continued investment in technology is one of the key ways we are able to address this challenge and continue to secure a profitable and sustainable future

3537827 there are no implications for human health regarding the khv disease and it only affects fish of the carp variety
3537828 all it means is that we are not allowed to move the fish from the top pond but we hadnt planned on doing that anyway
3537829 the problem is that people dont really know how it starts but once it does it can kill all of your fish really quickly
3537830 there are symptoms but even if a fish isnt showing symptoms it can carry the disease for years without being detected because of that risk when one of your fish becomes infected you really have to kill them all disinfect your pond and start again
3537831 the worst thing would be if defra put restrictions on importing because koi enthusiasts rely on being able to bring fish in from japan
3537832 we were looking at what we can do in this franchise to move forward
3537833 imagine se os milh es de cubanos exilados em miami ficassem lamentando os milhares que fidel castro matou

3537836 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3537837 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3537838 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3537839 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3537840 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3537841 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3537842 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3537843 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3537844 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3537845 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3537846 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3537847 who are open to doing something on the production side
3537848 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3537849 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3537850 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3537851 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3537852 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3537853 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3537854 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3537855 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3537856 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3537857 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3537858 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3537859 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3537860 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3537861 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3537862 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3537863 having lived in meno falls richfield amp germantown gives me a breadth of experience the other candidates do not offer
3537864 being a small business owner and elected official provides me with the experience to understand and promote the district residents concerns and point of view issues
3537865 entre sus amiguitos se encontraba un tal xxxxx que muri a os despu s en su casa de

3537870 el presidente va a formar un gobierno de unidad nacional que incluir a miembros de la oposici n
3537871 el presidente ha dicho que las conversaciones no han fracasado
3537872 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3537873 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3537874 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3537875 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3537876 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3537877 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3537878 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3537879 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3537880 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3537881 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3537882 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3537883 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3537884 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3537885 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3537886 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3537887 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3537888 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3537889 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3537890 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3537891 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3537892 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3537893 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3537894 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3537895 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3537896 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3537897 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3537898 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3537899 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3537900 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3537901 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3537902 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3537903 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3537904 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3537905 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3537906 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3537907 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3537908 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3537909 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3537910 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3537911 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3537912 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3537913 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3537914 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3537915 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3537916 washington y la oligarqua triunfan en bolivia referendo ratifica desmembramiento del pas
3537917 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3537918 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3537919 i think this really is a pretty clear indication rather than it being climate change causing the rapid extinction of the tasmanian mega fauna which was the current orthodoxy
3537920 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3537921 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3537922 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3537923 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3537924 hay empresas como polar que hacen productos con otros componentes para evadir los precios regulados por eso ahora le vamos a exigir que esos nuevos rubros se vendan al precio que estableci el gobierno nacional
3537925 el producto es el mismo igual es aceite y est regulado
3537926 las empresas que produzcan los alimentos enriquecidos fortificados o con otros componentes tienen que tener previamente la permisolog a del ministerio de industrias ligeras y comercios si el ente no autoriza esos permisos no podr n distribuir los productos
3537927 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3537928 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3537929 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3537930 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3537931 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3537932 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3537933 they upgraded their 2009 outlook which i think will be taken positively
3537934 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3537935 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year

3537937 is perfectly natural for putin medvedev is used to playing the good cop
3537938 shook the hands of soldiers met the refugees and told the world what russia would do he was the man of action in the eyes of russian voters
3537939 medvedev declared a humanitarian catastrophe was not a good thing
3537940 the crisis made it clear who was in charge if anyone had any illusions earlier
3537941 putin acted as the one taking the crucial decisions he explained to the nation the legal basis of russias intervention in georgia it was putin who first used the word genocide which was later echoed by medvedev
3537942 it is particularly important that putin was the first to make a public statement he became the first newsmaker
3537943 que se inscriban todos los precandidatos y no habr unidad as seguir yo rinando
3537944 just coming and taking the plants away from them has some impact but its really not the end goal here were about trying to put the leadership behind bars and federally prosecute those folks

3537947 como si en el este de alemania no hubieran pasado medio siglo sufriendo la obra de marx
3537948 i support the principle of lowering prices but i think the plan will punish the smaller independent retailers
3537949 this kind of thing is ludicrous that such errors could be permitted to occur and not have controls in place to prevent them occurring
3537950 while we dont want to go off the deep end about a single error the fact is corporations arent being careful enough with consumer data and are not being held to account
3537951 do i have my wallet money house keys drivers license
3537952 it is a mission where anything less than perfection is not acceptable and that is the standard
3537953 that certainly is the standard of the folks that brought that to us through the years and we will return to that standard
3537954 what i can promise you is that were taking a comprehensive look at this issue so this is not onesies and twosies and a handful of fixes
3537955 es ist eine vereinbarung von grunds tzen und ich denke wir haben eine volle bereinstimmung von grunds tzen

3537965 we are thrilled to give back to this local charity we have moved our home and family here to gulf shores and are happy to make a donation to a charity that changes the lives of so many troubled teens and their families
3537966 the ryder cup is in the back of my mind the way paul set it up if i win one or two events i could make the team thats who he wants a guy who is hot and hopefully im one of those guys
3537967 obviously if i play well ill get in if i make the cut and finish in the middle of the pack i should make it
3537968 it reduced the economic incentive payable to end user commercial and industrial or c amp i customers
3537969 applied materials delivered financial and operational performance that was in line with our quarter forecast during a difficult semiconductor industry environment
3537970 we made significant progress in our solar division during the quarter
3537971 substantially increasing the number of crystalline silicon systems shipped and enabling start up production on the first four sunfab thin film lines at customer sites
3537972 fiscal q3 was the trough in semiconductor orders and revenue
3537973 in the current environment there is uncertainty around the timing of those investments
3537974 i think the bottom line is we lost focus we did and that focus is coming back
3537975 i think fundamentally our service is sound it doesnt mean were perfect and we certainly have work to do things to fix fences to mend
3537976 we have taken a decision georgia is quitting the cis
3537977 i think its very simple weve been devastated by injuries no team ive ever seen in baseball has been decimated like this it would kill any team
3537978 imagine the red sox without josh beckett and jon lester pitching is 70 percent of the game wang won 19 games two straight years chamberlain became the most dominating pitcher in baseball you cant lose two guys like that
3537979 its not making excuses its reality thats part of the game thats clearly our problem
3537980 this is just another way hes making history and we want to be part of it
3537981 i was so nervous i dont know if i saw it really well but i think its a good likeness
3537982 they showed them yesterday and i looked at them online i was planning to buy them but never dreamed we would do this
3537983 presley place where the money will go we contribute to them every year
3537984 also i want that on display in my living room in a curio cabinet
3537985 the goal of this pilot program will be to study the benefits that item level rfid provides in the areas of enhanced productivity customer service and inventory accuracy the team of companies with whom jones is partnering on this initiative consists of
3537986 auto id sensor networks provide rfid systems with the ability to manage data collected from a networks edge
3537987 with new crops coming in prices have stabilized on an international level
3537988 despite junes severe flooding in the midwest u s farmers are on pace to produce the second largest corn crop and fourth largest soybean crop in history
3537989 we expect the peak in food inflation to be reached in july
3537990 starting from august we will see the recent decline in soft commodity prices to start feeding through into lower food inflation
3537991 please help us shrink the supply of oil and block refinery and nuclear plant construction so that the price of gasoline and power will be so expensive well have to live like our great grandparents without cars modern electric powered appliances airplanes and without the things made in factories and raised on modern farms
3537992 im trying to save the planet im trying to save the planet
3537993 there just wasnt really interest in pushing it and testing the 5 level
3537994 im not ready to say for sure that the bottom is in but its becoming more difficult to press this market lower
3537995 traders are also starting to look ahead to whether we need to have a little bit of a risk premium in the market going into the growing season whether we can close this out before we have a frost or not
3537996 the course has been set and theyre making very good money
3537997 the entire u s will go to a 10 blend
3537998 and i wanted to see if we could make this dream a reality
3537999 the future of our herd will be built on these donor cows
3538000 but we believe in continuous improvement and we hope that the heifers were producing today will be better than the cows we started with we have about 160 heifers out of our first calf crop that we are calving out now some of those will probably become donor cows in the future
3538001 i want cattle with high dollar beef b high dollar weaned w low birth weights and as much yearling weight that i can get into a moderate framed cow
3538002 but that doesnt mean weve lost sight of producing cattle with a good functional look to them our cows must have good udder quality they must be good females im not into breeding terminal cross cattle
3538003 in my opinion herd health is going to be a very important part of the future of the cattle business
3538004 we could see that it was becoming increasingly important and we wanted to be ahead of the industry when it came to testing for disease and ensuring it doesnt get spread to our customers herds
3538005 our entire cow herd including the recipient cows were tested for these disease in the fall of 2007 and well continue to retest those cows on an annual basis
3538006 all of our calves are tested for bvd and the ones that are retained in the herd will have an ongoing program of testing for brucellosis and johnes
3538007 joe is trying to produce seedstock with credibility and value so hes unusually committed to this herd health testing program
3538008 the great thing about his program is that his customers have assurance that if they buy something from him theyre buying cattle that will be as good as anything in the nation from a health standpoint
3538009 its pretty rare to find anyone whos done as much herd health testing as joe has done
3538010 it played a big part in our decision to buy bulls from him
3538011 prospects for improved oil market fundamentals over the next 18 months point to an easing in the market balance and price weakness over the near term
3538012 downward price pressures would increase if the economic slowdown proves deeper or longer than expected and if higher prices lead to lower consumption and lower demand for opec crude than currently anticipated
3538013 gasoline prices are expected to continue falling slowly averaging just less than 3 80 per gallon over the next few months
3538014 this forecast reflects continuing weak gasoline margins because of the decline in gasoline consumption and growth in ethanol supply
3538015 these higher prices reflect strength in diesel demand particularly in emerging markets which has significantly increased the margins between diesel prices and crude oil costs from those of last year
3538016 hardware o que a gente chuta e software o que a gente xinga
3538017 we appreciate usda making these clarifications in favor of cattle producers which allows producers to use affidavits when they are buying and selling cattle and to allow the use of affidavits to provide origin information to packers
3538018 with a team of developers from multiple companies around the world contributing weve continued to make the imedia browser even more useful than ever
3538019 we continue to receive comments from mac users who appreciate the ability to quickly access their media libraries using the imedia browser as a standalone application or as an embedded part of their favorite applications
3538020 previous versions of fotomagico used their own proprietary version of ilife integration keeping up with all the changes used to be a lot of work this has gotten much easier since we migrated to karelias imedia framework since its open source and a lot of developers are contributing to it it gets updated quickly when the media repositories change

3538023 we had a big break in the market but still thats big
3538024 the updated name and numbering system is unique to john deere and allows for a more consistent approach to naming our equipment around the world
3538025 this new system allows customers to more quickly and easily identify the engine horsepower of a tractor its capability and its size by looking at the hood decal
3538026 letters at the beginning of the alphabet indicate a tractor model has lower levels of capabilities when compared to other models in its family letters higher in the alphabet specify a tractor has more advanced capabilities some tractors will also have a sixth position to designate a specific configuration such as a high crop or narrow profile tractor or to show that it has tracks
3538027 our dealers will refer to them as the five d series five e series and 5m series of tractors within the series theyll refer to a specific model as a five zero sixty five e tractor larger models such as the new 6115d would be referred to as a six one hundred fifteen d
3538028 we learned a great cost of the price of allowing aggression against free nations to go unchecked with our allies we must stand in united purpose to persuade russian government to withdraw its troops from georgia

3538031 based on conditions as of aug 1 yields are expected to average 155 bushels per acre up 3 9 bushels from last year if realized this yield would be the second highest on record behind 2004
3538032 everybody compared this year to 1993 and the floods we had then but we need to step back and remember that 15 years ago we didnt have pattern tiling of cropland like we do today
3538033 granted those acres were underwater at one point but the water ran off and farmers were able to get in and reseed them
3538034 feed and residual use for wheat is projected 35 million bushels lower than july as increased supplies of feed grains and sharply lower projected feed grain prices reduce prospects for domestic wheat feeding
3538035 the nations corn crop improved 1 point in the ratings last week and now stands at 67 good excellent
3538036 this is highly contra seasonal as the crop normally deteriorates at this point of the growing season in fact this is the first time in 10 years corn ratings have improved between the first and second week of august
3538037 looking at crop progress data released on monday afternoon one has to come to the same conclusion that we have had for several weeks the crops are very late
3538038 it takes about five weeks for corn to go from the dough stage to black layer when it is safe from frost so 70 of the nations corn crop will still be susceptible to frost damage on september 14
3538039 we had problems with frost damage to the crop in 1993 and 1995 but crops in 1990 and 1992 were able to make it without frost losses
3538040 were trying to get an assessment of what exactly it means what a halt means and whether its taking place
3538041 it now appears that an effort may be underway to depose georgias duly elected government
3538042 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people
3538043 i dont think im going to get in the position of blame im not going to get in the position of trying to be a fact witness of the events of august 6 and august 7 and i think its actually an irrelevant question
3538044 reviewing our options for doing more once the shooting stops and we can hopefully get groups in there and get resources and assets in there
3538045 monetary officials can for the first time in a very long while breathe a collective sigh of deflationary relief
3538046 deflation risk is making its way into the markets vocabulary after the apparent inflation bubble has been dealt a possibly mortal wound by the caving commodities sector
3538047 core inflation is rising as well but much more slowly
3538048 and with global agricultural prices stabilizing in the near term overall inflation should begin to subside by end year
3538049 it seems that the fever that hit raw materials markets has calmed down which should show on retail prices by the end of the year
3538050 the inflation peak has been reached in june consumer prices should now decelerate quite sharply but should stay above the 3 0 threshold until the end of summer
3538051 inflation should be driven down by favourable base effects thereafter and reach the 2 0 line next spring
3538052 i am shocked shocked that birmingham has beaten us to the punch i plan to attend their camp and if i like it perhaps i shall try to crank this one up
3538053 con la llegada de un nuevo gobierno y una nueva ministra se est replanteando la cuesti n de los trasvases lo que no nos parece mal
3538054 con cuestiones como el trasvase de aguas de extremadura mientras los aspectos importantes quedan por resolver
3538055 se garantice el trasvase tajo segura al contrario de lo que afirma el estatuto de castilla la mancha
3538056 una vez exista esta garant a no nos parece mal que se complemente con el trasvase del tajo medio
3538057 pero que no nos entretengan con el tajo medio mientras se aprueba un estatuto que cuestiona un trasvase el tajo segura fundamental para el abastecimiento de la provincia de alicante

3538064 sin apenas margen para que los alumnos al comienzo de las clases inicien con normalidad el curso escolar
3538065 pese a estar en verano llueve sobre mojado y la consejer a de educaci n como todos los cursos incurre en su proverbial falta de planificaci n al adjudicar las obras de acondicionamiento y reformas de los centros educativos sin apenas margen para que los alumnos al comienzo de las clases inicien con normalidad el curso escolar
3538066 con el consiguiente peligro que este hecho conlleva y las l gicas molestias que este tipo de situaciones comportan
3538067 adjudica las mejoras de los colegios en la segunda quincena de julio sin tiempo material para que finalicen en la fecha oficial del inicio de curso comienzos de septiembre
3538068 curso tras curso se va de vacaciones sin prever las caracter sticas de su departamento

3538074 six weeks ago events in georgia would have pushed prices to 160 or higher
3538075 now largely because of a stronger u s dollar we are seeing investors liquidating long oil positions that they purchased with the intention of holding
3538076 lo que qued en claro es que el ministro les dijo que presentaran un plan integral y a partir de lo que traigan se ver cu l es la respuesta

3538081 conservatives suggested witnesses need not attend committee says tory agent
3538082 the rationale of the power to punish contempts whether contempt of court or contempt of the houses is that the courts and the two houses should be able to protect themselves from acts which directly or indirectly impede them in the performance of their functions
3538083 we never take for granted the commitment weve made to running an email service that you can count on we heard loud and clear today how much people care about their gmail accounts
3538084 we are acknowledging the more difficult trading conditions as we head into the second half
3538085 we still have a very strong pipeline of rooms we signed more deals in the us in the first six months of 2008 than we did in the same period last year and that was before the credit crunch
3538086 does not expect to see any improvement in the adverse economic and financial market trends that affected this quarters results
3538087 it will continue its programme to reduce personnel levels costs and risk concentrations
3538088 the integrated business model which we created almost nine years ago didnt work so we have come up with a new strategy
3538089 we have got three businesses that are profitable and one that isnt capital markets is loss making because it hasnt got much in by way of revenues because the capital markets are shut we have to accept that this is a hugely cyclical business and when it disappears it disappears completely
3538090 if we get to a point where vendors are prepared to say a price that institutions believe is attractive markets could open again
3538091 im quite pessimistic but we are running the business so it can survive and prosper it is still profitable its cash generative and there is a lot of cash on the balance sheet
3538092 this is the worst financial crisis that anyone alive has seen
3538093 the opportunities are there but there is a certain nervousness among corporates to stick their heads above the parapet
3538094 we believe that standard chartered needs to strengthen its equity tier 1 ratio from the current level of 6 1 per cent which puts it close to the bottom versus 70 asian banks under coverage
3538095 the continued dominance of wholesale versus consumer banking profits is set to reduce overall returns for the group with pressures on the groups capital likely to necessitate a sharp slowdown in asset growth or the need to raise equity at some stage
3538096 will not go down at all well at the bank of england
3538097 worryingly core inflation spiked up to 1 9 per cent in july from 1 6 per cent in june which raises concern that higher energy and food prices are increasingly having second round inflationary effects
3538098 the background is that indian law precludes foreign direct investment in multi brand retail although international retailers have been striking franchise and partnership agreements with local retailers and industrial conglomerates to allow entry to what is expected to be a large and fast growing market over the coming years
3538099 weakening consumer spending will likely hurt all ad categories in 2008 we think 2009 may be just as bad if not worse
3538100 relative upside at the other end of this tunnel with regional newspapers retaining local higher priced advertising
3538101 our view is that micro focus is very well attuned to the current economic climate anticipating that the market and operational commentary should remain positive we retain our buy
3538102 if and when it changes we will have a wholesale business and our association with tata will give us great experience in india
3538103 we view this as a sensible deal for tesco with a strong partner in tata which has existing retail capability and strong local knowledge of the indian market whilst it will enable tesco to begin the development infrastructure and supply chain which is one of the current constraints of the indian market to modern retail practices
3538104 people will judge us not by what we say but what we do
3538105 we never take for granted the commitment weve made to running an email service that you can count on we heard loud and clear today how much people care about their gmail accounts
3538106 the concern is that winter fuels bills could have as big or a bigger impact

3538109 for the average alaskan who drives to work and picks their kids up from school these
3538110 there is an increase in targeted attacks on specific pieces of high value information whether that is directors of companies and their personal pension investments or attacking corporate networks to try to take intellectual property ip out of the organisation and move it to the developing world
3538111 the computer in aunt ethels back bedroom may be right now playing a role in a cyber warfare campaign
3538112 we dont know for certain it is russia attacking georgia and vice versa or if the attacks are sanctioned by the military but there is clearly disruption taking place as the governments take pot shots at each other
3538113 the shadow economy is very similar to the real world economy
3538114 specialisation drives competition and high quality goods and all the things that make the real world economy tick
3538115 the shadow economy is much freer than ours and therefore price is regulated by supply and demand alone
3538116 these are the scariest problems because they are very difficult to notice and can go undetected for years
3538117 it was difficult to tell who paid for the attack but the type of information stolen suggests it would have been worth hundreds of thousands of dollars
3538118 no individual would be interested in that kind of data because they couldnt do anything with it
3538119 it was a long time ago and i was never near this standard
3538120 we had a canoe at the side of our house for all his life
3538121 and when he was 14 he was down at the beach one day with his uncle and he said oh can we have a go on these so he and his brother went out in them came back and said we really like canoeing hed never thought to ask why we had a canoe at the side of the house for 14 years
3538122 when he decides to do something he works hard at it
3538123 he feels the need to do something mental to balance out all his training
3538124 on the astronaut application form there was a box saying

3538128 thanks to a conservative dividend payout policy and investment opportunities in waste the yield on the stock is low relative to peers at 3 3 per cent on a one year forward basis we see scope for the payout to be rebased upwards by about 15 per cent at the next price review
3538129 the rating on the stock reflects perceptions of greater cyclicality than appears to be the case and the weakness of the small mid cap sector we believe the shares offer significant upside potential given the low rating high roce leading market positions and growth outlook
3538130 remind s one of the bulwarks of some condemned old craft

3538132 i made up my mind that if it so turned out that we should sleep together he must undress and get into bed before i did

3538135 the large slow moving shadows in the north western namibia desert belong to desert dwelling elephants the smaller fast moving shadows belong to the vehicles of the humans hunting them six trophy permits have been issued for the desert dwelling elephants an endangered species by namibias ministry of environment and tourism met some time in the next few days when the smaller shadows catch up with the larger shadows phone calls will be made to countries like the us germany or spain foreigners will board overnight planes with their rifles tucked under their arms a few hours later they will return home carrying fibre glass moulds of elephant heads to be mounted on walls and admired by dinner guests
3538136 fall fashions are showing much longer hemlines this year and were seeing much more demand for more feminine hairstyles as well
3538137 tone on tone a softer dimensional color that doesnt have as strong a line of demarcation
3538138 the objective is to achieve a style that doesnt require frequent touch ups which allows one to go longer between appointments
3538139 bangs have taken a back seat recently but theyre on the fashion runway big time this fall
3538140 more of a softer flirty look that offers options in styling they can be worn down swept to the side or blended when worn back
3538141 when the economy goes down everyone in fashion knows that lipstick sales go up
3538142 the children and staff get a lot out of the interaction with the story and others involved
3538143 it is always more fun when there are more kids to read to and practice art and craft with
3538144 we have had little incidence in the past and if unearthing the rubbish has caused concern to the public we will cover the hole back up and find another section of the site to bury the asbestos
3538145 still even with the huge distance we are travelling you just have to grin and bear it
3538146 the teams then put in for their own fuel and expenses so that any money that has been donated goes directly to variety and the children
3538147 its a lot of fun and each year we plan a route that takes us through regional towns that may be doing it tough from the drought or natural disaster
3538148 once the route is planned we look to organisations in the town that might need funds and might organise a barbeque lunch or dinner put on by a school p amp c for all the bashers
3538149 they might make 5000 or more towards their own fundraising efforts and we get a good feed not to mention that the aforementioned b double carries supplies and giveaways of toys for the kids we meet along the way
3538150 its also good for the towns in general with almost 500 bashers descending on them we all spend at least 150 a day which translates to 70 000 or more injected into regional economies
3538151 i am very glad to be able to visit young in support of small business and turn my hand at a bit of gift selling
3538152 it is perhaps a little ironic being back in young working in a gift store of all things considering our previous time here but it is very interesting to get back into it if only for a few hours
3538153 small business is the life blood of all communities of all sizes throughout australia
3538154 not one single individual community throughout the country would be able to survive without the contribution that small business makes
3538155 small business employs more people throughout the country than any other group not to mention the special interest each business takes in their town and district
3538156 if they want small business to remain viable to continue to supply all these benefits they must make an effort to shop locally
3538157 it is a fallacy with petrol prices as they are today that one can travel to a larger centre and come home having made a saving on your shopping
3538158 locals need to support locals and keep the broad selection and variety of goods and services viable on a local level
3538159 the pollies for small business program is a practical way of ensuring politicians have a better understanding of what it is really like to be a small business owner
3538160 were going to have a lot of the basics on the menu some really nice salads at lunchtime thai chicken salad and shrimp salads
3538161 and some of the pizzas we made popular at corleones flatbread pizzas are a big seller for us and some nice corned beef and french dip sandwiches
3538162 for dinnertime im hoping well get into a harry carays kind of place

3538171 there have been many challenges but the greatest one is probably trying to get to know the strengths and weaknesses of the organization both on and off the ice this takes time and being around the people on a daily basis i believe any strong organization starts with good people in the right places and now that i have spent a full year here i feel that i have a better handle on our strengths and weaknesses
3538172 bring top minor league professional mens basketball back to cleveland
3538173 you look at kids they take their shoes off and run around all the time maybe his feet were hurting that day well educate him a little bit more and tell him about keeping his shoes on till he gets inside we dont like things to happen but they happen what can you do other than try to educate them
3538174 it would take a serious unexpected setback for him to be unavailable for the cowboys game
3538175 dude thats in play get the heck off the wall
3538176 id go id probably go like milan or something like that where i grew up or something like that peace out do you know any reasonable person that would turn down 50 million dollars because i grew up in italy it has more significance to me because im more familiar with it ive been there and i still have friends there im thinking about buying a house out there it would be nothing to me to be able to do that
3538177 if someone wants to throw 50 million on the table for me we can talk
3538178 they throw 30 40 50 million a year at me i cant turn that down i think right now its very exciting theyre starting a new buzz you start to do a little research and they got money over there you stay in the states you make the max you make 18 million take out taxes and you have 9 10 you have an opportunity to go somewhere and make 25 30 tax free we might have to pack our bags
3538179 it would definitely be something id consider you can never say never to anything the olympics have shown how this game has grown its not just the united states game anymore its the worlds game
3538180 as a businessman i would have to consider it if my wife was down and the money was right
3538181 from a business standpoint you have to at least listen to every offer
3538182 youre right only cska dynamo and khimki are the teams with huge money in europe along with olympiakos and panathinaikos from greece so if we are talking about lebron or kobe or any other superstar it all comes down to these five teams bc triumph formerly dynamo moscow region surprised everybody by signing krstic to a three million euro per year deal but its their only big buy so far and nobody knows what will happen next i think it is possible that one of these teams will find the money for an nba superstar yet 50 million is still outlandish were not talking about going roughly from 25 million team payroll to 32 million as was the case with childress but going from 25 million to 75 million it would make a little more sense if we were talking about what would be a 50 million a year nba contract which would equal about 17 million euros per year im sure that teams are preparing for talks and nobody is actually ready to just throw out 50 million now anyway its hard to predict anything because this will be an unprecedented move that will change the way we think now about sports contracts cska used to be the team paying crazy salaries compared to other teams in europe but for the last several seasons they have been coached by ettore messina and instead of chasing big names they try to get players that will fit the system this season when everyone is signing superstars the biggest names cska got are zoran planinic and erazem lorbek they are not the team that puts all their eggs in one basket messina is only signed until next summer though so well see what happens also cska has the most success in terms of public relations is well known everywhere in the world and they may be ready to spend to make the next step in these terms if youre nike youd want your player to be in moscow which is one of the world capitals playing for a well known team khimki have been big spenders for several years and this summer they went over the top the reason for that is they are hoping to get a contract with euroleague next summer when it could become a closed league it was announced that euroleague will look at marketability of the teams so khimki signed not just quality players but well known players from nba teams and successful national teams in carlos delfino and jorge garbajosa they went for the biggest names they thought they could target each player received what would be a 9 million a year nba contract the euroleague contract talks will continue next summer and if khimki are desperate to sign the deal they will have to spend crazy money actually if i were the euroleague i would quietly put pressure on the team and say you get lebron and well sign you to a euroleague contract on the other hand this is a smaller city in moscow region dynamo has a reputation of an underarchieving team here in russia they spend cska like money on their roster yet the results are very different this year they finally got a great coach in david blatt and also signed bostjan nachbar to what would be again a 9 million nba contract they are rumored to be targeting ben gordon now that its known that players of this caliber are available for the right money once again its impossible to tell how far the team can go in terms of spending because whats happening now is unprecedented for years dynamo has been the richest team that is not in the euroleague and they are desperate to get in the league still it is not surprising that it was a greek team which was the first to hand out a huge contract their owners have the most freedom to act because they are just that owners one person for each team russian teams have to find sponsors for each deal either from businesses or local governments which takes time and pursuasion sic if a greek owner feels like spending it will take him a second to give a go ahead to team management eccentric billionaire fan owners is not what russia is about
3538183 even more enticing to james has to be the revelation that earl boykins recently signed contract with italys virtus bologna includes income from bolognas sponsorship and marketing arms due to the nbas collective bargaining agreement this sort of arrangement is off limits in the nba but its exactly what lebron james inc is looking for james is right he wont become a billionaire by playing basketball so he and his management team have begun to look for more than endorsement dollars theyre now interested in equity stakes in the companies lebron lends his name to what if the owners of cska moscow or olympiacos the two teams reported to have contacted james offered him equity stakes in the teams and or outside business ventures they accumulated their billions in in addition to his playing salary an equity stake in a billion dollar business would pay dividends long after james called it quits on the hardwood and it would inch james closer to his stated goal of becoming the richest man in the world if the nbas collective bargaining agreement allowed it you can bet that james would negotiate an ownership percentage in the cavs or the soon to be brooklyn nets or the new york knicks any discussions between james and olympiacos or cska moscow will begin with what the euroleague can offer that the nba cannot
3538184 i wonder if the nba will be forced to adopt an mls style
3538185 european teams have rules that limit the number of non european teams that can be on their roster
3538186 but seriously cleveland cant pay 50 million for lebron nor should any american team pay that
3538187 cleveland shouldnt pay nor should any american team yadda yadda
3538188 a slave is a man that waits on another to set him free
3538189 the decrease in sales stems from an ongoing decline in the level of consumer confidence in canada as well as a decline in housing starts and resale of single unit homes especially in alberta
3538190 it is basically that we are doing some maintenance and it is unavoidable that the data centre has to be taken down
3538191 it is quite an unusual occurrence but its been scheduled for time when it has least impact on our users
3538192 all departments have continuity plans in place and there are back up systems that they can use during this
3538193 the universitys it department has always donated obsolete equipment to good causes as we dont like to see working equipment go to waste but with the introduction of the weee directive legal requirements had to take priority computer aid provided the ideal solution for our disposal policy instead of being broken down and recycled our pcs are given a new lease of life to help disadvantaged communities while computer aid provides all the legal documentation necessary to prove weee compliance
3538194 lindens customer base has been shrinking for six consecutive months

3538198 the department had not been informed of the fbis plans if they deem it necessary to do that we welcome it
3538199 ive been here 19 years and this agency has been in existence since 1696 the office of the sheriff of prince georges county has never been under a civil rights review or no one has ever called for the department of justice to come in
3538200 its uncommon to see people dressed up like this so the victims were watching them
3538201 customers dont care how hard you worked only whether you solved their problems and raising money from investors is harder than selling to customers because there are so few of them
3538202 we failed to accurately count the number of plates and partially used an inappropriate method to make the segment
3538203 we were vague about how we counted the plates and dishes for instance counting one plate with four pieces of the same dish as four dishes
3538204 cuando la religi n y la pol tica van en el mismo coche los pasajeros creen que nada podr ponerse en su camino

3538206 we have to adapt to the environmental changes that have already taken place or that we can reasonably expect will occur because of climate change
3538207 the city was built with an assumption of an environmental baseline and climate change in many ways changes that baseline
3538208 some of these transformations can potentially be catastrophic as large storms others might be more subtle and difficult to discern over the short term
3538209 and what do you think is the best thing about being 104
3538210 then ill be sure my daughters will visit me twice a week
3538211 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3538212 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through

3538215 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3538216 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

3538219 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3538220 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3538221 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3538222 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3538224 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3538225 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

3538238 it was in worse condition than we anticipated due to corrosion
3538239 we have to adapt to the environmental changes that have already taken place or that we can reasonably expect will occur because of climate change
3538240 the city was built with an assumption of an environmental baseline and climate change in many ways changes that baseline
3538241 some of these transformations can potentially be catastrophic as large storms others might be more subtle and difficult to discern over the short term

3538352 those responsible should rot in hell and i dont blame their mother for saying they should die
3538353 it was a colossal failure because the justice system was never permitted to fulfil its function
3538354 it was stymied by a botched investigation and it was stymied by unco operative police witnesses or to be more precise unco operative witnesses who happened to be police officers
3538355 it was nothing less than a betrayal of the rule of law
3538356 no idea no idea no clue i have no idea all the way through
3538357 the prospect of all of those witnesses having that kind of a response is thoroughly untenable
3538358 it was far easier than it should have been for this part of the investigation to become a casualty of winnipeg police officers some of whom gave higher regard to their loyalty to each other and to self preservation than to their solemn oaths to uphold the law
3538359 the outstanding issue is whether he did this because he didnt want to be involved in ruining derek harvey zenk or whether he was actually trying to protect him
3538360 we do not believe that an internal provincial police investigation would be seen as fair transparent objective or credible enough to bring all the answers that people are looking for
3538361 we found this meeting very positive and it allowed the families to ask questions which we answered
3538362 we reassured the family that we are taking this investigation seriously this inquiry will be handled with integrity impartiality and with rigour
3538363 were not at the point where we have to meet these people right away
3538364 the advantage of a public inquiry is that it will look for the motives that feed this hatred of the police system
3538365 the other advantage of a public inquiry is that we will be able to analyze the intervention methods of police

3538370 across the country about 50 to 60 per cent of our locations would be classified in residential type areas
3538371 we havent really gone through a process at all of saying that we should be out of residential areas because we do feel confident we manage the processes very well
3538372 theyve got to stop it you cant build something like that in residential areas
3538373 never should have done it three years ago youre not going to see that no more around here
3538374 you got all these politicians that think they know everything
3538375 thats a public safety document and that theyve barred even the city that 24 hours after the explosion those records arent in the mayors office is an absolute outrage
3538376 i have a position on that at this point but im not prepared to discuss it
3538377 i would think that the premier will come out take a stand on this
3538378 undoubtedly hes assessing the total effect on the province and im sure well hear from him on it very soon
3538379 we think the liberals are on the run they know it we know it
3538380 the vast majority of families in newfoundland are going to be significant beneficiaries of any change that the liberal government brings in
3538381 of course the tories will lie about our plan thats what we expect them to do the fact of the matter is were talking about the biggest tax cut for ordinary families in a generation
3538382 everybody knows from premier williams on down that the harper approach to government is a disaster for newfoundland
3538383 the messaging here is harder for the liberals its kind of a leap of faith to suggest that this shift will actually work
3538384 at this point the prime minister has yet to accept all or any of those options put forward by premier williams some eight months ago
3538385 everyone has their own opinion of what i should do but i think that its my life
3538386 i know there might be wrong decisions that i make and there might be right decisions that i make but theyre decisions that i make for myself and i think the only decision i can make is to be 100 per cent supportive of myself and not doubt myself at all

3538390 the comments i havent them or read them i dont really care actually
3538391 people will have their opinion about me and obviously a couple of various criticisms or compliments will come my way and i may hear about them or i may accidentally read about them but id rather them have opinions about me than not have opinions about me so thats just the way it is
3538392 i dont listen to them i listen to the people that are close to me and i respect
3538393 but in the end everything comes down to my decision
3538394 michelle is a very talented young athlete that has unbelievable potential
3538395 its unfortunate the way things have gone for michelle in the last little while but michelle is a talent we need that talent on our tour she brings a lot of people out to watch her
3538396 you know i hope for michelle that she can continue being a kid at stanford and ill be selfish to say a good and important part of our tour
3538397 the year was inconsistent ive kind of had my ups and downs but i feel my game has gotten better over the summer

3538420 the endangered species act has evolved into something that is less concerned with helping species and more concerned with exerting economic control and holding up or sometimes stopping important economic activity
3538421 were very dependent on the same environment those animals are dependent on so like a canary going down into cave if the canary dies were next
3538422 are you open now to having a vote for offshore drilling
3538423 we will have a vote its not strictly on offshore drilling well have a vote on an array of initiatives that will protect the consumer that will increase the domestic supply and that will reverse global warming and among those may be some restricting drilling in protected areas if they can comply with the three criteria that i mentioned
3538424 absolutely not the gimmick that the republicans have come up with drill drill drill in the protected areas and it will bring down the price of oil is a complete misrepresneation to the american people there are plenty of places weve had to drill at 68 million acres in the lower 48 where people can drill more than 10 million acres in alaska which are permitted for drilling
3538425 usually if chips fail the drive goes bad and an enterprises loses information we make so its nearly impossible an eight in one million chance to fail
3538426 were the first company to use raid class redundancy and reliability using flashback protection at the card level
3538427 we wanted to partner with 10 000 little micro ideas to bring cleveland this exciting and fun afternoon of activities presenting all the projects that are building positive momentum in cleveland 10 000 is an organization of enthusiastic and committed grassroots leaders who are working to strengthen this region this event provides a great opportunity for us to showcase the business communitys economic development initiatives and we in turn can hear from you about your 10 000 visions of cleveland
3538428 bills comments really helped to shed some light on this issue for me particularly what
3538429 on the same weekend that bernie mac and isaac hayes were called to meet their
3538430 what i will miss her role modeling courage and relentless peer review what i wont
3538431 straight shooters are hard to come by in politics i hope we can find more
3538432 very nice article george she sounds like a very special lady who shot straight as
3538433 this is just another way hes making history and we want to be part of it
3538434 i was so nervous i dont know if i saw it really well but i think its a good likeness
3538435 they showed them yesterday and i looked at them online i was planning to buy them but never dreamed we would do this
3538436 presley place where the money will go we contribute to them every year
3538437 also i want that on display in my living room in a curio cabinet
3538438 the jewish people as a whole will be its own messiah it will attain
3538439 great strength of thought and insight its design is well above the abilities of an ordinary mind it is more complicated than a nuclear bomb
3538440 education in a scientific society may i think be best conceived after the analogy of the education provided by the jesuits the jesuits provided one sort of education for the boys who were to become ordinary men of the world and another for those who were to become members of the society of jesus in like manner the scientific rulers will provide one kind of education for ordinary men and women and another for those who are to become holders of scientific power ordinary men and women will be expected to be docile industrious punctual thoughtless and contented of these qualities probably contentment will be considered the most important in order to produce it all the researches of psycho analysis behaviourism and biochemistry will be brought into play
3538441 as a technique for acquiring power behaviourism is i think superior to psycho analysis it embodies the methods which have always been adopted by those who train animals or drill soldiers it utilizes the force of habit the strength of which has always been recognized and as we saw when we were considering pavlov it makes it possible both to cause and to cure neurasthenia and hysteria the conflicts which appear in psycho analysis as emotional re appear in behaviourism as conflicts between habits or between a habit and a reflex if a child were severely beaten every time it sneezed it is probable that a phantasy world would in time build itself up in his mind around the conception of sneezing he would dream of heaven as a place where the spirits of the blest sneeze unceasingly or on the contrary he might think of hell as a place of punishment for those who live in open sternutation in this sort of way the problems brought to the fore by psycho analysis can i think be dealt with on behaviourist lines at the same time it should be admitted that these problems whose importance is very great would probably not have come to the fore but for the psycho analytic approach for the practical purposes of educational technique i think it will be found that the educator should behave as a psycho analyst when he is concerned with matters touching powerful instincts but as a behaviourist in matters which a child views as emotionally unimportant for example affection for parents should be viewed in the psycho analytic manner but brushing teeth in the behaviourist manner
3538442 the most important applications of psycho analytic theory are to education these applications are as yet in an experimental stage and owing to the hostility of the authorities they can only be made on a very small scale it is however already evident that moral and emotional education has hitherto been conducted on wrong lines and has produced maladjustments which have been sources of cruelty timidity stupidity and other unfortunate mental characteristics i think it possible that psycho analytic theory may be absorbed into something more scientific but i do not doubt that something of what psycho analysis has to suggest in regard to education will be found permanently valid and of immense importance
3538443 so far no experiments have been made to test the effect of x rays on the human embryo
3538444 so far we have been considering those ways of influencing the mental life which proceed by mental means as in psycho analysis or by means of the conditioned reflex as in behaviourism there are however other methods which may in time prove of immense importance these are the methods which operate through physiological means such as the administering of drugs the curing of cretinism by means of iodine is so far the most remarkable of these methods in switzerland all salt for human consumption is obliged by law to be iodized and this measure has been found adequate as a preventive of cretinism the work of cannon and others concerning the influence of the ductless glands upon the emotions has become widely known and it is clear that by administering artificially the substances which the ductless glands provide a profound effect can be produced upon temperament and character the effects of alcohol opium and various other drugs have long been familiar but these effects are on the balance harmful unless the drug is taken with unusual moderation there is however no a priori reason why drugs should not be discovered which have a wholly beneficial effect i have never myself observed any but good effects to flow from the drinking of tea at any rate if it is china tea it is possible also that psychological marvels may become possible through pre natal treatment one of the most eminent philosophers of our day regards his superiority to his brothers perhaps humorously as due to the fact that shortly before his birth his mother was in a carriage which rolled down the simplon in an accident i do not suggest that this method should be adopted in the hope of turning us all into philosophers but perhaps in time we shall discover some more peaceable means of endowing the foetus with intelligence education used to begin at eight years old with the learning of the latin declensions now under the influence of psycho analysis it begins at birth it is to be expected that with the advance of experimental embryology the important part of education will be found to be pre natal this is already the case with fishes and newts but in regard to them the scientist is not hampered by education authorities the power of psychological technique to mould the mentality of the individual is still in its infancy and is not yet fully realized there can i think be little doubt that it will increase enormously in the near future science has given us in succession power over inanimate nature power over plants and animals and finally power over human beings each power involves its own kinds of dangers and perhaps the dangers involved in power over human beings are the greatest but that is a matter that we will consider at a later stage
3538445 whether men will be happy in the paradise i do not know
3538446 it is to be expected that advances in physiology and psychology will give governments much more control over individual mentality than they now have even in totalitarian countries fichte laid it down that education should aim at destroying free will so that after pupils have left school they shall be incapable throughout the rest of their lives of thinking or acting otherwise than as their schoolmasters would have wished but in his day this was an unattainable ideal what he regarded as the best system in existence produced karl marx in future such failures are not likely to occur where there is dictatorship diet injections and injunctions will combine from a very early age to produce the sort of character and the sort of beliefs that the authorities consider desirable and any serious criticism of the powers that be will become psychologically impossible even if all are miserable all will believe themselves happy because the government will tell them that they are so
3538447 while it is rather rash to make detailed prophecies it is i think fairly clear that in future a human body from the moment of conception will not be regarded merely as something which must be left to grow in accordance with natural forces with no human interference beyond what is required for the preservation of health the tendency of scientific technique is to cause everything to be regarded as not just a brute datum but raw material for the carrying out of some human purpose the child and even the embryo will come to be viewed more and more in this way as the mentality connected with scientific technique becomes more dominant in this as in all other forms of scientific power there are possibilities of good and possibilities of evil science alone will not decide which is to prevail
3538448 science when it has once acquired a firm hold upon social organization is hardly likely to stop short at those biological aspects of human life which have hitherto been left to the joint guidance of religion and instinct we may i think assume that both the quantity and the quality of the population will be carefully regulated by the state but that sexual intercourse apart from children will be regarded as a private matter so long as it is not allowed to interfere with work as regards quantity the state statisticians will determine as carefully as they can whether the population of the world at the moment is above or below the number which leads to the greatest material comfort per head they will also take account of all such changes of technique as can be foreseen no doubt the usual rule will be to aim at a stationary population but if some important invention such as artificial food should greatly cheapen the production of necessaries an increase of population might for a time be thought wise i shall however assume that in normal times the world government will decree a stationary population if we were right in supposing that the scientific society will have different social grades according to the kind of work to be performed we may assume also that it will have uses for human beings who are not of the highest grade of intelligence it is probable that there will be certain kinds of labour mainly performed by negroes and that manual workers in general will be bred for patience and muscle rather than for brains the governors and experts on the contrary will be bred chiefly for their intellectual powers and their strength of character assuming that both kinds of breeding are scientifically carried out there will come to be an increasing divergence between the two types making them in the end almost different species scientific breeding in any truly scientific form would at present encounter insuperable obstacles both from religion and from sentiment to carry it out scientifically it would be necessary as among domestic animals to employ only a small percentage of males for purposes of breeding it may be thought that religion and sentiment will always succeed in opposing an immovable veto to such a system i wish i could think so but i believe that sentiment is quite extraordinarily plastic and that the individualistic religion to which we have been accustomed is likely to be increasingly replaced by a religion of devotion to the state among russian communists this has already happened in any case what is demanded is scarcely as difficult a control of natural impulses as is involved in the celibacy of the catholic priesthood wherever remarkable achievements are possible and are at the same time such as to satisfy mens moral idealism the love of power is capable of swallowing up the instinctive life of the affections especially if an outlet is permitted to purely physical sexual impulses traditional religion which has been violently dispossessed in russia will suffer a setback everywhere if the russian experiment proves successful in any case its outlook is difficult to reconcile with that of industrialism and scientific technique traditional religion was based upon a sense of mans impotence in the face of natural forces whereas scientific technique induces a sense of the impotence of natural forces in the face of mans intelligence combined with this sense of power a certain degree of austerity in regard to the softer pleasures is quite natural one sees it already in many of those who are creating the mechanistic society of the future in america this austerity has taken the form of protestant piety in russia of devotion to communism i think therefore that there is hardly any limit to the departures from traditional sentiment which science may introduce into the question of reproduction if the simultaneous regulation of quantity and quality is taken seriously in the future we may expect that in each generation some 25 per cent of women and some 5 per cent of men will be selected to be the parents of the next generation while the remainder of the population will be sterilized which will in no way interfere with their sexual pleasures but will merely render these pleasures destitute of social importance the women who are selected for breeding will have to have eight or nine children each but will not be expected to perform any other work except the suckling of the children for a suitable number of months no obstacles will be placed upon their relations with sterile men or upon the relations of sterile men and women with each other but reproduction will be regarded as a matter which concerns the state and will not be left to the free choice of the persons concerned perhaps it will be found that artificial impregnation is more certain and less embarrassing since it will obviate the need of any personal contact between the father and mother of the prospective child sentiments of personal affection may still be connected with intercourse not intended to be fruitful while impregnation will be regarded in an entirely different manner more in the light of a surgical operation so that it will be thought not ladylike to have it performed in the natural manner the qualities for which parents will be chosen will differ greatly according to the status which it is hoped the child will occupy in the governing class a considerable degree of intelligence will be demanded of parents perfect health will of course be indispensable so long as gestation is allowed to persist to its natural period mothers will also have to be selected by their capacity for easy delivery and will therefore have to be free from an unduly narrow pelvis it is probable however that as time goes on the period of gestation will be shortened and that later months of foetal development will take place in an incubator this would also free mothers from the need of suckling their children and would thus make maternity a not very onerous matter the care of infants intended to belong to the governing class would seldom be left to the mothers mothers would be selected by their eugenic qualities and these would not necessarily be the qualities required in a nurse on the other hand the early months of pregnancy might be more burdensome than at present since the foetus would be subjected to various kinds of scientific treatment intended to affect beneficially not only its own characteristics but those of its possible descendants fathers would of course have nothing to do with their own children there would be in general only one father to every five mothers and it is quite likely that he would never have even seen the mothers of his children the sentiment of paternity would thus disappear completely probably in time the same thing would happen though to a slightly less degree in regard to mothers if birth were prematurely induced and the child separated from its mother at birth maternal sentiment would have little chance to develop
3538449 among the workers it is probable that less elaborate care would be taken since it is easier to breed for muscle than to breed for brains and it is not unlikely that women would be allowed to bring up their own children in the old fashioned natural manner there would not be among the workers the same need as among the governors for fanatical devotion to the state and there would not be therefore on the part of the government the same jealousy of the private affections among the governors one must suppose all private sentiments would be viewed with suspicion a man and woman who showed any ardent devotion to each other would be regarded as they are at present regarded by moralists when they are not married there would be professional nurses in cr ches and professional teachers in nursery schools but they would be considered to be failing in their duty if they felt any special affection for special children children who showed any special affection for a particular adult would be separated form that adult ideas of this kind are already widespread they will be found suggested for example in dr john b watsons book on education the tendency of the scientific manipulator is to regard all private affections as unfortunate freudians have shown us that they are the sources of complexes administrators realize that they stand in the way of a whole hearted devotion to business the church sanctioned certain kinds of love while condemning others but the modern ascetic is more thoroughgoing and condemns all kinds of love equally as mere folly and waste of time
3538450 what should we expect of the mental make up of people in such a world the manual workers may i think be fairly happy one may assume that the rulers will be successful in making the manual workers foolish and frivolous work will not be too severe and there will be endless amusements of a trivial sort owing to sterilization love affairs need not have awkward consequences so long as they are not between a man and woman who are both of them unsterilized in this way a life of easygoing and frivolous pleasure may be provided for the manual workers combined of course with a superstitious reverence for the governors instilled in childhood and prolonged by the propaganda to which adults will be exposed the psychology of the governors will be a more difficult matter they will be expected to display an arduous and hard working devotion to the ideal of the scientific state and to sacrifice to this ideal all the softer sentiments such as love of wife and children friendships between fellow workers whether of the same or of different sexes will tend to become ardent and will not infrequently overstep the limits which the public moralists will have fixed in such a case the authorities will separate the friends unless in doing so they will interrupt some important research or administrative undertaking when for some such public reason friends are not separated they will be admonished by means of governmental microphones the censors will listen in to their conversations and if these should at any time become tinged with sentiment disciplinary measures will be adopted all the deeper feelings will be frustrated with the sole exception of devotion to science and the state the governors will of course have their amusements for leisure hours i do not see how art or literature could flourish in such a world nor do i think that the emotions from which they spring and to which they appeal would meet with governmental approval but athletics of a strenuous kind will be encouraged among the young of the governing class and dangerous sports will be considered valuable as a training in those habits of mind and body by which authority over the manual workers will be maintained love making among the sterilized will be subjected to no restrictions either of law or of public opinion but it will be casual and temporary involving none of the deeper feelings and no serious affection persons suffering from unendurable boredom will be encouraged to ascend mount everest or fly over the south pole but the need for such distractions will be regarded as a sign of mental or physical ill health in such a world though there may be pleasure there will be no joy the result will be a type displaying the usual characteristics of vigorous ascetics they will be harsh and unbending tending towards cruelty in their ideals and their readiness to consider that the infliction of pain is necessary for he public good i do not imagine that pain will be much inflicted as punishment for sin since no sin will be recognized except insubordination and failure to carry out the purposes of the state it is more probable that the sadistic impulses which the asceticism will generate will find their outlet in scientific experiment the advancement of knowledge will be held to justify much torture of individuals by surgeons biochemists and experimental psychologist as time goes on the amount of added knowledge required to justify a given amount of pain will diminish and the number of governors attracted to the kinds of research necessitating cruel experiments will increase just as the sun worship of the aztecs demanded the painful death of thousands of human beings annually so the new scientific religion will demand its holocausts of sacred victims gradually the world will grow more dark and more terrible strange perversions of instinct will first lurk in the dark corners and then gradually overwhelm the men in high places sadistic pleasures will not suffer the moral condemnation that will be meted out to the softer joys since like the persecutions of the inquisition they will be found in harmony with the prevailing asceticism in the end such a system must break down either in an orgy of bloodshed or in the rediscovery of joy such at least is the only ray of hope to lighten the darkness of these visions of cassandra but perhaps in permitting this ray of hope we have allowed ourselves to yield to a foolish optimism perhaps by means of injections and drugs and chemicals the population could be induced to bear whatever its scientific masters may decide to be for its good new forms of drunkenness involving no subsequent headache may be discovered and new forms of intoxication may be invented so delicious that for their sakes these are possibilities in a world governed by knowledge without love and power without delight the man drunk with power is destitute of wisdom and so long as he rules the world the world will be a place devoid of beauty and of joy
3538451 take again such a matter as housing in england individualism leads most families to prefer a small house of their own rather than an apartment in a large house the result is that the suburbs of london are spread out through mile after mile of dreariness to the immense detriment of the women and children each housewife cooks an abominable dinner at great expenditure of labour for an infuriated husband the children when they come home from school or while they are too young to go to school find themselves cooped up in small stuffy premises where either they are a nuisance to their parents or their parents are a nuisance to them in a more sensible community each family would occupy a part of an immense building with a courtyard in the middle there would be no individual cooking but only communal meals children as soon as they were no longer at the breast would spend their day in large airy halls under the care of women possessing the knowledge the training and the temperament required for making young children happy the wives who at present drudge all day doing wasteful work badly would be set free to earn their living outside the home the benefit of such a system to the mothers and still more to the children would be incalculable at the rachel macmillan nursery school it was found that about 90 per cent of the children had rickets when they first came and almost all were cured at the end of the first year in the school in the ordinary home the necessary modicum of light and air and good food cannot be provided whereas all these things can be provided quite cheaply if they are provided for many children at once the freedom to cause ones children to grow up stunted and crippled on the ground that one is too fond of them to part with them is a freedom which is certainly not in the public interest
3538452 the third stage of agrarian reform constituting the basic feature of the
3538453 everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers
3538454 the results suggest that efforts should be made to develop drugs that could be given in a controlled clinical or treatment environment in which addicts would have their most potent drug memories reactivated
3538455 this is an example of hypothesis driven basic research that can be readily translated to the treatment of cocaine addiction in humans
3538456 was recording studios without any room reverb or ambience the playing room at windmill lane studios was designed to be totally dead and you can hear it on the drums it wasnt until the boy sessions that we figured out that we had to pull the drum kit into the entrance hall after the receptionist had gone home to get a decent drum sound with its three story stairwell and stone and tiled surfaces it was a great live room
3538457 it didnt sit well with us not being there but we were callow 18 year olds and steve a veteran of many great records so we let him do it his way its a great mix but it was too acoustic guitar heavy for us
3538458 it was obvious to everyone that we were driving with two wheels over the edge of the cliff and it drew from us and particularly bono a level of creativity that we had not seen before
3538459 give me more than half of your honestly earned money or you will be arrested
3538460 you know what the greatest part of that was they never once said anything they never booed until we became that team that was able to beat canada
3538461 when they got scared of us as a group playing against them thats when they started
3538462 that was a great feeling it really made me feel good
3538463 when you first start your career you wonder if youre ever going to play and then all of a sudden within the blink of an eye its over
3538464 i appreciated everything that usa hockey ever did because im not sure i ever would have been an nhler without the opportunity they gave me
3538465 there was a lot of proud guys in that locker room when i look back on it i still have that same feeling
3538466 it was probably the most talented team ive ever been around
3538467 it was one of my greatest moments in the game
3538468 i had never really been a champion id had a load of personal success but i had never really had any team success
3538469 after we won i remember standing on the blue line next to chris chelios and i asked him what i should do because i had never won before
3538470 the biggest change in hockey for women i noticed was when we returned from nagano in 98
3538471 i never needed confirmation about it being the right decision
3538472 just having them show the faith in me that they wanted me apart of the program was all i needed
3538473 con esa confianza se or presidente le queremos pedir su apoyo para modificar un tema muy importante para el crecimiento de nuestras empresas el r gimen fiscal que hoy por hoy tenemos para las empresas sociales con todo respeto quiero decirle que para que nosotras podamos ser esas empresas exitosas que el pa s necesita requerimos de una modificaci n al r gimen fiscal m s adecuado a nuestras posibilidades
3538474 no se puede tratar igual a los que no son iguales somos empresarias sociales en v as de crecimiento usted conoce nuestra realidad y nuestro compromiso con la legalidad
3538475 muchas veces dificulta nuestro crecimiento somos empresarias en peque o en consolidaci n y el r gimen fiscal no nos considera as nos trata igual que a las empresas con niveles de facturaci n m s grandes y con otras herramientas de producci n y comercializaci n que nosotras apenas vamos adquiriendo sin considerar que las empresas que iniciamos avanzamos lentamente
3538476 thats right i said it ford motor co will be the quality leader
3538477 the gain in terms of prostate cancer mortality from radical prostatectomy still holds out 10 to 15 years after the operation
3538478 they are just defending their nests if you walk into their territory they will attack you but they dont attack for any other reason
3538479 these people were wandering around a bit aimlessly and went into a skua territory and the birds were telling them to get out of the way
3538480 if you raise your profile the birds will come down to the highest point if you lift a stick they will tend to touch the stick rather than you
3538481 ive been dive bombed in shetland and elsewhere its an occupational hazard they are much more aggressive in mid egg stage and very young chick stage you could be 100 150 yards away and be dive bombed
3538482 they swat the back of your head with their feet or use their wing tips to belt you
3538483 ive felt the sting from a great skuas feet its like getting a whack on the head with a ruler if youre not expecting it it can freak you out
3538484 local people will know all about bonxies but most people in britain will never have seen them they are impressive birds and to suddenly find youre being attacked by them can be a bit of a surprise
3538485 if a bonxie does hit you you know youve been hit but its very rare occurrence
3538486 they will threaten you and come whizzing past your ears but as soon as you walk out of their territory they will leave you alone
3538487 may not be serving well the interests of either airlines or passengers
3538488 it is the most lucrative with tourism appeal and the financial sector while glasgow is more leisure focused which produces lower margins
3538489 scottish students seem to have been hit especially hard by the recent downturn in the economy
3538490 our research shows that the prices of the items students buy things like rent groceries entertainments have risen faster in scotland than the rest of the uk
3538491 scotland does remain relatively cheap though and the funding system for students is more generous
3538492 our report scotlands lost opportunities revealed a third of students had considered dropping out because of financial hardship and the situation is only being exacerbated in this challenging financial climate as the cost of living rises its an accepted fact many students will work through their studies
3538493 nus scotland is deeply worried that students are being forced to increase their working hours in some cases to more than 20 hours a week to keep up with the rising cost of living its a timetable that will undoubtedly jeopardise their studies
3538494 data on graduate debt from the student loans company clearly shows students in scotland leave with significantly lower levels of debt compared with students in england in 2008 scots left with an average debt a little over half of the figure for england
3538495 we decided to put lin miaoke on the live picture while using yang peiyis voice
3538496 the reason for this is we must put our countrys interest first the girl on the picture must be flawless in terms of her facial expression and the great feeling she can give to people
3538497 this is like a voice over for a cartoon character why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer
3538498 because of poor visibility some previously recorded footage may have been used
3538499 this just goes to show they have as sophisticated a view of tv and vast events as we do
3538500 it was clever to have material for the opening ready to be fed directly to the tv
3538501 the fact is all of tv involves cheating i just hope we in london are twice as good at cheating by 2012
3538502 im not sure this counts as trickery in the modern virtual world the effect was pretty enough
3538503 all it means is the chinese are rapidly getting to be smart up to date folk who will soon be on top of the pr game they have come a long way since the cultural revolution
3538504 it is a political document it is an agreement of principles and i think we have full coincidence of principles
3538505 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
3538506 the russian state has once again shown its true face
3538507 what we must do now is ensure that its a lasting ceasefire
3538508 the first unhcr humanitarian airlift flight carrying relief supplies for civilians affected by the conflict arrived in georgia this morning as the estimated number of people uprooted by the fighting approached 100 000
3538509 that would amount to some 56 000 people from gori on the move officials said that most had gone toward tbilisi and that most would return home once the threat subsided
3538510 the situation on the ground is deteriorating sparking a significant movement of population
3538511 we need unrestricted humanitarian access to the civilian population and to the wounded and to enable medical personnel and ambulances to take care of the dead and wounded
3538512 one of our top priorities when it is possible will be to get safe drinking water to tskhinvali
3538513 the georgians opened fire on us from the windows of five storey apartment buildings on either side of the road
3538514 you wont see any more georgians on the territory of south ossetia again i dont think they will dare return
3538515 this is not a protest against land transfer in fact this is anger against india
3538516 i see this will have a bad impact and considering that pakistan is going through a bad turmoil now the overall impact on the peace process will not be very positive
3538517 such statements by leaders of a foreign country do not help the situation nor do they contribute to creating the atmosphere necessary for the dialogue process between india and pakistan to move forward
3538518 i have been an active trade unionist all my life and i believe i have taken those values into my time in politics i hope i can continue to do so if elected as leader
3538519 i believe i can offer scottish labour a new voice and a fresh start and im very happy with the positive response ive received to that message from elected politicians trade unionists and from party members across all parts of scotland
3538520 it will only further deter students from the poorest backgrounds from going to university in the first place and the scottish labour party must stand on the side of students on this issue
3538521 i firmly believe that students who need to work alongside their degrees should not be taxed for doing so
3538522 people who deal with the public provide a great service to our society and should be able to go about their work without fear of attack or intimidation
3538523 i want to see the existing legislation widened to allow courts to deal with incidents as a specific offence carrying a maximum penalty of nine months in jail a fine of 5 000 or both
3538524 in all we expect cpi inflation to rise to about 5 7 per cent year on year in august as household energy prices rise even though oil prices are lower reaching about 5 per cent year on year by year end thereafter even with the recent drop in global commodity prices and the likelihood that the uk economy is in recession we expect cpi inflation to stay above 3 per cent until quarter three next year staying also above the 2 per cent target throughout 2009 and 2010
3538525 within the next couple of months looks well off the agenda
3538526 it is vital that pay rises keep pace with inflation to ensure that our standard of living is not slashed over coming months better pay would also improve consumer confidence and lessen the chances of a long and deep economic slowdown next year
3538527 profiteering oil firms or it is inevitable that wages will have to rise in response to these higher prices
3538528 certainly everything has gone up hugely feed went up a huge amount last year from about 146 a tonne to 220 a tonne the transport situation has had a huge impact on us as well we are paying about 300 a month extra on diesel
3538529 we have no way of controlling that either the cost of the grain or the amount we feed the birds the birds have to be fed and that is our biggest issue
3538530 it has been extremely difficult although the supermarkets have moved they generally moved a bit behind the prices we have had to pay
3538531 we have ordered food in advance knowing we would lose money if they did not move it has all been hand to mouth
3538532 pig farmers are suffering huge losses because they also have huge inputs and the marketplace is not matching that in terms of farm gate prices so they are making losses the eggs guys are just about staying afloat
3538533 it comes back to the supermarkets in the end there is this imbalance of power within the supply chain the supermarkets are at the top wielding all the power and farmers have very little negotiating power and get railroaded by the supermarkets at the moment we are seeing efforts from supermarkets to keep their shelf prices down so they can keep their customers happy
3538534 the fall in transactions is an effect of the credit crunch and i guess some people are just waiting to see what happens next
3538535 however in terms of prices the scottish housing market is reverting to type when you compare it with a few years ago
3538536 the bottom line is house price increases are at a level much nearer inflation which makes for a much more sensible and sustainable market
3538537 had the bailers been used i dont think there would have been water in the craft and this situation wouldnt have arisen in the first place
3538538 i would have loved the gold but i ended up with silver a medal is what i have been after for the last four years
3538539 id had a canoe at the side of the house for his entire life and he never even asked what it was doing there but wed turned up at the beach with his uncle who had two canoes on the roof of the car he and his brother asked their uncle for a shot of the canoe got in the sea and said they really liked it
3538540 the results showed that the preferences of women who began using the contraceptive pill shifted towards men with genetically similar odours
3538541 not only could mhc similarity in couples lead to fertility problems but it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the contraceptive pill as odour perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners
3538542 we are aware of jobs being cut the consequences on the wider legal profession could be disastrous
3538543 we are staring at a situation where there will be no career for the next generation of defence lawyers
3538544 we are seriously concerned about the situation and we cant wait for several months to talk about this and do something
3538545 we are going back to the scottish government with that at the end of the year
3538546 on the basis of newly published scottish government planning policy the housing element of the menie planning application should be refused contrary to what is advocated in spp3 the 500 open market houses proposed at menie do not meet any definition of a sustainable mixed community and of course the proposal continues to be entirely outwith the development plan
3538547 the applicants said they were directed by the council to a site supposedly within balmedie while this is not only bad value for the taxpayer it is also clearly against spp3 which the minister should take into account
3538548 allowing for 500 houses was not right in the first place and the subsequent deal on another site further contradicts the new government housing policy
3538549 repetition of the same old messages by these councillors is becoming tedious and frankly if i was the reporter i would take exception to their tactics which smack of desperation
3538550 it is quite clear by the note left by derek what his intentions were im quite sure his actions were motivated by the allegations
3538551 derek had a number of stresses in his life unrelated to his occupation as a combat medical technician
3538552 i am tired of living as i can never seem to do anything right in my life and my family could never be truly happy
3538553 i dont have any friends and people laugh at me
3538554 it is not only people with psychotic illnesses who commit suicide
3538555 he set himself standards a little too high and i expect took ribald commentary maybe a little too personally
3538556 i am tired of living as i can never seem to do anything right in my life and my family could never be truly happy i dont have any friends
3538557 funnily enough i have now become two jags man i have got two jags i have the old one the xjs but my wife cant get down into the very low seats of an xjs i have now bou advertisement ght a jaguar sovereign 12 months ago it cost me 4 000 so i am now a two jags so i can take my family out
3538558 i went into one of these 20mph areas and i was going about 25 or 30 on the speed camera and it brought it home to me you have to think about driving again in a different way
3538559 pc taylor took him in a come along hold and placed him in the rear of the vehicle i could see the lower part of pc taylors legs
3538560 i couldnt see the top part but i never saw or heard anything untoward
3538561 did not kick or assault the boy at any time
3538562 its rare for a whole advertisement team of sierra leoneans to go abroad and come back
3538563 it goes to show what sierra leone can do when it puts its mind to it we have managed to stick a feather in the cap for the country
3538564 i didnt want to disappear i want to come back here because i like my country and i want to play for the national team
3538565 i got the golden boot and it makes me want to play more
3538566 they were good goals i want to be like brazilian footballer ronaldo
3538567 what we are in discussion with the health department about is how we could utilise that contract to reward gps for working on holiday monday mornings for example as a way of providing an increased flexibility of service
3538568 i am on record as being very supportive of more flexible opening from gps
3538569 there is a logical extension here but we dont expect gps or any other worker to work round the clock at christmas or at these times of year so it is important that these things are taken forward in a proper way
3538570 given the bad feeling there has been around the imposition of extended hours i could see there being difficulties in expanding that further
3538571 when you look at the number of people who travel across from glasgow for the festivals it is really tiny compared to what it could be
3538572 fringe shows have the same appeal to people in glasgow as they do in edinburgh but its no use at all if the last train is at 11 30pm or midnight
3538573 edinburgh is awash with people at 3am at the moment and its just crazy that were not providing a proper rail service to get people home in the early hours
3538574 the current situation is absolutely shocking considering were in the 21st century
3538575 theres absolutely no reason why there couldnt be an hourly shuttle service between edinburgh and glasgow during the fringe its by far the safest and easiest way to travel
3538576 i would have thought there would be enough demand to justify much later rail services out of edinburgh during the festivals
3538577 the fact that more people than ever before used our services last year was an endorsement of our increased support for the events and a testament to the popularity of the festivals
3538578 they republican lawmakers and president george w bush have this thing that says drill offshore in the protected areas
3538579 well we can do that we can have a vote on that but it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public and not just a hoax on them
3538580 if speaker pelosi is truly sincere about having a vote on deep ocean oil and gas drilling to help bring down fuel costs she should use her power as speaker to call congress back into session immediately and schedule a vote
3538581 now we are protecting both the tourists and the ancient monuments
3538582 go away the police told us not to talk to you
3538583 ive been working here for 25 years now i dont know if i will be here tomorrow i have five children a wife what will happen to us
3538584 she suddenly said i went through the same thing i was in total shock
3538585 some people carry these things in silence for many years then it takes a long time to check them out
3538586 it is just a matter of time now i am in real fear for my own life
3538587 my wife and i went to the house and the car was in the drive and his front window was open and from that point i knew he was dead
3538588 i called him a couple of times but there was no answer his wife came out from where she lived and gave me grief i called my friend who is a policeman and two officers came down
3538589 they went into the garden looked into the window and found him dead
3538590 not on the high street but on a fringe venue
3538591 this is hindering my work my concern at the end of the day is that this is censorship its not on for someone other than an editor to decide what goes on tv
3538592 there is absolutely no question of journalists not being able to do their jobs
3538593 we are not trying to prevent anybody from doing anything we are trying to manage the situation so all parties can get on with what they are doing its not for any big brother type thing
3538594 the harbour porpoise population is one of the most threatened species of whale and dolphin in europe and giving protection to this species was one of the primary objectives for the area
3538595 we believe what theyve done is illegal and risks the lives of fishermen
3538596 we have a very clear knowledge of this and are placing the stones next to the old reef effectively extending it there is no damage
3538597 little prospect of offering their residents the standard of living to which they aspire
3538598 realistic about the ability of cities such as manchester leeds and newcastle to regenerate struggling neighbours such as liverpool bradford and sunderland
3538599 no one is suggesting that residents should be forced to move but we do argue that they should be told the reality of the position regeneration in the sense of convergence will not happen because it is not possible
3538600 the issue is clear current regeneration policies are failing the very people they are supposed to be helping
3538601 there is no evidence that the trend will be reversed without radical changes
3538602 it is sad to know that our ancestors played such a major role in the extinction of these species and sadder still when we consider that this trend continues today
3538603 are you open now to having a vote for offshore drilling
3538604 we will have a vote its not strictly on offshore drilling well have a vote on an array of initiatives that will protect the consumer that will increase the domestic supply and that will reverse global warming and among those may be some restricting drilling in protected areas if they can comply with the three criteria that i mentioned
3538605 absolutely not the gimmick that the republicans have come up with drill drill drill in the protected areas and it will bring down the price of oil is a complete misrepresneation to the american people there are plenty of places weve had to drill at 68 million acres in the lower 48 where people can drill more than 10 million acres in alaska which are permitted for drilling
3538606 just to line up the airlift sorties wouldve taken weeks
3538607 the hayes family is comfortable with dr kraus recommendation to not conduct an autopsy
3538608 adrian saw her with shia and that was kind of it the crash their hanging out he obviously didnt appreciate it
3538609 which releases on august 30th the track features none other than on the original
3538610 if this cat died naturally you wouldnt imagine they the owners would put it in a bowl containing water cover it with a towel and put kitchen gloves on it
3538611 and besides all that what we need is a decentralized distributed system of depositing electronic files to local libraries willing to host them
3538612 any major economic slowdown in the usa will have an effect here because it means those prospective buyers do not have as strong a financial position and may have fewer disposable assets to spend here
3538613 a problem has been detected and windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer
3538614 we found that some gifted and talented students are not engaged in learning because they dont see school as being relevant to them
3538615 the evidence shows that by providing special support programmes tailored to suit individual needs school becomes more relevant to these students
3538616 this report shows how teachers can extend the abilities and talents of gifted students
3538617 it is thought alcohol stimulates the striatum an area of the brain important in attraction
3538618 both groups imbibers and abstainers were tested again the following day and the men who had drunk alcohol still rated pictures of women higher
3538619 a problem has been detected and windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer
3538620 pelosi is committed to her global warming fanaticism to the point where she has said that shes just trying to save the planet
3538621 we all know that someone did that over 2 000 years ago they saved the planet we didnt need nancy pelosi to do that
3538622 i am well aware that some people have called on me and on the department to take even more drastic steps
3538623 where there is evidence of criminal wrongdoing we vigorously investigate it and where there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime we vigorously prosecute
3538624 but not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
3538625 in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
3538626 the most consistently brilliant science fiction writer in the world
3538627 dick sees all the sparkling and terrifying possibilities that other authors shy away from
3538628 it will take time to bring the laity on board with this proposal
3538629 there is no proposal under consideration either publicly or privately for the episcopal diocese of fort worth to become part of the roman catholic church
3538630 does not change on a whim to suit the transient issues of the day
3538631 they want to be roman catholic and want the diocese to be catholic with them
3538632 church laws are very clear that a diocese is the people and their church properties and theres no way a diocese can withdraw
3538633 that can only be done by the general convention of the episcopal church
3538634 when you say full communion that means youre a catholic baptized with the sacraments the rights and responsibilities
3538635 retirement isnt the abrupt cliff edge it once was and for many of todays
3538636 with obama saying the hour is upon us to elect a black man and hillary saying the hour is upon us to elect a woman the democratic primary has become the ultimate nightmare of liberal identity politics all the victimizations go tripping over each other and colliding a competition of historical guilts people will have to choose which of americas sins are greater and which stain will have to be removed first is misogyny worse than racism or is racism worse than misogyny as it turns out making history is actually a way of being imprisoned by history its all about the past will americas racial past be expunged or americas sexist past be expunged
3538637 i cant help it but reading about such episodes of screaming gushing and swooning makes me wonder whether women i should say we women of course arent the weaker sex after all or even the stupid sex our brains permanently occluded by random emotions psychosomatic flailings and distraction by the superficial women are only children of a larger growth wrote the 18th century earl of chesterfield could he have been right
3538638 then theres clintons nearly all female staff chosen for loyalty rather than say brains or political savvy clinton finally fired her daytime soap watching self styled latina queena campaign manager patti solis doyle known for burning through campaign money and for her open contempt for the white boys in the clinton camp but stupidly she did it just in time to alienate the hispanic voters she now desperately needs to win in texas or ohio to have any shot at the democratic nomination
3538639 i swear no man watches greys anatomy unless his girlfriend forces him to no man bakes cookies for his dog no man feels blue and takes off work to spend the day in bed with a copy of the friday night knitting club no man contracts nebulous diseases whose existence is disputed by many if not all doctors such as morgellons where you feel bugs crawling around under your skin at least no man i know of course not all women do these things either although enough do to make one wonder whether there isnt some genetic aspect of the female brain something evolutionarily connected to the fact that we live longer than men or go through childbirth that turns the pre frontal cortex into cream of wheat
3538640 martyr or moron he dared to question feminisms big lie

3538643 the victim who was alone in his car stopped at a red light at that intersection he was approached by the suspect who got out of another vehicle also at that intersection the suspect then proceeded to stab the victim
3538644 never can fully understand that their little piece of the puzzle can sometimes complete the picture for us in an investigation
3538645 i think the guy calls em as he sees em and as president would call em as he sees em and would make people mad all over the place because it wouldnt fit anybodys playbook
3538646 feel comfortable with both of them in there as president
3538647 hes a great guy to fight an uphill battle with legislatively he keeps his word i probably shouldnt be saying this stuff but to be honest about it it was one of the better professional experiences ive ever had in my life
3538648 yes he shows temper but he burns fast and he doesnt let it cloud his judgment he would not be a loose cannon in the oval office
3538649 its not like hes going to pick up the red phone in a rage
3538650 so he somehow managed to become the nominee of the republican party but we all know its not because he was somebody that was kissing up to the republican establishment to say the least
3538651 for audi safety and performance have always gone hand in hand our cars are engineered to offer the best not just in crash protection but in preventing traffic accidents altogether
3538652 with the launch of the audi q7 tdi clean diesel in 2009 american suv buyers will have even more options from which to choose for safety as well as fuel economy convenience and performance
3538653 del 1 a 1 en su art 10 sigue vigente se derog la convertibilidad empero la ley 25 561 ha mantenido inc lume la prohibici n de la posibilidad de reajustar las deudas en base a ndices inflacionarios
3538654 actualmente la responsabilidad que tienen las empresas es de car cter civil y lo que estamos haciendo es responsabilizar penalmente a los representantes legales de las mismas
3538655 inclusive la propuesta legislativa va m s all en el sentido de agravar en un 30 las penas cuando el conductor maneja un veh culo de transporte p blico en estado de ebriedad o cuando el mnibus no tiene seguro contra accidentes de tr nsito soat
3538656 my goal is to let republicans have a clear understanding that their right to vote should not be restricted by any party affiliation
3538657 amber come away from the door they can see you
3538658 he is fine you cant fight his battles for him
3538659 dude that is a technical foul nothing above the neck
3538660 will provide clarity and certainty to the consultation process under the endangered species act
3538661 i am deeply troubled by this proposed rule which gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3538662 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government this is not the type of legacy this interior department should be leaving for future generations
3538663 clearly thats a case of asking the fox to guard the chicken coop
3538664 a giant caution light that made federal agencies stop and think about the impacts of their actions
3538665 what the bush administration is telling those agencies is they dont have to think about those impacts anymore
3538666 we have to have the ability to put our efforts where theyre needed
3538667 this really says to the agencies this law belongs to all of us
3538668 because it is not possible to link the emissions to impacts on specific listed species such as polar bears
3538669 so we dont inadvertently have the endangered species act seen as a back door to climate change policy that was never ever intended
3538670 clarity on an issue that if it was left broad and ambiguous could be a serious problem for the home building industry here in california
3538671 for home builders clarity in the rules is always always helpful
3538672 encouragement from both sides of the aisle to see if we couldnt bring about steps that would make the endangered species act more effective
3538673 climate change will bring two new elements increased frequency and intensity and maybe new hazards to areas that have not experienced disasters
3538674 it doesnt matter whos emitting the green house gases everyone will feel the impact more so in vulnerable communities
3538675 cities need to understand that there are short term mid term and longer term actions that can and are being taken to build their resilience
3538676 are there any sexier shots of you will you do requests
3538677 it pushes us to do things we may not have thought we could do

3538681 in less than a week putin has redrawn the geopolitical map of the contested region between russia turkey and iran
3538682 this is not the russia of 93 or 94 a terribly weakened russia
3538683 the russians are now negotiating from a position of strength
3538684 weve been working on georgia for four years and weve failed everyones guilty but putin is playing his cards brilliantly he knows exactly what hes doing and the consequences are all negative
3538685 this was a proxy war not about south ossetia but about moscow drawing a red line for the west
3538686 they marched into georgia to challenge the west and the west was powerless were dealing with a new russia
3538687 russian soldiers have been in south ossetia and abkhazia for 15 years the outcome of the negotiations will probably be the entrenchment of the russian presence in both of the enclaves
3538688 what can have an impact on the russians without damaging us more than them
3538689 this is the first time ever that an american presidents request was rejected because france and germany stuck together
3538690 might have been viewed as a green light by russia for its attacks on georgia i urge the nato allies to revisit the decision
3538691 a country that has such problems and is led by a hot headed militant does not belong in nato
3538692 it could take the whole alliance hostage and start the third world war
3538693 the spectrum of views in the eu is very wide it ranges from cold warriors to appeasers
3538694 this is just another way hes making history and we want to be part of it
3538695 i was so nervous i dont know if i saw it really well but i think its a good likeness
3538696 they showed them yesterday and i looked at them online i was planning to buy them but never dreamed we would do this
3538697 presley place where the money will go we contribute to them every year
3538698 also i want that on display in my living room in a curio cabinet
3538699 in alaska the women cant breastfeed their baby because their diet is predominantly whale meat and whales have so much mercury in their bodies because of ocean pollution theyve been infected and the breast milk feeding their baby is actually highly toxic
3538700 to put herself in a position that a lot of people wouldnt put themselves in
3538701 there was the japanese culture is such that its one of the kindest most polite most welcoming cultures you can ever run across i think they did it to pretty much scare us from coming back
3538702 men it has been well said think in herds it will be seen that they go mad in herds while they only recover their senses slowly and one by one
3538703 im completely in favor of the separation of church and state my idea is that these two institutions screw us up enough on their own so both of them together is certain death

3538718 you know given how much we reinforce these numbers to ourselves its possible that the number in our head probably contributes to the reality of how we age and how soon we actually do die
3538719 jesus how much i got i got thirty five summers left
3538720 men it has been well said think in herds it will be seen that they go mad in herds while they only recover their senses slowly and one by one

3538722 sarkozy said at a press conference in the georgian capital anonymous
3538723 let us now embark upon this great journey into the stars to find whatever may await us
3538724 would be confirming in some respects a belief that i fear is gaining credence at home and abroad that our best years are behind us that we are turning inward reducing our defense commitments and voluntarily starting to give up our super power status and our desire to maintain world superiority
3538725 this agreement has been agreed to by both presidents saakashvili and also medvedev the russian president
3538726 these are temporary arrangements now but later it should be replaced by international process
3538727 this does set the scene for a ceasefire although we do know that there is still sporadic fighting going on
3538728 but the scene is there now for an effective ceasefire we welcome very much the good work of the european union led by the french president president sarkozy and also the good work of the organisation for security and cooperation in europe
3538729 we have credible reports of camps set up in vladikavkaz where people have heard of outside killings and of executions of innocent civilians there
3538730 and i have to pay attention to three days of tskhinvali that has been levelled
3538731 hi jane this is bob my friend mary knows someone named john who knows someone named edgar who knows someone name susan who knows someone name peggysue who would really like to meet with you
3538732 this is not protest against land transfer in fact this is anger against india
3538733 i see this will have a bad impact and considering that pakistan is going through a bad turmoil now the overall impact on the peace process will not be very positive
3538734 such statements by leaders of a foreign country do not help the situation nor do they contribute to creating the atmosphere necessary for the dialogue process between india and pakistan to move forward
3538735 i condemn this terrorist attack that targeted us and this is not the first attempt
3538736 it is not going to sway us from continuing our course of imposing security through operation good omen
3538737 can be cloned and manipulated in minutes and accepted as genuine by the computer software recommended for use at international airports
3538738 cmon kids stick the skewer into the boil win a prize
3538739 my understanding is it has been reported that there was a firearm
3538740 the information we have doesnt confirm that but there will be a post mortem today which will give us a clearer picture of the cause of death and the type of injury that were looking at
3538741 i can see it and we put the money in so why cant you do something to get it
3538742 im hoping to get more treatment and be back in there tomorrow
3538743 i saw him when i walked in and he was pretty sore and said he thought could get loose
3538744 i walked back there a little later and he was still fighting it pretty good so theres no sense in pushing it
3538745 it gets you out of every day camp feel i think it will be exciting to go out there and prove we are capable of competing against another football team
3538746 have good weather you can practice longer practice more efficiently
3538747 i think the players the frame of mind they are in is better
3538748 this has been a great place and if were going to come back i would be more than happy
3538749 were looking forward to going to denver we had great work with them last year
3538750 that opportunity again to go against another team during training camp i think it is going to be a really good experience for us
3538751 those orientals has no clue oriental refers to objects not people are hard to understand
3538752 that dude is rocking way harder than he really should be
3538753 tim minchin was the winner that year where is he now
3538754 an ill advised attempt to engage the audience where he challenges scots in the audience to better his scottish accent

3538815 the trust sat down and identified the five top it projects it wished to implement this year and electronic discharge summaries were in the top five
3538816 the system is a web browser application which interfaces with the pas at the point of admission to hospital an alert is sent to a patients gp requesting information about their medication so the gp is aware that their patient is at the hospital
3538817 when the patient is discharged on the pas an electronic discharge summary is created this is linked to pharmacy to ensure that all information regarding medication and reasons for discontinuing medications are recorded
3538818 an email is then sent back to the gp alerting them that there is a discharge summary available they can view this summary via fusion
3538819 there is a team of in house it developers who have enhanced fusion to provide timely legible information about each patients care for gps
3538820 the second stage is due to commence at some stage before 1 january 2009 and the plan is to use fusion to create a template to capture the data this will be basic at first free text moving to using codes maybe at a later date

3538831 i think its 84 days from now that the people of america are going to choose their next president and its a big choice because we know these are tough times at home economically and dangerous times in the world and in my opinion the choice could not be more clear between one candidate john mccain who has experience and has been tested in war and tried in peace and another candidate that has not between one candidate john mccain who has always put his country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate that has not between one candidate thats a talker and one candidate whos the leader america needs as our next president you never know we never know what crisis will occur in the four years of his watch weve just seen over the last few days as the russians invaded a sovereign nation georgia and watch the response of this man john mccain to that crisis right strong clear principled the kind of president we need in the white house over the next four years to protect our country our security and our freedom

3538841 however the performance of this sophisticated diagnostic tool depends in great part on the quality of the rf shielding provided
3538842 there is no shielding system on the market which outperforms sdis in fact our system was originally developed to meet the most stringent requirements of mri magnet manufacturers no wonder sdi is the shielding most often specified by these oems
3538843 the need for mris is increasing and the complexity is being increased
3538844 there is a huge demand for healthcare and there are a lot of projects but were also dealing with low cost labour issues
3538845 the way we respond to that is providing a lot of expertise and knowledge we provide added value we sell our projects not on proce but on quality and service
3538846 we will sustain that based on philosophies that we believe in and the emerging markets

3538850 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3538851 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3538852 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3538853 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3538854 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

3538856 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3538857 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3538858 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3538868 its bad enough that we face the end of america sadly we also face the end of humanity
3538869 what is wrong with us where is our passionate intensity
3538870 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3538871 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3538921 our customers will likely notice some of our sites will run out of gasoline temporarily gasoline is still being delivered but there will be for petro canada customers an inconvenience factor
3538922 the gasoline will be available at other petro canada sites it just might not be available where you normally fill up

3538935 would be confirming in some respects a belief that i fear is gaining credence at home and abroad that our best years are behind us that we are turning inward reducing our defense commitments and voluntarily starting to give up our super power status and our desire to maintain world superiority

3538937 i believe that jim leach sees barack obama as a candidate who is following in his footsteps one that is working to change the way business is done in washington by putting aside party affiliations and ending the era of negative partisan attacks in order to finally address the needs and priorities of hardworking americans
3538938 i know this is what inspired me to support barack obama for president
3538939 hes about the most honest and insightful person i know in politics
3538940 you can have a difference of opinion and be allowed to voice that

3538943 were operating a new system that is paying about 90 000 people
3538944 ultimately it is the general assembly that will decide whether to appropriate sufficient funds to those agenda to allow them to make the required payments without disrupting their ongoing operations
3538945 theres not another 700 million out there to pay this without reductions in the education budget

3538947 amberly first of all i think vocally it was a really strong performance i think that while you didnt do a lot to the song in terms of trying to make it your own it was basically the arrangement that feist does you did a really good job of it
3538948 i think that performance is a really interesting thing kind of study because from my perspective its probably the truest and best youve done but what it says to me the way i really see you as an artist is that youre kind of in this rufus wainwright kind of cool vibe eclectic kind of unique person and i wonder whether canadas ready to embrace that as an idol
3538949 mitch i really thought that was a really comfortable performance that you took ownership of that song i hadnt heard it before either but what i really appreciated was the honesty with which you sang it and you look great tonight by the way that was a really smart song selection
3538950 earl i was in the studio when that song was recorded ive probably seen it performed live i dont know 5 000 times i will tell you its very hard to do a song by the tragically hip because gords phrasing is a certain way and his voice sounds a certain way and very rarely have i seen anybody actually re invent a hip song until tonight
3538951 i dont disagree with that there was just a couple of lines where you were cutting it off a little too short but when you got to that soft part oh my god that was the money
3538952 first of all thank you for bringing turntables to the canadian idol stage i feel gratification for that also dude youre just unbelievably charismatic everything you touch youre a star youve just got to choose which galaxy you want
3538953 in a way you can kind of see yourself even though we came from a different world but it was cool to see the dream that they have because i think when we started out playing in bands and all that we had the same dreams to tour and make records so its kind of cool to see how optimistic they are about what they can achieve and all that
3538954 theyre all very very nice people super talented they all can sing really well and most of them can play an instrument as well
3538955 we didnt really know how they were going to integrate us into the show were like how is this going to work is it going to be awkward or a little bit weird but as soon as the first guy went through earl we were like this is going to be easy this is fun we can just relax and enjoy the show and watch these people that are super talented do their thing and just give our comments
3538956 the big thing too was dont forget to be yourself at some point the show will push you in different directions but at the same time you need to know who you are as an artist and its hard for them because theyre just getting started but its important to know that and just sort of stick to it
3538957 a man never discloses his own character so clearly as when he describes another

3538961 some people mistakenly think that a gentle and quiet spirit is displayed when a woman never speaks this has concerned some of the outgoing personalities because they dont know how to be a silent lump this is merely looking at externals certainly sometimes a quiet spirit will be exhibited by silence but not always and a quiet person can be all worked up on the inside this is missing the point a heart that is resting in the faithfulness of god is gentle and quiet it is not stirred up with worry and anxiety this gentle and quiet spirit is a calm peaceful spirit it is a tame spirit a gentled spirit i have often compared this kind of spirit to a glassy lake not turbulent or troubled but hardly showing a ripple in contrast the anxious spirit is like a stormy sea with whitecaps whipping along the shore this of course brings to mind our lord calming the troubled sea of galilee likewise he can calm our troubled spirits when we look to him
3538962 lord help us to be the women you want us to be help to grow and cultivate that gentle and quiet spirit that you desire for us to have and to show true beauty to the world not the counterfeit beauty that the world has to offer that fades away may it be a light to all people so they will know who you are help us repent of a wrong spirit and convict us when we off course you are mighty and we are thankful for your mighty hand in our lives and we ask this in your sons holy name jesus christ amen

3538973 she brings him good and not harm all the days of her life
3538974 deep down however we know that our generation has eaten its seed corn we lack the discipline and the vision to deny ourselves in the hope of something enduring and worthy for our posterity we are tired from working extra jobs and the looming depression threatens our 401k s credit cards are nearly maxed and it costs a 100 to fuel the suburban now the kid is raising hell again demanding the latest play station as his price for doing his school work and there goes that modest young woman in the home made dress with her four bright eyed well behaved home schooled children in tow wouldn t you just love to wipe that serene look right off her smug face
3538975 this operation pre dates project wickenby but it is another example of how the afp in concert with its project wickenby partners continues to focus on arrangements involving offshore secrecy havens and money laundering to ensure those involved pay their fair share of tax
3538976 as part of the response to the wheeler review into airport security and policing customs cctv capacity has been vastly improved with the recent installation of the last of over 200 cameras
3538977 the review recommended they be installed to remove black spots in the airside and baggage make up areas of airports
3538978 customs has also established an airports national monitoring and analysis centre anmac located in melbourne where customs officers remotely monitor and record airport cctv camera feeds from brisbane sydney and melbourne airports 24 hours a day seven days a week
3538979 airport security is critically important and the government will continue to review and upgrade it as required
3538980 these are substantial achievements and are part of a whole range of projects being undertaken by customs to improve cctv coverage security and functionality at our international airports
3538981 i congratulate customs for meeting the deadline for installing these new cctv cameras all of these projects are on time and on budget
3538982 the australian government and the australian federal police afp have invested heavily in supporting law enforcement agencies to succeed and adapt to the evolving security challenges in south east asia
3538983 this program will develop a group of senior police officers who will be able to share their knowledge with their counterparts in other regional police forces
3538984 the centre has also provided courses in subjects as diverse as islamic law and politics security risk management and disaster victim identification

3538987 ug99 first occurred in uganda in 1999 its now in iran and closing in on asia
3538988 most crops in asias major wheat growing areas are vulnerable to ug99 so if it gets to these areas food shortages and famine could result ug99 could also pose a bio security threat to australia
3538989 wheat varieties worldwide including those in australia rely on only a few rust resistance genes to protect them from different strains of rust but most of these resistance genes provide little protection against ug99 and derived strains
3538990 participating in a co ordinated international consortium is the best way to find solutions to this potential global threat
3538991 the challenge is to now identify and deploy more multiple resistance gene combinations that protect wheat against ug99 or find other ways to protect wheat from this fungus
3538992 participating in a co ordinated international consortium is the best way to find solutions to this potential global threat
3538993 they have made it possible for us to observe large areas of the ocean under the sea ice in winter for the first time
3538994 conventional oceanographic platforms cannot provide observations under the sea ice particularly on the antarctic continental shelf where the most important water mass transformations take place until now our ability to represent the high latitude oceans and sea ice in oceanographic and climate models has suffered as a result
3538995 they have made it possible for us to observe large areas of the ocean under the sea ice in winter for the first time
3538996 by providing ocean measurements under the sea ice the seals are helping us to establish the global ocean observing system we need to detect and understand changes in the ocean
3538997 for the past 2 years the riaa and its attack dog safenet formerly known as mediasentry have been trying to avoid disclosure in umg v
3538998 the rirdc rural womens award has opened up a network of influential people and supportive women and opened my mind to new horizons and future opportunities in primary industries
3538999 the entire award process has opened my mind to new horizons and future opportunities in primary industries it has been a steep learning curve at times but the experience gained and the opportunity to learn new skills and knowledge and network with people of influence and with like minded women should not be missed i would encourage all rural women to enter not only for the bursary but for their own personal and professional development and the exposure to others experiences in primary industries
3539000 international roaming charges are the subject of complaints where prices are high making it very expensive to make mobile phone calls while overseas this issue deserves attention particularly as mobile data services grow and businesses come to rely even more on cross border access

3539007 the rain was good it held up for us so that was good we got something accomplished i though we turned the ball over a lot today on offense the ball was on the ground a lot today good defense not good offense
3539008 yeah he made some plays hes that kind of player you know hes a sudden kind of player hes got pretty good ball skills good instincts hes a good tackler that kind of thing
3539009 we know what hes capable of doing were going to continue to look at our guys ks connor barth and nick novak were going to let these guys kick now last week we scored some touchdowns and ill always take touchdowns over field goals but we have to wait and see nothing is out of the realm of trying to get better we know hes a veteran kicker right now were letting these two guys compete and well see what happens
3539010 theyve been pretty good the guys that got hurt are coming back dt glenn dorsey came back and practiced a little bit today that was good to see i think theyve done a good job theyre starting to understand whats expected of them theyre practicing well so well see now theyve got to go play again its another week
3539011 yeah we dont want to rush him theres no need to rush him weve got two more preseason games after this one hell be ready to play
3539012 well see he could be but im cautious if i feel that a guy isnt 100 percent especially a young guy theres no need to put them out there
3539013 he strained his hamstring so well see about that he said it cramped up on him
3539014 i want those hurt guys to get well thats a problem because if you go into preseason games with hurt linebackers and then those poor guys have to play special teams and by the third quarter everybodys worn out so hopefully we can get some bodies back you know lb donnie edwards is not ready and napo lb napoleon harris so thats two guys gone
3539015 yeah thats a saving grace right there because then we really would have been short
3539016 hes competing to be there so well see what happens there are a lot of things that are going to happen between now and when the season starts
3539017 theyre doing pretty good they really are theyre starting to understand and feel comfortable in it youve just got to keep playing and getting better thats our whole key is just try to get better every day
3539018 t brandons albert not in there i think when he comes back thats going to help but the rest of those guys are going to practice together herbie t herb taylor is doing a good job over at the left tackle position so theyre better theyre a lot better than they were in the spring but weve still got a long way to go theres a lot of things we still have to improve on
3539019 how many aboriginal children there how many poor children there

3539021 the operation involved the commitment of more than 400 afp members and demonstrates the dedication and patience of the afp in ensuring a positive result for the australian community
3539022 investigations like this one that include targeting the illegal financing of organised criminal syndicates involved in the global trade in illicit drugs are proving highly successful and ensure an economic as well as social return for the community
3539023 this is an extraordinary outcome for law enforcement as it continues to work together to detect illicit drugs before they reach australia international intelligence combined with the cooperation of local law enforcement agencies played a big role in the success of the operation
3539024 customs and its law enforcement partners are working hard to stop shipments like these from reaching australian streets
3539025 this particular detection highlights the excellent work done by our targeters and analysts to identify this shipment and the skilful use of x ray technology

3539028 in terms of the conservative constituency of the republican party sen mccain is an opportunistic infection that threatens to ravage and destroy its defenseless body tragically for america in the larger context of our national political life he still plays the role of the aids virus masquerading as a republican while opening the way for barack obama the opportunistic infection that will ravage the defenseless body of our republic
3539029 jeffrey owens and geno atkins didnt play a lot but when they did they dominated

3539031 trinton was bigger stronger and more experienced than he was a year ago
3539032 we would have probably had 30 to 40 people there at all times the kids love it they love doing the volunteer work they love doing the community involvement
3539033 what were doing doesnt involve whether or not you make the team
3539034 its not a requirement for the swimmers its strictly volunteer we feel its unfortunate the kids are going to miss out on being able to do what they like to do
3539035 weve had to send out waivers two consecutive years to the mpa to try and allow our field hockey team to man a booth at the balloon festival they had granted it in the past but the last time we did it they said it would be the last time
3539036 its unique to our area i think we should be able to send specific teams for this one weekend to fundraise
3539037 were going to make the best of the situation and hope that we do as well as we did last year
3539038 under an agreement drawn up through the sadi program broens industries has committed to upskilling a total of 80 staff over the next three years
3539039 broens industries is a sydney based small to medium sized enterprise sme delivering precision engineering toolmaking automation solutions and special purpose machinery across a broad range of industries including automotive marine mining pharmaceutical and now the aerospace and defence sectors

3539047 were looking at a lot of plans right now a lot is changing in the industry
3539048 we did go apply for a tax credit to support a third shift that would make sense what does happen would potentially be in the fourth quarter of this year
3539049 basically we are going to receive 20 million from the state and all we have to do is come up with 6 million and we will receive two brand new elementary buildings
3539050 if we dont take advantage of this opportunity in two three 10 years we are going to have to make major improvements to our elementary schools
3539051 those major improvements will be well over the 6 million that we are asking voters to approve

3539058 australia recognises the need to embrace clean energy and technology as the major platform for our abatement efforts
3539059 the rapidly growing overseas markets for clean energy and renewable energy technologies and services like that in china offers greater scale than is possible in australia alone and presents a major opportunity for our exporters
3539060 guangdong is one of chinas wealthiest provinces and also one of the largest emitters of carbon in china
3539061 there is a great opportunity for australian providers of environmental technologies to take an active role in assisting guangdong move towards a more energy efficient economy
3539062 australias exports of lng to southern china already make an important contribution to lowering emissions from power generation in this region
3539063 through activities such as this seminar australian companies can strengthen existing relationships with the key players in the southern china energy sector and hopefully create new linkages
3539064 the joint efforts to introduce australian clean energy technology in southern china will build upon the commitment reaffirmed during prime minister rudds visit to beijing in april and again this week for both australia and china to hold annual meetings at ministerial level to strengthen our cooperation on climate change

3539072 the government is committed to working closely with northern jurisdictions including local government as well as business and communities to achieve the best possible outcomes for northern australia
3539073 talking directly to people in the northern territory gives me a greater understanding of the critical issues and challenges they are currently facing
3539074 these meetings will help guide the office of northern australias future priorities and inform future regional policy development
3539075 the streets of adelaide are much safer without these goods
3539076 their seizure the customs investigation into the circumstances of their importation and successful prosecution of the person involved reflects the ability of customs to pursue the importation of dangerous goods right through from their overseas source to their interception at the australian border and their subsequent destination

3539078 private keller is focused on recovering from his injuries and getting back to work

3539086 oh no too dark again quick give his alter ego a puppy
3539087 ok now we have to make him refer to himself in the plural like the comics with the split personality between eddie and venom
3539088 argh too dark again give him a love interest who tries to save him from the insanity but ends up dying before the end of the movie
3539089 or theyll probably make him pink and shoot flower coated puppies out of his anus as he travels the galaxy bringing happiness and free rainbows to everyone
3539090 people dont want unwavering deciders who stick to something even if it kills them they want sound and more importantly up to date judgment based on accurate information

3539100 we had a solid second quarter with a substantial improvement in cash used by operations and an improved gross margin the margin improvements were principally due to price increases realized in the market and the 63 increase in volume throughput at the richmond terminal during the quarter which were tempered by increasing fuel costs in shipping our sales contracts allow for the recovery of these increased fuel costs during the following year and there is therefore a timing delay in the recovery of these expenses
3539101 our strong growth continued despite the slowdown in construction activity in california we sold 500 000 tons of sand and gravel in the second quarter bringing our sales total for the first two quarters to 1 02 million tons third quarter sales have been strong and we will ship more than 700 000 tons during the period we anticipate shipping between 2 1 to 2 5 million tons in 2008 an increase of approximately 100 percent over 2007 shipments at the mid point of this range our previously announced acquisition of the pier b land in the port of long beach in collaboration with our strategic alliance partner is due to close on or about august 18th and will create a strategic point of entry into the massive los angeles metropolitan area market beginning early in 2011 we are increasingly well positioned to benefit from the ongoing depletion of indigenous aggregate sources in california and the eventual increase in demand generated by infrastructure commercial and residential construction activity
3539102 the earnings growth we have reported for both the second quarter and the first half was the result of worldwide increases in fertilizer prices as well as solid demand growth and sales volumes that were higher than we originally expected in our iodine and lithium businesses
3539103 margins on our specialty plant nutrients have risen considerably as a result of favorable pricing conditions together with our strategy of targeting markets that deliver the highest returns however rising costs continue to have an impact mainly due to higher energy costs on balance we are optimistic about the outlook for the second half of 2008 and our efforts are focused on achieving third and fourth quarter results that surpass the second quarter results we have just reported
3539104 the results of this survey will help in research and education and be of benefit to the ict industry and consumers in new zealand
3539105 it is very useful to have meaningful statistical information where previously only opinion and anecdote existed the value of the information will increase even further as more data is collected each year
3539106 we will be able to see how new zealanders use of the internet compares to other countries which will be vital input into policy decision making
3539107 im really excited that daniel will get to see him
3539108 hes been gone since march and he has talked to me every hour that he could but for him to be able to see us to see that were all right and healthy is really nice

3539115 a lot of people only put enough petrol in here if theyre travelling to adelaide to get to port pirie and fill up in port pirie
3539116 we were very pleased with the overall financial performance of our businesses in the second quarter both of our operating segments contributed to the growth last quarter this despite the well publicized economic challenges that persist in the market and a 6 9 percent decline in oil and gas drilling activity in western canada year over year our improved results can be attributed to a few fundamental factors first of all our business units continued to perform well with demand remaining strong in several markets second we added two established companies to our group over the past year r e line trucking and pro north oilfield services third our rates and pricing structure were adjusted to reflect the 40 0 percent yearly increase in fuel cost lastly we were able to realize on our efforts and initiatives to control and manage our costs for example we realized a 1 9 million decrease in our selling and administrative expenses at a time when our revenue was increasing by over 30 0 million as a result of all these factors both segments increased their operating margins and the funds overall operating margin improved from 11 3 percent in 2007 to 13 9 percent in 2008
3539117 its a huge wetlands system that you know once upon a time was a haven for bird species and still is in terms of the bird species that are hanging on
3539118 but if we are to essentially cut this area off from the rest of the river thats going to come at a very high price i think for the bird populations in the area
3539119 he saw issues in black and white and he was a real battler for his constituents
3539120 it didnt matter whether he had to take on his own government or whoever if he believed in a cause for his constituents that was his first loyalty

3539136 it was just holding me to the ground and it pushed my teeth right into the rock then my dad pulled him off and i ran again and tripped and he started tackling me
3539137 excessive speculation in any commodity under contrasts of sale of such commodities for future deliver causing sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in the prices of such commodity is an undue and unnecessary burden on interstate commerce in such commodity
3539138 as the commission finds are necessary to diminish eliminate or prevent such burden
3539139 although dedicated mobile apps are not yet good enough to win in their own right it was striking how many of this years winners have a mobile component mobile is definitively the trend to watch for next year and any application owner should think hard about whether and how to add mobile features in 2009
3539140 increased alcohol outcomes among reserve guard personnel deployed with combat exposures is concerning in light of increased reliance on these forces
3539141 active duty marines were also found to be at increased odds of continuing to binge drink after deployment as well as to experience new onset alcohol related problems
3539142 women were significantly more likely to start drinking heavily but less likely to start binge drinking or have alcohol related problems compared with men which may be due to women turning to drinking as a coping mechanism whereas men may have a higher propensity for risk taking behaviors
3539143 we are not outside the milf we are milf and are not a lost command
3539144 but if we were hit first thats another matter thats already a standing order and it means fighting
3539145 i often talk to eid kabalu he knows our disposition and we follow the standing order
3539146 they should do the final signing one word is enough for a wise man wheres justice it is they who did not keep their word
3539147 theres no need for a clearance from our chair in the milf if we are the ones being pummeled its fighting at once
3539148 of course we have to fight because that was the standing order
3539149 i have no child who was killed in the fighting the only child i lost was when it was still in the womb of my wife
3539150 on the issue of what to do with kato for committing acts of violence the philippine national police pnp was preparing for the filing of specific charges for the illegal acts he committed
3539151 we are in the process of strengthening our evidence so we could file charges against kato on the criminal acts he has committed during the past few days we will file charges and we are hoping that warrant of arrest would be issued
3539152 you want people to think well of you dont you
3539153 hopefully we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull

3539169 nations do not mistrust each other because they are armed they are armed because they mistrust each other
3539170 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3539171 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3539172 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3539173 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3539174 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3539175 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3539176 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3539177 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3539178 its really a validation of where weve been able to take our wireless operations
3539179 its really a validation of where weve been able to take our wireless operations
3539180 and the trouble is if you dont risk anything you risk even more
3539181 my hope is that these settlements will help the survivors and their families begin to heal and move forward
3539182 i apologize again today to the survivors and their families and to the whole catholic community we must continue to do everything in our power to ensure the safety of the children in our care
3539183 sometimes we forget about them the rebels every day they say they are fighting for the poor people of darfur and yet what have they done to show even interest to go to the conference table
3539184 i am not in any way saying that the khartoum government is clean but what i am saying is that also the other side cannot be said to be saints so my appeal is that the pressure should be exerted on both sides
3539185 they will have to end on a negotiation table because militarily its clear no side can win the war in darfur
3539186 but if you have 15 20 parties wanting to go to conference table to talk nothing will come out of it
3539187 unfortunately we are sent to the boxing ring with our hands tied behind us
3539188 but we will try kickboxing if we cant do hand boxing
3539189 a deal has been reached between president mugabe and mdc mutambara faction which has been signed in the presence of president mbeki
3539190 negotiators are meeting right now trying to find the technical details of how the new government will be structured
3539191 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3539192 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3539193 there is a text it has been accepted in moscow it was accepted here in georgia i have the agreement of all the protagonists
3539194 the territorial integrity and belonging of south ossetia and abkhazia to georgia can never be put under doubt
3539195 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace
3539196 those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3539197 you have the right to freedom and independence we are here to demonstrate our solidarity freedom is worth fighting for
3539198 this country russia seeks to restore its dominance but the time of dominance is over
3539199 our visit is a sign of the solidarity of our five countries with the georgian nation which has been a victim of aggression
3539200 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3539201 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3539202 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3539203 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3539204 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3539205 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3539206 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3539207 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3539208 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3539209 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3539210 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3539211 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3539212 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3539213 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3539214 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3539215 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3539216 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3539217 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3539218 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3539219 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3539220 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3539221 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3539222 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3539223 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3539224 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3539225 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3539226 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3539227 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3539228 businesses have shorted the let me express some outrage on the part of small business owners we do your dirty work for you the federal government
3539229 she has given us statements that are similar to what she told reporters
3539230 not the optimal way to do business but really the only way
3539231 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3539232 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3539233 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3539234 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3539235 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3539236 im not lucid right now im saying funny things give me a half hour and ill talk
3539237 everything has been done out in the open i have a reputation i do not want the fans of cleveland or honest caring people to think that i cheated
3539238 we are committed to working with fda to make sure physicians understand this information
3539239 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3539240 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3539241 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3539242 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3539243 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3539244 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3539245 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3539246 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3539247 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3539248 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3539249 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3539250 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3539251 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3539252 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3539253 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3539254 men i senaste numret intervjuas socialdemokraternas partiledare mona sahlin och d g r b de d skalle och m sterligt upp i brygga varf r jo mona sahlin gillar ju bruce springsteen jag kan bara anta att n jesguidens redaktion r m ttligt intresserad av v ra politiker f r det finns verkligen ingen anledning l ngre att bli imponerad av att en politiker gillar popul rkultur i sj lva verket b r man m jligen f rv nas ver att sahlin inte kommit l ngre i sin musikaliska utveckling
3539255 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3539256 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3539257 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3539258 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3539259 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3539260 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3539261 it has to be something i cant do without them
3539262 itll be one of the things were going to finish up on this session
3539263 yeah but the fact is were going to continue the effort
3539264 we havent shot the ball well from the outside since weve been here
3539265 i think were taking shots that these guys can hit and we still score 100 points but if we start hitting 3s we are going to be a lot better youre always better when you score hitting shots i like the fact that we havent really gotten hot yet and it hasnt affected the intensity of our defense i think it says a lot for the character of our guys
3539266 where i ve been istanbul turkey mundy mundy i tripadvisor acquires facebook app where i ve been for 3 million
3539267 where weve been around the world and found some awesome sponsors sponsors
3539268 when youre out in front first you get to define the territory and cbs was amazingly successful with that
3539269 but when youre top dog its almost as if theres nowhere to go but down
3539270 if that were on animal planet it would have been the biggest thing theyve ever seen
3539271 but its all economies of scale and cbs needs a much larger bang if its going to invest its buck
3539272 the philosophy at cbs with regards to reality tv is actually a sound one
3539273 its the kind of philosophy that every now and again brings you a survivor or an amazing race
3539274 utrzymana w konwencji gier z kategorii tycoon tyle e z akcentem po o onym na zr wnowa ony rozw j w warunkach wolnorynkowej konkurencji
3539275 this committee will carry out the investigation in a quick manner and will as much as possible finish it by this fall
3539276 in the end we decided unanimously to accept the present composition
3539277 ultimately the appointment of a supreme court justice is a function of the executive
3539278 weve put this process in place and we have the right to name some individuals were not providing a veto to the bloc or the ndp on these things
3539279 overt discouragement of attendance of a witness whos been summoned would constitute basis for contempt
3539280 would be a matter which should be or could be subject to its own investigation
3539281 thats what they told me they said you dont have to come
3539282 she said it but shes from the party she would contact whoever the executive director is those people would decide or doug finley the partys top political organizer hes the guy that would im sure all people would be spoken to yes
3539283 if thats part of a pattern then its some attempt to steer if not to interfere with the witnesses i resent it
3539284 mr lowery is a standup guy hes telling the truth i think theyre digging themselves into a deep deep hole everything the conservatives are doing has the stink of desperation all over it
3539285 i enjoyed our conversation last time it was a conversation i will not forget any time soon
3539286 well i have two close female friends one is single the other is married and were going on 6 plus years now and i love sheila
3539287 most guys are pretty passive when it comes to lust not realizing theyve made many micro choices to get to lust and desire for sex but you really can enjoy someone as a close friend and choose not to go down that path
3539288 sex has not been on my radar screen in my friendships
3539289 it makes all the difference in the world if you wisely and gently include your spouse in the front part of the friendship in order to build a communal trust between each other two christmases ago sheila bought me a christmas gift to go see u2 in concert with my single friend just the two of us
3539290 they know sheila they love sheila and sheila loves them both
3539291 you have to be careful about emotional bonding with another woman
3539292 millions of married women have very deep emotional bonds with their same sex friends and think nothing of it i share deep emotional bonds with both of my female friends we are pretty close but i still delight in and love my wife and she knows she is my wife and my two friends are my two close friends i have positive emotional intensity towards both of my female friends but it hasnt threatened my marriage or my love for sheila one can be emotionally intense with a cross gender friend and not be caught up in emotional adultery those are two very different relational dynamics i would say that i have two intimate emotionally powerful friendships with these women going on 6 plus years and sheila not only enthusiastically supports them shes my biggest cheerleader in writing a book advocating that married christians can have intimate friendships with the other gender
3539293 heaven the essentiality of being where everything achieves its full authenticity is already close to us in friendship
3539294 few things are as healing and life giving as is friendship between woman and man man and woman
3539295 a man needs something which is more than friendship and yet is not love as it is generally understood this something nevertheless a woman only can give
3539296 few things are likelier to kill a friendship quicker than a careful and strictly adhered to theory of what qualities are needed in friend
3539297 i do not wish to treat friendships daintily but with the roughest courage when they are real they are not glass threads or frostwork but the solidest things we know
3539298 authentic friendship is notoriously different and inescapably risky true friendships are not relationships we control but adventures we enter into
3539299 it is more important who they are as people and only then it is important who they are as dancers
3539300 there is a love that does not desire to possess it is called friendship when friendship is the determining force in a relationship individuals are able to find themselves and a passion for life not merely lose themselves in love
3539301 in this kingdom the distinctions and barriers between male and female were to be broken down to actualize the potential of any love in this case a male and female love of friendship can be to participate in the building of a kingdom of love spiritual friendships shared by men and women can be eschatological signs
3539302 friendship forms friendship is a much underestimated aspect of spirituality its every bit as significant as prayer and fasting like the sacramental use of water and bread and wine friendship takes what is common in human experience and turns it into something holy
3539303 en 2006 nos vimos obligados a reconocer los resultados de una elecci n fraudulenta
3539304 nosotros advertimos indic que esos se alamientos no son una declaraci n aislada sino una acci n debidamente planeada y concertada desde el gobierno
3539305 cobra por adelantado el servicio de sacar las iniciativas del ejecutivo
3539306 es un peligro para m xico y que si el pri vuelve a la presidencia con el pri sta a la cabeza retornar al gobierno el pri smo autoritario y represor
3539307 esta embestida contra beltrones y el pri se deton a partir de la llegada de gustavo madero como coordinador de los senadores del pan y sus se alamientos de que en unos d as habr a periodo extraordinario para sacar la reforma petrolera y que lograr a obtener los votos que le falten en el pri compr ndolos luego viene el espionaje contra el congreso de la uni n y por ltimo las declaraciones de espino
3539308 sin embargo la extrema derecha enferma esa facci n del pan los ultras que le disputan el gobierno y la conducci n del pa s a calder n espera ser una aplanadora en ambas c maras y no entiende ni entendi que es una minor a en el congreso y esa versi n de espino de que el pri y su coordinador en el senado reciben privilegios no justificados son se alamientos surgidos de la intolerancia
3539309 s tuvimos una serie de negociaciones complejas para la instalaci n de la actual legislatura y fue para que todos los partidos presidieran comisiones y no es m s lo que nos corresponde por el n mero de integrantes de las bancadas pero ellos los panistas esperaban que las comisiones estuvieran a su servicio y ahora dicen que tenemos m s comisiones producto de los acuerdos pero es falso
3539310 los acuerdos entre el legislativo y el ejecutivo se dan en la junta de coordinaci n pol tica y se expresan en el pleno el pri ha votado con sus principios y pan y prd han coincidido en diversos temas con nosotros pero esta campa a de descalificaci n tiene como objetivo principal desgastar la figura de beltrones porque el tricolor ha dicho muy claro que no habr periodo extraordinario para aprobar la reforma de pemex eso no lo admiten y empiezan los reclamos y acusaciones

3539318 mugabe wanted tsvangirai as a ceremonial prime minister there was never any serious intent by mugabe to give up power
3539319 there is no future for these talks unless the facilitator mbeki is able to come forward with proposals that demonstrate a change in mugabes position
3539320 the pressure only went one way on tsvangirai and he had no proposals to break the logjam
3539321 menos de f tbol me la paso hablando sobre cualquier otra cosa en su mayor a mentiras

3539326 standing features a sound that is like three days grace on sterroids
3539327 im not fully satisfied with the speed it could have been a little faster
3539328 its a bit slow i was expecting that it would be faster eight hours or so
3539329 we should make it shorter especially because its going to be used in the national elections in 2010 the faster the count the better for everyone
3539330 its double the percentage that we said would be good its excellent
3539331 hopefully we will be able to proclaim before 5 p m tomorrow
3539332 our people down there are eager to proclaim there appear to be clear winners already

3539357 entitlement to free prescriptions in england is based on the principle that those who can afford to contribute should do so while those who are likely to have difficulty in paying should be protected there are extensive exemption arrangements already in place

3539397 former congressman jim leach an iowa republican who as chair of the house banking committee investigated the whitewater scandal endorsed presumptive democratic presidential nominee sen
3539398 an awful lot of republicans are more than slightly disgruntled at the direction of the country more than slightly disappointed at the large deficits and at our foreign policy adventurism this is the first time i have ever endorsed a democrat but i think were at a juncture in our history that weve got to put the national interest ahead of the party interest

3539410 were at war over salary with tori i didnt know i was at war with tori im really bummed because i love tori and i was psyched tori was going to be on the show
3539411 i think she should definitely get paid as much as either of us is getting paid her father created the show it just seems wrong if thats the case i dont know what really happened because i havent talked to her i would like to talk to her
3539412 they didnt even get the numbers right so i dont know if its about the money either
3539413 ill try to butt my head in whenever i can and tell people what i think about it
3539414 i think its open to interpretation and thats the great thing
3539415 you know if i want to protest something because it offends me thats my right as an american and its also any artists right to say and do whatever they wanna do
3539416 when i heard about it i felt really hurt inside
3539417 i cannot believe a writer could write something like that its the not the way that we want to be portrayed we have feelings we dont like the word retard we are people
3539418 there were parts of the movie where i laughed but it seems to me that the movie tried really hard to go too far and then pull back on everything that was offensive except the issue of people with intellectual disabilities i just think ben stiller and the people involved in this movie just didnt think it was going to be offensive
3539419 no changes or cuts to the film will be made
3539420 if you want to pick on people as the old playground saying goes pick on people your own size
3539421 this population struggles too much with the basics to have to struggle against hollywood were sending a message that this hate speech is no longer acceptable
3539422 everyone has their own opinion of what i should do but i think that its my life
3539423 i know there might be wrong decisions that i make and there might be right decisions that i make but theyre decisions that i make for myself and i think the only decision i can make is to be 100 per cent supportive of myself and not doubt myself at all
3539424 i really dont know why michelle continues to do this
3539425 we have a major this week and if you cant qualify for a major i dont see any reason why you should play with the men we all have different agendas in life
3539426 i kind of feel sad for the guidance that she seems to not have in the right direction if she wants to be a golfer she should really concentrate on the being on the womens tour and dealing with them and learning to win
3539427 the comments i havent them or read them i dont really care actually
3539428 people will have their opinion about me and obviously a couple of various criticisms or compliments will come my way and i may hear about them or i may accidentally read about them but id rather them have opinions about me than not have opinions about me so thats just the way it is
3539429 i dont listen to them i listen to the people that are close to me and i respect
3539430 but in the end everything comes down to my decision
3539431 michelle is a very talented young athlete that has unbelievable potential
3539432 its unfortunate the way things have gone for michelle in the last little while but michelle is a talent we need that talent on our tour she brings a lot of people out to watch her
3539433 you know i hope for michelle that she can continue being a kid at stanford and ill be selfish to say a good and important part of our tour
3539434 the year was inconsistent ive kind of had my ups and downs but i feel my game has gotten better over the summer
3539435 i feel as though ive and i dont know really how to say it but ive just kind of learned how to be patient with myself and how to just try and accept things and try not to be as perfect and just enjoy the game again
3539436 i think its a well made picture but while its funny in spots its very english i dont think its broadly commercial it feels like a film that deserves a spirited release but not a wide one joel has an 800 screen deal which well honor but we might not be willing to spend the marketing money he wants us to
3539437 i guess im in a shocking state of equanimity the filmmakers have every right to do what they think is best in support of their movies but we have the right to do whats best for warner bros sometimes the pursuit of those interests results in a disagreement for now were preparing to release the film in october but i dont see it starting out on 800 screens if joel is thinking there is someone out there willing to spend twice as much money as were willing to im sure he will pursue that
3539438 and once again weve taken extra measures to ensure the move in process goes smoothly and reduce the stress on the students their families and the community
3539439 were proud of how city and community officials work together to make move in day as welcoming as possible to students and families from out of town
3539440 what will happen is police will direct students and their families as close to the residence halls and university apartments as possible where hotshots will help them unload and then theyll be directed to a parking place a few blocks away
3539441 keep in mind several thousand people are going to be moving in friday
3539442 we always say bring lots of patience and a good sense of humor
3539443 a nightmare is much more intense than a bad dream it can arouse feelings of fear horror and distress it replicates our deepest fears and can reflect the different types of stresses we face in our waking world
3539444 nightmarish thoughts such as losing your job being homeless falling and being chased are a manifestation of how much the credit crunch is affecting our daily lives and causing distressed sleep patterns
3539445 for example dreaming about being chased or falling is a reaction to the stresses we face in life the attacker or falling in the dream represents the emotion of fear and anxiety
3539446 its no wonder gordon brown and alistair darling are making a special appearance in our nightmares at the moment both symbolise the fears we are facing in todays economy
3539447 we know what niger steel stands for we are ready to renovate the company in partnership with the south east steel limited
3539448 service and computer industries uganda sci in partnership with bytes document solutions is offering a machine with a printer fax scanner and photocopy
3539449 the rapid growth of icts and related services has brought opportunities and challenges we must work together to respond to challenges and grasp opportunities to maximise the enormous potentials of icts
3539450 before re launching the partnership of bytes and service and computer industries we did an analysis of the brand xerox within the ugandan market to ensure that history of the brand collapse does not repeat itself
3539451 aliens calling signals detected from beyond solar system scientists in south africa have detected radio signals from beyond the solar system for the first time prompting a wave of excitement over who or what might have sent it the signal is the most significant of its kind since radio telescopes started operating in the 1960s
3539452 it should be noted that this is not an intelligent source i e it is not a source that could be considered as having been transmitted by alien intelligence furthermore it is certainly not a new discovery the electromagnetic radiation emanating from sagittarius a is well documented and an entirely natural phenomenon a similar signal although of a much larger magnitude would be received by simply pointing the telescope at the sun
3539453 the board of directors of forefront holdings believes that given the inability of the parties to obtain the required approvals by the chinese government termination of these arrangements is in the best interests of forefront forefront will continue to focus on providing market leading products and service to our customers with our collection of industry leading golf accessory brands with support from our primary lender and majority shareholder stanford international bank ltd
3539454 after carefully considering the advantages and disadvantages of continued registration including i the high financial costs associated with preparing and filing periodic reports and other filings with the sec in comparison to forefront s size ii the demands placed on management to comply with sec reporting obligations which detract from time available for overseeing the operation and growth of forefront iii the limited public trading volume of forefront s common stock and iv the concentrated nature of forefront s public float over 80 of which is beneficially owned by one party stanford international bank ltd the board of directors of forefront believes that deregistering is in the best interest of increasing long term stockholder value this action should result in accounting legal and administrative expense reductions and allow forefront s management to focus its attention efforts and resources on forefront s operations and revenue growth
3539455 i heard its incredibly insulting in the way it depicts the intellectually disabled
3539456 it continues to reinforce old attitudes of the disabled as being incapable and buffoon like and less than valued members of our society i thought we had come a little farther
3539457 were encouraging people not to support movies or publications that denigrate people with disabilities
3539458 our mission is to assure that the intellectually disabled are included in everyday life and accepted for their gifts and talents and not belittled for their lack of skills this film is just not funny
3539459 i think its open to interpretation and thats the great thing
3539460 you know if i want to protest something because it offends me thats my right as an american and its also any artists right to say and do whatever they wanna do
3539461 i am certain that most parents of mainstream classmates of children with developmental disabilities are as unaware as i was that this demeaning storyline is central to the plot of the movie
3539462 it sickens me that my son would probably have invited his girlfriend to see this movie had i not heard about the hateful messages throughout it
3539463 we have received an amazing amount of support from all over our nation for the wounded warrior workplace initiative democrats republicans and independents have made the straniere pledge this is a non partisan effort and the nationwide movement continues to spread every day
3539464 these brave men and women gave their best and now it is our time to return what we can to them and their families
3539465 being a veteran myself i feel we need to do everything we can to support our wounded soldiers
3539466 support for our nations veterans and active duty troops has been a paramount issue in my campaign so i salute bob stranieres initiative and gladly commit to implementing the pledge with regard to my congressional staff if the voters send me to d c
3539467 being someone who has had family in the military i support this initiative because the veterans are the ones who keep us being free
3539468 without question i support this great initiative and i have already hired a veteran on my staff
3539469 employers often find it difficult understanding how military experience translates into real world experience things like leadership loyalty perseverance and duty are often overlooked this pledge means more than just hiring wounded heroes its an initiative to educate employers about the benefits of hiring veterans
3539470 i understand what our veterans go through because i am a decorated iraq war veteran living and working with a disability thats why im proud to make this pledge
3539471 as a veteran i believe we should do everything possible to support all of our veterans
3539472 we can sleep safely at night thanks to what these brave men and women have done for our country
3539473 this initiative is a commendable effort to bring attention to veterans and their families
3539474 i greatly support the initiative and i have already employed veterans for my staff
3539475 i think this is an awesome idea and a great plan i fully support the initiative
3539476 bob straniere shows both leadership and compassion in his outspoken support of the wounded warrior workplace initiative this demonstrates his willingness to take action and not just issue feel good press releases bravo for bob
3539477 i can only hope the members of our congress will follow his lead
3539478 as a vietnam era veteran i take great pride in the actions taken by bob straniere bobs wounded warrior workplace initiative is exactly what i would expect from a fellow veteran and patriot our nation needs leaders like bob straniere leader that are willing to stand up for those who would sacrifice life and limb so that others can continue to enjoy the freedom and privileges our great nation provides
3539479 we are both committed to the same ideas and principles for council and the community while there will undoubtedly be other issues in the future on which we have different opinions we believe we can offer voters real leadership
3539480 we need to ensure a core change on council in both the mayoral position and that of councillors and to that end we are highlighting seven main points in our campaign
3539481 lifesaving services save lives and bring tourists to our area clubs are the backbone of our coastal communities and critical to the development of our young people
3539482 as in health care i understand that a healthy community is a strong community
3539483 what we bring to the community is a wealth of expertise
3539484 very few councillors we know of have the experience of running large business organisations
3539485 mayo before its merger with manning valley senior citizens homes was a business with around 300 employees greater taree city council has around 270
3539486 i think we offer a little bit more depth in management and experience in running large corporations such as a council
3539487 both of us have the advantage of understanding financial reports and management plans etc both of us have had a lot of achievements over the years
3539488 we dont believe for one moment that the problems greater taree city council faces will be resolved in 12 months the only way we will see a difference is to have a strength in councillors who are committed to bringing about a change for the better
3539489 the times editorial in that issue highlighted the need for change to come about starting within the organisation itself
3539490 it is quite obvious that councillors rely on council staff as with all heads of a business
3539491 there are exciting times ahead this is going to be a very interesting election
3539492 a great insight into the triple bottom line and gave equal treatment to the whole community
3539493 i will be relying on the electors to make their own choice when selecting their preferences although i will ultimately be issuing a how to vote once all candidates are known
3539494 my observation from my first term on council is that there is healthy debate and respect amongst the councillors in decision making without the factions and party politics that has plagued councils in other areas
3539495 they were a gift to us from ms oharris and as a benefactor i dont believe we should do this
3539496 we have kept them because we consider them a major treasure
3539497 feel free to look at and admire the seal but were asking people to give it some space
3539498 they can get quite aggressive when they have a newborn with them and they deliver a nasty bite
3539499 on the sand theyre pretty fast too they can move as fast as a human can run
3539500 the general rule is to keep at least 40 metres away at all times and 80 metres if the seal has a pup with it
3539501 i must admit ive never seen a seal at saltwater before
3539502 they were very subdued while they were listening i knew they wouldnt be able to come up with any questions afterwards
3539503 its such a bleak disturbing topic to teach to kids
3539504 but halinas was an uplifting story there was no self pity and no judgment of the people who treated her so badly
3539505 its the kind of values our kids need to be learning
3539506 mtc bought celtel 100 per cent we have the ambition to become a global brand and as part of going global we had the name change continentally hooked to each other by satellite today we have about 52 million subscribers and the plan is to hit 110 million by 2011
3539507 the arrest went very quietly he was handcuffed and led from the library by police
3539508 we have taken a joint decision to move the business based on the specific needs of the mtn sa business
3539509 i expect the public to apply strong pressure so that in a situation like olmerts a prime minister will no longer be able to continue his premiership
3539510 when facts are clear and in olmerts case there are more than a few facts that he himself does not contest a public figure must draw the conclusions
3539511 what happened in ramons case is terrible what is he complaining about the police have many authorities and means and i dont understand what the whole stir up around the wiretapping is all about
3539512 the court unanimously agreed that ramon gave a false testimony the judges rejected his claim saying the damage done to him was minimal
3539513 ramons quick return to the political arena is unacceptable he should have disappeared from the political stage for one or to years at the least
3539514 friedmann wrote accusation articles against the supreme court and especially against its president dorit beinish he published an article supporting ramon and all of a sudden becomes a minister of justice candidate where did his appointment originate from arent there enough professors worthy of receiving that legal title
3539515 i wouldnt say so my husband loves to come home
3539516 we slanted the news towards a withdrawal from lebanon because we had sons there
3539517 the morning audience stuck in traffic jams or at work is simply captive theyre ours
3539518 three broadcasters carmela menashe shelly yechimovich now a labor party knesset member ed and i pushed in every way possible the withdrawal from lebanon towards 2000 in our newsroom three of the editors had sons in lebanon and we took it upon ourselves as a mission possibly not stated to get the idf out of lebanon i have no doubt that we promoted an agenda of withdrawal that was a matter of public dispute
3539519 in my opinion that is just super problematic super problematic
3539520 correct im admitting it im not apologizing im just saying this is what happened it came from our guts because of the boys in lebanon this is what we did and im not sorry i am very proud that we had a part in getting of our sons out of lebanon
3539521 you determine the daily agenda and you have the power the problem is that in your profession it cant be dealt with properly and ethically without civil courage you have the power so use it also to ensure that there is freedom of speech of course with the limitation that you must act ethically and not create hostile public opinion because there is nothing that affects freedom of speech more than hostile public opinion
3539522 thank you for the applause we and the radio truly deserve it it is good that it is realized that in essence without us there is nothing
3539523 there is no doubt that the morning shows and what they broadcast determine the agenda of the rest of the day
3539524 we must not overestimate our influence we have an influence but it often lasts only until the next news show and often dont forget the politicians use us we fall victim to their spins it is also not true that we come in with a specific agenda to push we at least i come in with the goal of making a good show
3539525 as a diplomatic correspondent i was among those who in the past year were supposed to tell the public exactly what is the disengagement plan why it was created how it will be implemented the medias conspiracy of silence protected sharon when he fired cabinet ministers who did not support disengagement
3539526 no argument that the tone in the israeli media is pro disengagement
3539527 for now and before sale of nitel transcorp is the known core investor if there is a core investor and the share purchase agreement specifies that they are in charge nothing stops them from being in charge
3539528 they are in the position to do what the spa empowers them to do until there is another core investor they can do what the spa said they can do we are in support of what they are doing there is nothing wrong with what they are doing
3539529 transcorp actually took control of nitel about four weeks ago before then there was some funny arrangement because a bank lent transcorp money chairman of the bank was brought to be the chairman of nitel the arrangement has been funny
3539530 there was no direction nobody was actually directing the affairs you could not pin nitel to transcorp or the federal government or to the bank now transcorp has come to assert its position they have now taken the right steps all we are interested as nigerians is to bring nitel back to its glory this is not sentiment people are meddling they are misinforming government on what should be done just for their own selfish interests
3539531 are you open now to having a vote for offshore drilling
3539532 we will have a vote its not strictly on offshore drilling well have a vote on an array of initiatives that will protect the consumer that will increase the domestic supply and that will reverse global warming and among those may be some restricting drilling in protected areas if they can comply with the three criteria that i mentioned
3539533 absolutely not the gimmick that the republicans have come up with drill drill drill in the protected areas and it will bring down the price of oil is a complete misrepresneation to the american people there are plenty of places weve had to drill at 68 million acres in the lower 48 where people can drill more than 10 million acres in alaska which are permitted for drilling
3539534 what happens if i add another blog post and then refresh blog list at this point
3539535 every friday we run the sql script xyz to fix some data
3539536 this better be bad news real bad news i told my wife i wouldnt be doing this any more jesus she practically begged me to stop cant you find anyone else
3539537 im sorry jack but only you can handle this this is the worst time yet this time hes gone after famous tourist locations
3539538 i know im sorry to ask you this but do you think you can help the world one last time jack

3539557 we have achieved substantial progress in liberalising the telecommunications industry in our country
3539558 what kenyans now expect is to reap the full benefits of these achievements in terms of cheaper telephone services and increased access
3539559 indeed we are already observing that growth in mobile telephony has provided a reliable form of communication to rural communities thereby enabling our farmers to find markets for their produce
3539560 this has not only enabled businesses to operate at lower costs but has also made communication cheaper for families that live across borders

3539674 something here is highly irregular arthur ive never seen anything quite like it before it certainly isnt a suicide as the police seem to think

3539699 i dont think that theres going to be a re ignition of the cold war dont get me wrong
3539700 i dont think theres going to be nuclear weapons build ups etc but i think that russian behavior is not acceptable and we will do what we can to maintain our alliances and our friends and make the russians understand that this kind of behavior is not a part of what we view as the 21st century

3539704 edward contends that the hospital is necessary because of the areas rapid growth and because one third of the patients at its crowded naperville campus come from the plainfield area
3539705 acting health facilities board chairman susana lopatka said population projections are not certain to materialize and even if they did there would be insufficient demand to support a new hospital by 2015

3539711 2 4 6 8 who do you appreciate me me me me
3539712 two years ago landmark legislation required almost everyone in the commonwealth to have insurance but the law has been so successful prompting an estimated 345 000 people statewide to obtain insurance that it has been far more expensive than expected forcing governor patrick to sign a bill last week raising more than 100 million in state funds and fees on private companies to help foot the bill
3539713 although massachusetts has the most primary care doctors per capita in the country there is evidence that there arent enough to handle the workload especially as the number of people covered by insurance swells
3539714 there are no genes specific only to reading unlike its component parts such as vision and speech which are genetically organized reading has no direct genetic program passing it on to future generations
3539715 we believe something in the brains limbic system is boosting their desire to communicate
3539716 you know that drives are involved in blogging because a lot of people do it compulsively

3539721 they even killed female goats because their private parts were not covered and their tails were pointed upward which they said was haram
3539722 are you open now to having a vote for offshore drilling
3539723 we will have a vote its not strictly on offshore drilling well have a vote on an array of initiatives that will protect the consumer that will increase the domestic supply and that will reverse global warming and among those may be some restricting drilling in protected areas if they can comply with the three criteria that i mentioned
3539724 absolutely not the gimmick that the republicans have come up with drill drill drill in the protected areas and it will bring down the price of oil is a complete misrepresneation to the american people there are plenty of places weve had to drill at 68 million acres in the lower 48 where people can drill more than 10 million acres in alaska which are permitted for drilling
3539725 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3539726 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3539727 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3539728 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3539729 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3539730 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3539731 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3539732 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3539733 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3539734 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3539735 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3539736 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3539737 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3539738 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3539739 even though in halo 3 you finished the fight it doesnt necessarily mean the rides over

3539747 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace
3539748 the purpose of the operation has been achieved the aggressor has been punished and has suffered very considerable losses
3539749 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3539750 i dont think russia will feel like talking with mr saakashvili after what he did to our citizens
3539751 if we have received the order to cease fire this does not mean that we have stopped all actions including reconnaissance
3539752 its like the old soviet days they were making an example of us for ukraine and others to see
3539753 what we need is to get out of a crisis i just want to push people to dialogue

3539762 if we have received the order to cease fire this does not mean that we have stopped all actions including reconnaissance
3539763 its like the old soviet days they were making an example of us for ukraine and others to see
3539764 what we need is to get out of a crisis i just want to push people to dialogue
3539765 tskhinvali doesnt exist its like stalingrad was after the war
3539766 schools hospital houses all infrastructure is ruined theres no water no electricity we will rebuild it
3539767 my ambition has always been to play for my national team and i believe that playing in the biggest league in the world for aston villa will help me realise that
3539768 their first four chances came from us giving away the ball in dangerous areas and being absolutely stupid in taking chances that we didnt need to
3539769 that set the pattern for the game and it wasnt until the last 25 minutes that we actually looked like an attacking force going forward
3539770 i thought we defended terribly and we didnt look solid and believe it or not we had been on the training ground working on that we need to get back on again i think but we got in front with a fortuitous goal and then of course its equalised by hamilton doing the same sort of thing
3539771 in quel momento apparve la volpe lt lt buon giorno gt gt disse la volpe
3539772 madjid bougherra looks a decent centre half but i dont think that will appease the rangers fans much on the back of losing to kaunas in the champions league and then you lose probably your best player last season
3539773 barry ferguson is out and theyve not clicked up front even though theyve brought in a lot of strikers
3539774 they got the win even though they didnt play particularly well against falkirk but its just negativity at the start of the season and its something the rangers fans dont want
3539775 carlos is a top player who cleaned up last year and won all the awards in scotland
3539776 i think if rangers had got through to the champions league getting beaten by kaunas was a major blow financially for the club the supporters may have seen cuellar stay at rangers
3539777 i believe that celtic has closed a perfect piece of business
3539778 we would have taken ricardo quaresma and javier saviola but they both decided not to come
3539779 that deal is now a structure which will hopefully allow us to add players going forward
3539780 hopefully it makes a lot of sense not only with barcelona but with other clubs too
3539781 i love the fans and that is a big thing for me
3539782 i havent heard anything about any interest from any team so this surprises me
3539783 but i just want to concentrate on my team rangers everybody at the club seems quite happy with me and im happy staying
3539784 i saw the game on tuesday night but i had no doubts about having signed
3539785 when you come here you know that rangers will play every season in europe and its a dream for the players
3539786 afterwards it was brighter and i thought my contract is four years and we will win the championship and there will be no worries
3539787 of course european football was a big reason for me coming here
3539788 i saw the uefa cup final last year and i knew that there would be the chance of champions league football every year so it was a dream
3539789 i want to play in the champions league next year
3539790 we started quite well and created a few good chances
3539791 there were balls going across the face of the goal but obviously we never had people in the right positions to convert the chances
3539792 and i think that was an essential part of the game against inverness
3539793 i just the feel that we should have had somebody on the end of the balls bouncing about in the box to give us the first goal and it frustration just develops and grows from there
3539794 i think you try things that you wouldnt at the start of a game
3539795 obviously youre trying to get that goal and you need one to at least get a draw and i think if we had got the goal we wouldve went on but the goal we lost was disappointing as well but thats just the way the game panned out
3539796 i think to come from a goal behind against a team like dundee united and score three goals theyve tested us late on in the game thomas cerny certainly made a couple of good saves but i think overall i think we thoroughly deserved it
3539797 i said before we will play in the right manner and i think we showed that tonight
3539798 i think the two young boys in the middle of the park were sensational james mcarthur and james mccarthy and the most important thing for me is that were a team were a unit
3539799 if you get that in a football team then youve always got a chance
3539800 were not going to get carried away its the opening game and i think were top of the league just like last season i joke at that but youve got to enjoy these times
3539801 the players worked really really hard there are tired players in there and rightly so but to beat dundee united in the manner we did is fantastic for me and this club
3539802 i didnt see it i think the players are talking about it but to be honest with you i think mark mclaughlin won the header and i thought that was the goal
3539803 i think there may be a touch off james mcarthur so i hear ill look at that tonight but you take these wee breaks when you get them
3539804 this has come as a surprise and i am disappointed
3539805 carlos cuellar has been a great player for the football club and inevitably there has been speculation about him playing in the premiership
3539806 the club has received a substantial uplift in fee and we will now reinvest in the team
3539807 i came to rangers due to the professional manner of their officials and management and the promise of success
3539808 everything i had been told about this fantastic club has been true and last years uefa cup run is something i will never forget
3539809 my ambition has always been to play for my national team and i believe that by playing in the biggest league in the world for aston villa will help me realise that
3539810 when i told martin bain on sunday that i wanted to leave i did so with sadness
3539811 the rangers supporters have been fantastic to me but i am young and want to play at the highest level and i hope they will always welcome me back
3539812 i have to say how sickened i was with the bbcs ten o clock news coverage of the situation in georgia rarely have i saw such blatant pro russia propaganda gleefully broadcast by the bbc did you see it the bbc exhibits a pride in russian military prowess that it never could in our british forces revolting stuff
3539813 how can i miss you if you wont go away
3539814 what is it that makes you feel like youve done something wrong
3539815 students are graduating with massive debts that prevent them from saving spending and generally contributing back to society and the economy this is only going to get worse
3539816 there is now incontrovertible evidence that education should be understood as an economic investment
3539817 books especially textbooks are the chief representatives of the lore and wisdom of the past
3539818 teachers are the agents through which knowledge and skills are communicated and rules of conduct enforced
3539819 based on profound knowledge embraces the empirical world of people and problems in a deeper way than purely self generated artistry can do
3539820 when we are able to develop a comprehensive sustainable industrial practice at a cost effective scale and scope will we be able to meet the worlds needs until then it rests on all 3 legs of science observation theorizing
3539821 meaningful research addresses specific problems but at the same time it contributes to the collective knowledge pool
3539822 there is a difference between training students for entry level positions in design offices and educating designers for advanced practice and life long learning as should happen in universities
3539823 students should be instructed but they should be taught to learn on their own both from others and from their environment
3539824 the vast range of technologies that surround us mediate most of the human world and influence our daily lives the world can grow worse as well as better
3539825 much could be said about how we need to modify formal education and the media so they can contribute better to the thinking revolution
3539826 for instance in comparison to the wildlife program on tv looking at the real thing seems to be a dull and fruitless activity
3539827 digesting massive amounts of information within the constructs of separate disciplines and cultures such as science and art
3539828 the forces associated with globalization have conditioned the context in which educators operate
3539829 schools and colleges have become sites for branding and the targets for corporate expansion
3539830 it would not be a sign of health if such an important social interest as education were not also an arena of struggles practical and theoretical
3539831 the history of educational theory is marked by opposition between the idea that education is development from within and that it is formation from without
3539832 weve made the leap from an idea centered business to a people centered business instead of developing ideas we develop people instead of investing in ideas we invest in people were trying to create a culture of learning filled with lifelong learners its no trick for talented people to be interesting but its a gift to be interested we want an organization filled with interested people
3539833 community is not just the place or context in which education is to occur fostering community is also a central concern
3539834 not only does social life demand teaching and learning for its own permanence but the very process of living together educates
3539835 enlarges and enlightens experience it stimulates and enriches imagination it creates responsibility for accuracy and vividness of statement and thought
3539836 many of the ways we have of talking about learning and education are based on the assumption that learning is something that individuals do
3539837 an intranet can play valuable role in supporting the establishment and ongoing activity of a community of practice
3539838 as the basis for establishing the identity of a group
3539839 offering a mechanism by which the output of the community of practice can be disseminated to the rest of the organization
3539840 once captured this knowledge can be shared with other areas or stored for future use
3539841 a future where a seamless knowledge management environment encompassing both the physical and online worlds will start to be a practical reality
3539842 social capital refers to the institutions relationships and norms that shape the quality and quantity of a societys social interactions social capital is not just the sum of the institutions which underpin a society it is the glue that holds them together
3539843 a direct drain upon involvement in groups and social capital building activities
3539844 interaction enables people to build communities to commit themselves to each other and to knit the social fabrics
3539845 linking residence to one another increasing participation in local civic organisations encouraging reciprocity and thereby fostering social capital
3539846 members of the community will communicate via the intranet and will meet face to face more often as each mode reinforces the other
3539847 the absense of critical mass provides a theoretical account for the low participation rate
3539848 can be developed within existing local communities with a critical mass of like minded people
3539849 stronger development of co operative relationships between people families and communities outside the large institutional structures is the perfect complement to personal and household self reliance
3539850 learning and teaching should not stand on opposite banks and just watch the river flow by instead they should embark together on a journey down the water through an active reciprocal exchange teaching can strengthen learning how to learn
3539851 the white house orders the cia to fabricate a letter from this guy habbush which clears them of their political dilemma of going to war under false pretenses
3539852 theres a relationship to the iraq intelligence chief we made him our source he tells us there are no wmd
3539853 stop your whining everybody has to work and in many cases more than one job
3539854 he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of christ jesus
3539855 what makes a man a man a friend of mine once wondered
3539856 we dont have that leniency factor if youre going a couple miles over in a school zone thats a good enough reason to get a ticket at that point
3539857 we have the motorcycles whose in special operations that will be out enforcing some of those school zones
3539858 well be more visible in those areas because you know now that school has started we will be in those areas a little more often and paying a little bit more attention to things in that area
3539859 in a majority of the rural areas there arent flashing light but there are signs posted with times and days which school zones are enforced
3539860 you should follow that speed limit until you see other signs stating that the speed limit has changed or the school zone has ended
3539861 hopefully get people to slow down and remember that kids are going to be out walking around and being pedestrians again
3539862 i opened the box and found a diamond ring inside
3539863 her son works two jobs and was going to propose that very day
3539864 he suddenly brought out the ring from behind his back and i just started bawling
3539865 i asked him to follow me over to the bank to give him the 100 reward he wouldnt accept the reward though
3539866 i know my wife would be sick if she lost her ring
3539867 there wasnt anything else to do it wasnt rightfully mine i had to find the owner
3539868 i opened the box and found a diamond ring inside
3539869 her son works two jobs and was going to propose that very day
3539870 he suddenly brought out the ring from behind his back and i just started bawling
3539871 i asked him to follow me over to the bank to give him the 100 reward he wouldnt accept the reward though
3539872 i know my wife would be sick if she lost her ring
3539873 there wasnt anything else to do it wasnt rightfully mine i had to find the owner
3539874 there can be no assurance that impairment charges will not be required in the future and any such amounts may be material

3539886 had not developed or implemented an accident prevention program related to scaffolding
3539887 had not received the information and training related to scaffolding
3539888 after doing our research in the very crowded world of search engine marketing companies we agreed that medium blues attentiveness to details during the pre sales process and reputation in the industry made the choice clear
3539889 in the short time we have worked with the search engine marketing companys professional and knowledgeable staff we have already seen great results in our organic search rankings we look forward to furthering the progress of this seo campaign and anticipate a great long term relationship
3539890 we look forward to delivering top notch results and seeing ids leads and traffic increase dramatically in the coming months
3539891 he is being received as a tremendous candidate throughout the state
3539892 people just want to see him raise a little bit more money and maybe get the dccc involved and build the campaign
3539893 to be eligible as an independent or political group candidate in the general election
3539894 but i think it would show desperation on the part of someone who decides to challenge him
3539895 we believe the huge demand for me reflects the publics interest in having a personal connection with the web
3539896 from interesting topics to organization names to brands me sites give personality to the content on the web sites associated with them
3539897 if in fact a google property is taking money away from googles partners that is a real problem
3539898 the question in peoples minds is how unbiased can google be as it grows and grows and grows
3539899 when you see knol pages rank high they are there because they have earned their position
3539900 you look so dumb right now standing outside my house trying to apologize ur so ugly when u cry please just cut it out

3539903 as in so many things new zealand does internationally we tend to punch above our weight the way we do that is having good people at the right conferences
3539904 i want whats good for everybody not just whats good for me whos the best for the nation right now
3539905 should the u s a commit to go to war with russia on behalf of georgia
3539906 should the u s a commit to go to war with russia on behalf of caucasians
3539907 america has the second highest business tax rates in the world is it any wonder that jobs are moving overseas were taxing businesses out of the country
3539908 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3539909 half of all business income in the united states now ends up going through the individual tax code
3539910 its time for the big corporations to pay their fair share
3539911 youre not so scary whys he so afraid of you
3539912 it was such a great event that the coyotes put on for our patients and families
3539913 the kids really loved the carnival and it gave them a temporary escape from being in the hospital and allowed for a positive outlet we truly appreciate the coyotes for all they do for phoenix childrens hospital
3539914 having the support of the coyotes means so much and having a personal visit with all kinds of fun activities for our patients brought a bright spot to their day and smiles to their faces
3539915 when we see the staff of the phoenix coyotes wearing purple ribbons and supporting our efforts to prevent drownings we are so grateful they are an active part of the effort to make the lives of children in our community better
3539916 well thats all well and good but how do i mark up the address of the place i live
3539917 how should i mark up something like the date of an event
3539918 ah but there is an element for addresses its called address
3539919 now your web site could really be your api with goodness of microformats and power of optimus
3539920 mom im in mcdonalds and theyre playing our song i love you
3539921 some guy tried to grab me so i stabbed him
3539922 its probably good that the guys dead so he cant identify me
3539923 gerard was like a child in many ways he was a good happy jolly boy
3539924 they came in almost every day and ken would jokingly complain that he never won anything
3539925 i cant see an ulterior motive for their deaths thats why its so sad
3539926 we have no suspects we have not developed a motive
3539927 she was one of the best people you could ever possibly know
3539928 she loved the pokies and i would see her every day and it doesnt seem fair i will miss her terribly
3539929 we are a private family and dont wish to comment
3539930 we managed to get one out we just couldnt reach the other
3539931 he had a beautiful expansive garden he was known for it
3539932 the spider taketh hold with her hands and is in kings palaces
3539933 his divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness he has given us his very great and precious promises so that through them you may participate in the divine nature

3539935 well its 25 more than youre gonna get for your eight hundred dollar vcr of the same era isnt it
3539936 ive got my spot in this traffic jam and im three inches off the bumper of the next car and im doin 4 mph and im damned if im gonna stop to let in that pushy loud huge red truck with the strobe lights
3539937 these homes are not fit for anyone to live in
3539938 in the brush in the middle of nowhere on a dead end road
3539939 weve known for a while they were a little strange that they didnt want interference from the outside world but unless were down there on a call its not part of our routine patrol
3539940 jail is inappropriate for these folks but to go untreated is not the answer either
3539941 it has to be the worst case of animal abuse in the history of vermont
3539942 as soon as you step in youre covered head to toe with fleas
3539943 shes as starved for affection as she is food she still has diarrhea
3539944 they said they didnt know why their animals were dying they were very angry we were taking the animals away from them and they didnt offer any information they simply said were taking care of them but theyre dying theres nothing we can do the response they gave was very strange
3539945 would you like to switch your choice to the other door
3539946 you are hereby directed to come in to the party headquarters and explain your comments and why you should remain a national delegate to the 2008 democratic national convention in light of these comments
3539947 isnt there a right to free speech isnt this right in line with our time honored tradition with the dems
3539948 these intimidation tactics have a chilling effect on people feeling comfortable speaking up
3539949 we wanted to explore with ms millstone the possibility of her voluntarily resigning her position
3539950 its inevitable within a party of this size that there will be different views about the merits of the candidates that the parties put forward
3539951 priority to ensure ms millstones delegate status was not in jeopardy
3539952 were getting too near the convention and shes refused to come in
3539953 ugh im dreading my chem final i dont think im gonna do as well as i should

3539956 its a great opera a work of serious genius the father son relationship is rich and powerful but you have to do all the recitatives
3539957 there were too many bmws in the car park and i can say that because i drive one myself i had originally intended the company to become site specific but never managed it because touring used to be the big god if you toured you got funding but in order to tour you have to have a product to sell that wasnt what i wanted
3539958 the appeal was listened to and we got the funding back so all fairness to the arts council for that
3539959 i dont want to create an opera company in that sense
3539960 it offers a conduit which is the opposite of what you get across an orchestra pit with an all white cast and chorus
3539961 yes with great care i consciously set out more or less to match the demographic of the city
3539962 is that to do it well costs a lot of money
3539963 without subsidy it wont exist anyone in this show will tell you what opera can do for them that nothing else can its a luxury but so are most things these events become very important to these peoples lives they buy the cds they listen they go to see other shows
3539964 has a huge leg up on foreign policy and military matters will translate into a huge leg up for our country if we still care enough about world and about our national security to elect him president
3539965 i looked into putins eyes and i saw three letters a k a g and a b
3539966 in my opinion the choice could not be more clear between one candidate john mccain whos had experience been tested in war and tried in peace another candidate who has not mr
3539967 between one candidate john mccain who has always put the country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate who has not between one candidate whos a talker and the other candidate whos the leader america needs as our next president

3539992 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3539993 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3539994 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3539995 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3539996 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
3539997 they have already forgotten the terror attack in merkaz harav the government is abandoning the well being of the nations students
3539998 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
3539999 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
