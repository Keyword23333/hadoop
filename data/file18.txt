180001 left me puzzled i was pleasantly surprised to find that no fun demo is in fact a disc of excellently executed pop like songs it is apparent that felipe had been assembling a collection of his own little ditties between 2001 and 2007 amidst consistent forays into noise

180005 the wind blows where it wishes and you hear the sound of it but cannot tell where it comes from and where it goes so is everyone who is born of the spirit
180006 good luck scotty thanks for ending 42 years of frustration and thanks for doing it again and again oh and again

180009 a key issue over buying robinho has always been that real are looking for a replacement
180010 it is fair to say that is what has been holding up discussions
180011 it has not progressed over the last couple of days but the window is open until the end of august and theres still plenty of time to run
180012 it would be a dream for me to work with luiz felipe scolari who is one of the best coaches in the world
180013 i have always spoken highly of him and he has always spoken very highly of me since well before he was at chelsea
180014 in 2003 when i was unknown in europe he called me to play in a charity match it was brief but it was enough for me to see his style and character
180015 madrid have failed to value him as he deserves and i do not like the fact that they tried to include him in the ronaldo deal money is not the problem for us now
180016 what matters for robinho is to leave the club and play for scolari at chelsea
180017 i think there is absolutely no question that any deal will be done with regard to didier drogba
180018 didier is in rehab and will continue to be a chelsea player we can squash that one
180019 our information is he was shot at 12 noon 7pm sydney time
180020 there was a fight between two families and we understand he was shot dead by a member of one of the families
180021 the previous australian government is responsible for another terrible crime by forcing refugees to be sent back to gaza when they knew the situation there
180022 this guy had problems with israel and the palestinian authority he claimed to have been tortured and the previous government knew all that and still forced him out
180023 it is a tragedy because we have lost another young person who who could have been a good australian citizen
180024 people think i might be wilful in some way with the material but no my aim above all is clarity
180025 i thought maybe id got second or third i certainly didnt expect to win again
180026 i just wanted to show that with their habitat in the foreground and the background so you get an overall view
180027 all about the beat why hip hop cant save black america
180028 of course obama and his people have to condemn the rap because it does say some vulgar things
180029 if youre running for president youre supposed to be an upstanding individual
180030 theyre thinking an obama who knows how to play the game is still better for me than a mccain
180031 there are a ton of people who clearly are looking for obama to denounce this in order to continue to view him as credible
180032 he for political purposes has to separate himself from anything controversially black
180033 im not aware of hip hop music affecting any election so far and i dont think that this is going to be one either
180034 theres no doubt that hip hop culture moves our young people powerfully and some of it is not just a reflection of reality
180035 it also creates reality i think that if all our kids see is a glorification of materialism and bling and casual sex and kids are never seeing themselves reflected as hitting the books and being responsible and delaying gratification then they are getting an unrealistic picture of what the world is like
180036 it was fun when we were older too of course but when i was a child with my brothers that was really something
180037 we started playing country western but my brother loulou who played the drums complained because there nothing for him to do
180038 see load drums to that and you get rock and roll
180039 i know john lennon then playing backup for the tony sheridan band saw us perform a lot of the british did but id never dare say we influenced them
180040 this race and this country and this life produced me he said i shall express myself as i am

180046 do you have free dvd of independence of the seas royal
180047 were trying to keep the aisles open so the customers can easily navigate the store thats just a simple thing but shopping is hectic enough
180048 the tax free holiday is absolutely a benefit to the customers
180049 its just a great opportunity you get to extend your buying power
180050 with all the needs the start of a new school year brings this is a way for families to stretch their hard earned money a bit farther and an opportunity to generate significant business for our retailers
180051 the international media continued that media witch hunt so that is now unimaginable to many people that this court could acquit me
180052 the first irregularity i would mention is the media witch hunt which began in the muslim media even before the beginning of the armed conflict and which proclaimed me a war war criminal at a time when the only victims were serbs
180053 the international media continued that media witch hunt so that is now unimaginable to many people that this court could acquit me i believe that this fact seriously jeopardises the trial itself
180054 whatever he was doing on top of the pole caused a power outage for a few minutes
180055 one of the key issues over buying robinho has always been that real madrid are looking for a replacement
180056 it is fair to say that is what has been holding up discussions between the two clubs
180057 it has not progressed over the last couple of days but the window is open until the end of august and theres still plenty of time to run
180058 i think there is absolutely no question that any deal will be done with regard to didier drogba
180059 didier is in rehab and will continue to be a chelsea player we can squash that one
180060 with regard to diego i was as amazed as everybody else to read it in the newspapers this morning so again i think thats just pure speculation

180071 there is hardly a thing i can say in its favor except that i was cheered by nearly every minute of it i cannot argue for the script the direction the acting or even the mummy but i can say that i was not bored and sometimes i was unreasonably pleased there is a little immaturity stuck away in the crannies of even the most judicious of us and we should treasure it

180073 there is still a lot of anger and frustration among shareholders right now
180074 it will not do shareholders or yahoo any good to have the annual meeting turn into a media event for no purpose
180075 last week i realised it was impossible to gain enough support from the large institutions to win a majority of the yahoo directorships
180076 a few days ago i met with both jerry yang and yahoo chairman roy bostock and i believe both gentlemen genuinely wish that we will be able to work together to enhance value while we still disagree on many points i have great hope this will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship

180085 we thought when we drafted him that he would have the ability to play tackle
180086 thats why we drafted him there was no concern there that he had to be a guard he was going to be a tackle we put him out there and hes going to play left tackle for us
180087 hes going to go through some growing pains and thats part of it
180088 but the guy has very good feet is a very good athlete a smart guy very smart and picks up things he learns something every day
180089 through its participation in the highly competitive auction shaw obtained licenses that fit within its objectives
180090 cra drew upon our experience advising on similar spectrum auctions around the world to assist shaw and were pleased to have helped the company achieve a successful result
180091 there is no doubt he has a great deal still to offer in the professional game
180092 on that basis we have agreed that we are prepared to loan alex to another county over the course of the rest of the season should an opportunity arise and we wish him well in his future career wherever he ends up
180093 i have thoroughly enjoyed my four years at essex and am delighted to have been able to prove my fitness during my time at the club i understand my opportunities will be limited with essex from now on but i feel i still have plenty to offer and am keen to get the chance to prove that with another county

180101 right to bear arms is not limited to the physical confines of the home
180102 violates the individual right to bear arms protected by the second amendment
180103 here the government does not allege that mr vargas possessed the weapon with intent to use it unlawfully or outside of his home
180104 mr vargas is accused of keeping a gun in his home this conduct is protected by the individual right to bear arms enshrined in the second amendment
180105 the question now becomes which defendants with guns in their homes should benefit from that constitutional right
180106 one issue becomes whether to allow defendants to make these types of challenges even though they never applied for the permit
180107 mr vargas is alleged in essence not to have submitted himself to the complete discretion and the extraordinary power of the new york city police commissioner

180126 i have concerns that many of the people who pray here have not been allowed to become members
180127 this may be the best deal out there in the present real estate climate and i dont want to be the one to destroy the best chance to preserve the shul in perpetuity
180128 the neighborhood is changing and its a dwindling congregation and to deny membership to new families in that situation is very troubling why not be more transparent and reach out to new people
180129 while a six story building may not be out of scale for the area it would be a shame to lose this great piece of lower east side history
180130 i hope the congregation would consider a plan to keep the existing building and build on top
180131 but weve determined that the building at 415 e sixth st is not a priority right now
180132 its wonderful news if it means that the shul will be here for years to come

180143 eclipses were reported where none took place in areas of political or bureaucratic strife
180144 the urge to seek links between the olympics and natural phenomena such as the eclipse is understandable if not exactly rational said jiang xiaoyuan a social sciences professor at shanghais jiaotong university who has written about astronomy research and patriotism in china
180145 wed already known about this eclipse many years before we got the right to host the olympics so how can we explain this is retribution

180152 what ensued was a very messy scene where the anesthesiologists could not reintubate the patient and the surgeon could not establish
180153 an indictment albeit at an unfortunate time politically for the hospital on the nursing and respiratory care at sharp grossmont
180154 the patient did have complications post surgery in icu coded and expired
180155 there is no evidence at this time the tube was dislodged and definitely no information regarding lack of observation
180156 i honestly believe this message is coming from an individual who has a history of conflict with our management a man who has intent to harm sharp grossmont publicly
180157 medical record keeping was purposefully watered down to avoid stating what actually happened and to avoid a formal inquiry and autopsy

180167 being a teen girl series i mean its just so natural for that particular customer and readership to share their enthusiasm electronically and thats exactly whats happened and stephenie meyer herself from the outset has been great about communicating with her fans on her own website so theyre just as actively engaged if not more actively engaged in the series as harry potter fans were

180731 i may be a candidate again but i firmly believe as i did then that we need recall and term limits for the county executive
180732 basescu si tariceanu au in interiorul lor ceva impotriva tiganetului dar nu o recunosc
180733 all these disgruntled people and no wants to do anything
180734 its hard trying to show people you are transparent for so long it was the other way around and people just dont trust you
180735 its depressing where are all the people that are concerned
180736 if any member of the sitting board of education continues to allow selfish motives to enable dissension and promote disharmony the chances for us to retain our accreditation are slim indeed
180737 sometimes i feel ashamed to say i am from clayton county because we have so many problems
180738 i urge you to cooperate work together and try to solve the internal problem you have
180739 i know we got to get sacs taken care but i have concerns about conduct and discipline
180740 last night i was a trillionaire today ill be using coins
180741 a popula o ir preferir um engenheiro a uma psic loga e um anestesista
180742 youll protect me yeah wont ya iron man wont ya
180743 we assume that 2009 will be another difficult year full of challenges
180744 the microsoft negotiations were just the latest example of the negligence by this board
180745 there is still a lot of anger and frustration among shareholders right now
180746 we believe the board is independent and focused on value creation for long term shareholders
180747 i havent spoken to anyone who thinks hey this is the right team to lead yahoo
180748 i hope there will be enough shareholder pressure at this meeting for the board to realize they need to bring in someone else to run the company
180749 while we still disagree on many points i have great hope this will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship
180750 i am as excited as i have ever been to lead this company
180751 shit i have known some people that can shake it like a salt shaker in the club and be as dead as a log in the sack

180759 the whole idea behind the supergirl shield is a feeling of empowerment when a girl wears the clothing she will feel empowered
180760 thats what we want to get across with this collection the voices of the girls behind the symbol of empowerment will be the three designers
180761 we are planning to make more donations not only to the u 17 since our organization thinks that we have a part to play in the development of sierra leone football to reach its highest peak
180762 the donation we gave the u 17 is a little one to start with these donations will be going to u 17 and different sporting disciplines in the country
180763 the key here is that we dont have a lot of answers
180764 we need to set the futures market straight and try to wring these speculators out
180765 if you have a whole fleet of brand new airplanes you cant just ground them and ride this out
180766 if it were as easy as charging 10 more dont you think these companies would have thought of that
180767 i think sentients problem is a lot more serious than people realize
180768 sentient clearly overpaid for the companies that it bought thinking the industry would continue to be incredibly robust it turned quickly
180769 we ended up with fairly substantial delays in billing for charters conducted by sentient
180770 our billing cycle had stretched to 31 days because of some of the issues that arose out of the back office and accounting integration when youre doing 800 million a year in revenue thats quite a bit of working capital to tie up in a fairly short period of time so that truly did create some issues with payables
180771 will be used primarily for bringing vendor payments back into line we anticipate this is probably a 60 day hiccup for us that well get over quickly
180772 we believe that the fastest way to get oil prices under control in the short term
180773 is by reducing reckless and unfair speculation in the futures markets while at the same time enacting measures for the mid and long term to expand oil supplies enhance efforts to advance alternative and renewable energy sources and improve energy conservation across the board
180774 saya percaya pengundi permatang pauh tidak ada masalah dengan anwar yang sinonim dengan kawasan tersebut
180775 itu juga satu motivasi untuk kita bekerja dengan lebih kuat bagi mempastikan kemenangan
180776 architecture and layout planning so that the aircrafts detail plans will merge into a master development schedule
180777 were going to do it in a much more serial fashion
180778 we think we can certify this airplane in maybe 30 months
180779 because theres so much commonality were not doing a new wing so stall testing and performance testing is going to be pretty straightforward
180780 this first flight is a historically significant moment for cirrus and the opening of a new chapter for all of aviation
180781 more than 125 dedicated engineers and technicians have worked tirelessly to ensure that this milestone was met in a safe and efficient manner with this successful flight we initiate the next program phase that will support the more rigorous certification program
180782 thats when we woke up and realized garmin was for real
180783 the three screen system with autopilot and flight management system thats in the mustang today could easily be put into a cj or a premier i or any of the competing products in the light jet category next time we get ready to do a model refresh im sure well be competing the avionics
180784 we plan to continue to innovate and we intend to continue to grow
180785 we will reach out to new platforms but im not going to say per se which direction were moving as youve seen so far we have moved into the experimental marketplace we developed a system for the lsa skycatcher from cessna and we continue to broaden our spectrum in the turbine market with various platforms part 23 has been fertile ground for us and weve done quite well there but of course we continue to look and explore whether there are opportunities outside part 23 for garmin
180786 were firm believers that if you build quality reliable innovative products and support them very well you win
180787 its sometimes challenging to do but we think weve done a pretty good job
180788 do you need that kind of resolution when youre flying along in a 172 at 100 knots maybe not but in a 50 million gulfstream you absolutely want our data
180789 its hard to show weather hazards in a route sensitive context by viewing individual weather maps
180790 the interactive map gives you the ability to layer many of the weather products we offer within the context of your route of flight
180791 they like it but they want it to be faster
180792 you get less corrosion but where you do get it it is intensified
180793 develop a nondestructive inspection technique or combination of techniques capable of consistently detecting bonding defects such as voids debonds and weak kissing bonds in bond areas between the skin and spar at the tip of the blade and between the skin and tip cap for r22 and r44 helicopters
180794 a dime sized hole will produce a distinct whistling sound
180795 lgbt life love spirituality and happenings plus oregon equality news
180796 gay and lesbian couples from outside massachusetts are now free to marry in the state
180797 terry caster owns a 1 self storage company of san diego a 1 self storage has 40 locations throughout california with over 4 million storage units mr caster and his family have contributed nearly 300 000 to the protect marriage campaign that makes the caster family the biggest contributors from san diego county where 35 of the money came from to qualify proposition 8 for the november 4th ballot
180798 when we first analyzed that it was one of the major pacing items for us to maintain the schedule we had
180799 with a new forging we would have seen possibly a six to eight month delay
180800 the lead time now for these high strength special metal forgings is really getting very difficult
180801 the whole industry is suffering with the heavy demand on these exotic materials so for us it was a must that we were able to achieve that
180802 even though it is basically the same design as the 900s at the part number level there probably isnt one part in the wing that is exactly the same
180803 wing skins wing spars ribs et cetera have all been re stressed to the new weights
180804 the gearing change allowed us to increase for the same column movement the position of the elevator so that someone accustomed to the 700 and 900 would get the same type of rotation from the same type of movement
180805 it all has to do with establishing pilot commonality in the handling of the airplane
180806 usually bombardier doesnt like to take an inordinate amount of risk in developing new technology but this is something that liebherr had been working on they offered it to us we saw an opportunity to simplify the build and at the same time improve reliability
180807 this is going to be part of the training that were going to provide with the new airplane
180808 i understand from a brake wear point of view you have to have a technique where you dont drag on the brakes you try not to use carbon brakes lightly so on a landing our crews would be trained to do a good firm brake application until the airplane has decelerated then do three or four little shots of brake application
180809 the 900 was not body angle limited but this airplane will be
180810 in fact we are working on a flight director that will provide active rotation guidance to pilots so that we dont get into any tail contact
180811 we expect that there will not be any major issues with the airplane from a handling point of view in any axis when compared to the 900
180812 we have to optimize the entire electric chain generation storage and equipment power
180813 on an airplane flight controls are redundant thanks to the number of control surfaces several ailerons for example with several actuators on a helicopter each actuator is critical and must contain its own redundancy
180814 landing gear retraction requires much fluid flow meanwhile controlling the main rotor requires a lot of pressure as a result hydraulic pumps are oversized to meet both pressure and flow criteria
180815 we now ask our suppliers to be ready to provide 270v capable equipment
180816 compared with turbine engines diesels have a lower sfc low power turboshafts are less efficient than more powerful ones moreover their best efficiency is at takeoff over a flight cycle efficiency becomes relatively poor diesels have more consistent behavior through all conditions and are much more efficient over a flight cycle
180817 a diesels specific weight is three or four times that of a turbine
180818 how long does it take in flight to offset the extra engine weight with fuel savings
180819 our proof of concept will probably be a bit heavy we also anticipate challenges in vibration levels and adaptation of the mechanical transmission
180820 these engines are not powerful enough and their sfc is too high for the demonstrator
180821 a methodology for data acquisition and analysis in the definition of low noise flight procedures
180822 it takes into account the particular characteristics of noise directivity including the issue of advancing and retreating blades which makes helicopter noise so complex to study
180823 its a sellers market for skilled aviation technicians staffing has been the most daunting task
180824 essentially we have come to the conclusion that for many jobs we will have to grow our own employees
180825 but above that threshold you need to transition to a more process centric organization so you can keep quality standards at the same high level the overall experience of our workforce is not as high as it was five years ago
180826 so we supplement that with robust processes and procedures so we can be assured that every aircraft is assembled and tested the same no matter who is at the end of the wrench
180827 we just completed a 250 000 renovation of our mro hangar and we are refocusing that business
180828 the developments that come out of the captain project will simplify and accelerate the deployment of ttp based systems in aerospace applications
180829 the simplest solution is to avoid looking directly at the glare source
180830 of course sometimes thats easier said than done since the glare source is the brightest most interesting object in your field of vision
180831 reasoning based on solid physiological and perceptual concepts and backed up by almost 60 years of empirical research yields no real support for the use of fully tinted glare blocking glasses as a means of achieving safer nighttime driving
180832 polarized lenses help mostly with reflected glare such as the kind you get off snow water and road surfaces
180833 im just having fun and trying to win games and thats it i just try not to think about whats going on and just take it one at bat at a time and try and do something every day to help us win thats it keep it simple
180834 well sometimes youve got to get lucky and turn on a few and then the key for me is using the whole field
180835 if theyre throwing it away just keep hitting it to left if they start coming in turn on it and make it tough on where theyre going to pitch you
180836 it was a little different this year going in a little more relaxed and just have fun with it
180837 i didnt want to use that as an excuse its just one of those things and hopefully the swing can keep feeling good
180838 hitting fourth the past couple of years and fifth before that and being in that spot the more i get up there the more comfortable i feel
180839 you try to do less when youre younger you start trying to do more and put pressure on yourself to come through in those situations now you just relax and have confidence in the guy behind you if they dont give you anything to hit take the walk and make it easy on yourself dont try and do too much you learn as you get older that simpler is sometimes better and you just have to find that
180840 its something that every kid playing peewee football in eden prairie like i did dreams about someday playing for the vikings so its great to be out here and be part of the team
180841 thats certainly a career path to envy and hopefully i get a chance to have that same kind of success here i think this is a great team and a great organization hopefully i can grow and become a better player here
180842 the evolution from the college game to the pro game of being aware of whats going on around you ratchets up even again
180843 its a huge jump from high school to college and again from college to the pros of having to know whats going on on the entire field and not just the 5 yards around you thats definitely taking a little bit of getting used to
180844 i knew that i probably wasnt going to get drafted but that i would have a shot as a priority free agent
180845 so i wasnt disappointed i just wanted to get everything figured out about where i was going to be afterwards and im glad it ended up being here
180846 this website is a data portal that provides parents educators media policymakers elected officials and anyone who cares about education and equity direct access to important alarming data on the devastating reality of education for black males across all 50 states
180847 the report should give quite a bit to think about for one thing colorado didnt even qualify for inclusion in the report because we have fewer than 10 000 black male students i also wonder about the usefulness of these kind of comparisons and how they impact the studied group the new york ok back to real estate for a moment heres the nars rosey take on the housing bill of course the summary ignores the economic impacts entirely the email accompanying the link said great news president bush just signed into law the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 this is a major victory for realtors consumers and our nation and you helped make it happen
180848 this is the nirvana of what weve been talking about for years

180863 i am one of the few men in the city with nothing wrong with him
180864 he turned himself in and confessed to murdering his sister to cleanse his familys honour because she disappeared from home for four months with a man
180865 he killed her the moment she returned home last night but forensic tests showed that the girl was a virgin
180866 our information is he was shot at 12 noon 7pm sydney time
180867 there was a fight between two families and we understand he was shot dead by a member of one of the families
180868 the previous australian government is responsible for another terrible crime by forcing refugees to be sent back to gaza when they knew the situation there
180869 this guy had problems with israel and the palestinian authority he claimed to have been tortured and the previous government knew all that and still forced him out
180870 it is a tragedy because we have lost another young person who who could have been a good australian citizen
180871 its a tragic story that could have been prevented if we would have been a bit more humane to asylum seekers who have a case

180878 they are not just academically competitive but also demonstrate great leadership potential and an intense desire to give back to their communities in this years class we have presidents and secretaries of the national honor society students who have participated in humanitarian relief missions volunteered at hospice care worked with special needs children were participants of student council as well as artists and musicians
180879 we are equally as excited about the upcoming class of 2009
180880 they are a cohort who demonstrate the same caliber of commitment to excellence
180881 most importantly we are acknowledging the pinnacle of our success the development of students to their fullest potential in order to help them realize their dreams
180882 the field of unmanned and autonomous systems is evolving rapidly and new techniques are needed to effectively test and evaluate the capabilities that are being inserted into these systems this is especially challenging for systems that are increasing in levels of autonomy
180883 our task is to develop a roadmap that identifies new approaches to testing autonomous systems and details what needs to be tested how the autonomous technologies can be tested and when the testing needs to occur
180884 many new technologies are being developed for unmanned and autonomous systems that must be tested and evaluated before they can be deployed new approaches are needed for testing and measuring the robustness of these systems especially in non deterministic and evolving environments
180885 the only way to know how to test them is to understand both the details of the technology and the system that it is going into gtri has extensive experience in both areas and can uniquely couple fundamental research with warfighter systems
180886 there is a strong desire from the warfighter to get these systems into the field
180887 this coupled with the rapid pace at which unmanned and autonomous systems are developing creates a need to consider new options for more flexible testing of unmanned systems through this roadmap the government has asked us to help define these options
180888 the current roadmap award builds on gtris long term experience with test and evaluation for government customers and couples it with gtris strong knowledge of unmanned systems
180889 they are being chosen over manned systems when the situation involves the dull long mission times the dirty sampling for hazardous materials and the dangerous lethal exposure to hostile action and when the unmanned systems can provide capabilities that are not achievable by manned systems
180890 we feel an immense responsibility to the students we train to offer them opportunities to hone their distinctive specialties whether it be acting design research or technical production
180891 when the timing is right as it is for several collaborations this year we are thrilled to work with these companies and know that the public will benefit from the partnerships as well
180892 two signature aspects of madison are its socio political awareness and the fact that it is home to a respected university the coupling of producing this play while collaborating with uw madison is a great offering to madison residents whether they be lovers of theatrical and or grecian history political activists or university students and alumni this collaboration will bring to the stage a powerful evening dealing with one of the central concerns of our era war and its aftermath
180893 the brains development is very complicated and were really just starting to understand how it works
180894 its still one of the big mysteries of science how is the brain built how does its structure mediate thoughts decisions and actions
180895 the connections between the thalamus and the cortex mediate all of your conscious perceptions and actions so your thoughts would be disconnected from your body if you didnt have these connections
180896 we dont know for sure but there is some evidence to suggest that there are problems with these connections in people with epilepsy mental retardation and possibly schizophrenia perhaps related to defects in the way that the layer structure of the brain forms and in general brain growth
180897 were really looking at these issues on multiple levels both within the department of cell biology and other departments we are trying to understand how changes in the structures of individual cells can cause changes in the shapes of whole tissues or whole organisms whether during development in a disease state or during evolution
180898 underpaying workers on public contracts is a despicable yet all too common practice contractors who cheat the public works system by keeping wages earned by workers and lying to government agencies must be stopped

180908 money is just an excuse to avoid thinking very much about the life you are living
180909 while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
180910 all about the beat why hip hop cant save black america
180911 of course obama and his people have to condemn the rap because it does say some vulgar things
180912 if youre running for president youre supposed to be an upstanding individual
180913 theyre thinking an obama who knows how to play the game is still better for me than a mccain
180914 there are a ton of people who clearly are looking for obama to denounce this in order to continue to view him as credible
180915 he for political purposes has to separate himself from anything controversially black
180916 im not aware of hip hop music affecting any election so far and i dont think that this is going to be one either
180917 theres no doubt that hip hop culture moves our young people powerfully and some of it is not just a reflection of reality
180918 it also creates reality i think that if all our kids see is a glorification of materialism and bling and casual sex and kids are never seeing themselves reflected as hitting the books and being responsible and delaying gratification then they are getting an unrealistic picture of what the world is like
180919 lets get free strategies for organizing the hip hop voting bloc
180920 before a lot of the songs about barack were supporting his campaign
180921 this song is different in that it almost claims the victory thats scary for some people who dont want to see that happen
180922 what i was impressed with really was how effective the women in these meetings were
180923 women speaking up getting and using turns in workplace meetings
180924 given that i could see that women were doing a good job and
180925 im not seeing that women are significantly different from men
180926 women questioned more rather than saying things for certain so it was a reflection of womens uncertainty or insecurity
180927 what i found remarkable given the research thats been done on women and language over the last three decades was the power that i could see that questions had for getting someone the chance to speak perhaps even at length
180928 when they really had something to say they thought was going to make a difference
180929 for instance saying something like this may be stating the obvious prefacing what you say by a little bit of a downplaying
180930 its actually an effective thing to do it probably disarms people men do it and women do it
180931 what needs to be challenged are preconceptions and biased evaluations of women and other groups newer to the professional workplace
180932 fussball ist mehr als nur ein sport fussball ist euphorie religion und droge zugleich
180933 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
180934 we are not going to let anybody paint john mccain who has fought his entire life for equal rights for everyone to be able to be painted as racist
180935 weve seen this happen before and were not going to let it happen to us
180936 what barack obama was saying is hes not exactly from central casting for presidential candidates
180937 were not going negative in return were refuting the charges
180938 its a great ad and everybodys talking about it and were having a great time with it
180939 we wanted to add some depth to the bullpen some experience
180940 its a deal we started talking about last weekend and it came together this morning
180941 we felt the opportunity to acquire a young pitcher made sense as we look toward 2009 and beyond
180942 pedro grifol our minor league field coordinator has known gaby for several years and believes he has a chance to help us in the future
180943 we feel good about what were doing right now especially when you win in this fashion a couple days in a row it brings guys right together
180944 i was struggling there at the beginning of the year
180945 i just kept trying to tinker with little things nothing big the stuff hitting coach brian daubach has been telling me has been helping and even teammate mike torres brought something up to me in the cage the other day that helped me out a lot too guys are helping each other out were starting to come together
180946 he wasnt aggressive enough at the plate in the first half of the season
180947 i was telling him swing the bat swing the bat i just wanted him to be more aggressive he was taking too many pitches
180948 were real thin brocktons 31 33 ahead of us and worcester in town tonight is ahead of us they the rox were killing us earlier in the year but now we just took four out of five thats huge
180949 anytime you get some rookies to pump some energy in there its great
180950 its great that theyre having fun because thats what you need and its great burkett and palanski are local kids were thrilled with those guys so far
180951 theyre happy to be here and were happy to have them here
180952 theyre guys we can joke around with they keep it loose in the locker room because theyre so young not that im old but they bring a little life to the team
180953 the kids got good stuff a good curve ball great changeup and he can throw two seamers all day the balls 88 miles an hour and it runs in on hitters hes got a fantastic career ahead of him if he stays healthy hes going to get a chance this year and i know hes going to finish up this year strong if theres scouts that come to the game and see that stuff right there maybe theyll take a chance on him
180954 hes just got to learn to throw more strikes 17 walks in 26 innings and then hell be fine hes got to learn to throw more strikes because then his breaking stuff will be that much better
180955 its been a pretty easy transition i think to where i was at in college to here
180956 its a little tougher being in relief whereas at school i was starting you get into a routine and i knew what i was doing every day here you just have to be ready at all times you dont want to throw too much before the game you want to save it for the game get loose quick and get on the mound quick the hitters here they hit mistakes
180957 as a pitcher you want to get back out there after a bad outing
180958 you dont want to have to think about it for a few days it kind of gets into your head a little bit thats the advantage of relieving ive been working on my changeup a lot trying to keep hitters off balance thats been a big pitch for me since i got here
180959 its been awesome talking with guapo the guys a wealth of knowledge and roper pride pitching coach john
180960 hes 88 91 with some heavy sink on the ball and he competes
180961 nothing fazes him out there which is great im sure hes pumped up excited to be pitching for his home crowd
180962 in a summer ball in virginia in the valley league a collegiate league
180963 its awesome to see local guys succeeding at this level around here its just as good a competition as affiliated ball a lot of these guys could have been in triple a a year ago double a a year ago its still great competition
180964 hes similar to me except hes got a lot harder two seamer
180965 when manny said hed be willing to play in iraq i thought about it
180966 nashua is a beautiful place its a great city its a much better place to play than in iraq
180967 he said i want to go back to the red sox
180968 i need some production in the middle of the lineup
180969 ozzie has the opportunity to field his best team offensively and defensively on a day to day basis over the next two months
180970 and this gives us a chance to keep some of our middle of the order hitters fresh and producing down the stretch
180971 i spoke with ken and he is excited to be coming to chicago to try to help us reach the postseason
180972 i think he was just a little bit surprised maybe but i think he thought about it and said he wanted to talk to his family about it
180973 i think he agreed its a very good opportunity for him and the club obviously wanted him and pursued him and came after him thats got to be a good feeling for him i guess
180974 maybe hes not the player at 38 that he was at 28 but as you saw last night hes still a force on a ballclub and i think hell definitely help the white sox a lot
180975 there was obviously a point in time that you have to make a major decision we did and we were glad we did it hopefully it pays dividends were confident weve got one of the best hitters in baseball coming in here one of the best hitters of his generation from the right side
180976 hes a champion hes a winner and we really couldnt be happier with trying to make the club better at this point in time than to do this we wanted this player at least for the next two months and hopefully longer so were willing to take the chance and go with this guy
180977 we expect him to be here tomorrow and most likely play
180978 theo reached out to me in midmorning and wanted to gauge our interest and i said you know what we have an interest then we probably spent the next two plus hours hammering it out this wasnt on the board for very long
180979 manny being manny can also mean hell hit a lot of home runs and drive in a lot of runs
180980 its nice to see weve done something like this to make a push for the next two months
180981 i think hell be just fine manny is really a simple person he works extremely hard he just wants to play baseball and go home and be with his family how can you not respect and love a guy like that
180982 when a player like manny becomes available i dont think theres a manager in baseball who wouldnt say theyre interested
180983 mannys certainly not a simple personality thats for sure hes complex but ive seen him when he competes
180984 hes one of the greatest hitters ever to play the game its going to be a battle between us starting tonight
180985 the red sox dont deserve a player like me during my years here ive seen how they have mistreated other great players when they didnt want them to try to turn the fans against them
180986 a mans health can be judged by which he takes two at a time pills or stairs
180987 whats damaging the mccain campaign now i suspect is that this fiercely independent man is trying to please other people especially a republican leadership that doesnt really trust him
180988 it can happen here authoritarian peril in the age of bush
180989 better than a thousand hollow words is one word that brings peace

181155 my husband takes his lunch to work and we all eat a lot of sandwiches here
181156 there are things we can do to drive less but how do you eat less you dont
181157 over the years retailers realized that store brands were not just something to be floated out during hard times
181158 all of us are creatures of habit and when things are going well you just buy what you bought last week
181159 customers are much more willing to try a corporate brand when the economy gets tough and when we can get the customer to try it they like it it just makes it so much easier for us to get the customer to try it
181160 just because its a store brand doesnt mean its not the best for your family
181161 at the time we started it no one else was doing it
181162 there wasnt a lot of reliable information out there about the flu
181163 we thought the contributions ought to be put together by everyone because something as wide ranging as a pandemic involves more than just the health department
181164 if you have to close the schools down in a pandemic parents have to know where to pick up their kids they need to know where they can get food and electricity it goes well beyond the virus itself
181165 one of the things we have accomplished is pushing governmental entities to be more transparent
181166 im not sure there would have even been a pandemicflu gov if it hadnt been for our site
181167 this is the wisdom of crowds everyone gets a chance to look at it if theres false information it needs to be corrected
181168 it was started to share information between associates in cardiology
181169 i didnt intend it to be shared throughout the world but it took on a life of its own
181170 its something that has potential to provide up to date medical information
181171 i have a wall of textbooks but sometimes you need more current information a textbook costs us 300 and by the time it comes out its out of date
181172 medicine has lagged behind other professions in its use of technology
181173 whatever we can do to make things more efficient we should do
181174 i wanted to use the power of a wiki for surgical knowledge
181175 doctors need an online resource that they can access at any time in a hospital in the old days they would rely on books but these get out of date and pages go missing so a wiki provides a great opportunity to close that information gap

181180 mobileme has been working perfectly fine for me for the past week or more
181181 syncing between home the mobileme cloud and my work machine is dead
181182 i keep getting inconsistent data despite continually resetting removing restarting mobile me and sync over a number of days im hoping for a second free month from apple for this
181183 every type of publicity has some effect so how big a deal it is its not the end of the universe but its not helpful
181184 in terms of it being expected what you have to look at is apple has a larger and larger footprint in the market and many of its customers are new to computers and as it acquires more consumers its getting the less sophisticated types who dont know the things like on the first day of the service there will be lots of calls and the servers will be overtaxed sophisticated users will tend to know this but the newbies will complain and thatll create bad press
181185 this is the first stumble that apple has made in a pretty long while
181186 i feel that since coo tim cook arrived apple has been executing uncommonly well it could be that apple is seeing some of the limits of growth
181187 as long as nvidia manages good operations and improves in these areas theyve got a stunning range of products for many industries gaming gpus graphic processing units chipsets for pc and mac open gl has always been their strength so open gl or maybe open gl es plays to their advantage were talking physics physx which will probably be integrated into open cl cuda etc
181188 in the desktop portable and even mobile space nvidia has a lot to offer apple as long as quality control is maintained
181189 i dont know much about it but isnt that the point of android that its open source if they want an open source cell phone why dont they just use that

181221 robbie keane really wanted to come and i think he is going to bring us an enormous amount hard work goals and experience
181222 hell bring the level of the team up a notch and im sure hes going to be very important this season
181223 keane has great mobility and versatility he can play on the wing or a bit behind the striker its good for the team to have a player who can get in between the oppositions midfield and defence and score goals hes quick and clever
181224 the tactical lay out of the team is down to rafa when he signed keane he had a clear idea of where he wanted to play him
181225 hes a world class player and hes able to spot passes that maybe other players dont see chances will come along with stevie
181226 hes easy to play with because hes such a good player and i thought we linked up well playing with someone like him can only make my job easier we had a few good moments against villarreal and hopefully that will continue

181253 the subcommittee to investigate the mortal dangers of data collection in the process of serving ads will come to order i will start by asking our first victim sorry i mean witness why it is necessary for online ad companies to collect data on people in order to serve ads
181254 good morning senator esteemed committee and a shout out to the high school kids in the gallery drugged and dragged here by their summer school social studies teachers dont worry kids the air and space museum is this afternoon the fact is senator we dont need any personal user data to serve ads
181255 thats contrary to what we are told by privacy experts
181256 it seems everybody who finds cookie code in their browser files suddenly becomes a privacy expert
181257 at their most basic cookies tell a publisher that a browser on a computer has come onto his site it is assumed a human being launched the browser and made it go to that site that human being needs a new car with better gas mileage he needs whiter teeth and relief from athletes foot he longs for a new credit card or cell plan he cant live without seeing a trailer for the hot new movie opening on friday he might even be looking to hook up with a hot mom in his hometown we give him these things
181258 how do you know what the person behind the browser wants one day he is buying a 2 000 flat screen tv the next day he is buying a crib or maybe the person behind the browser is a 13 year old girl
181259 its pretty simple your lordship we just track where the browser goes and what kind of content its looking at after a while it isnt hard to deduce the gender approximate age and location of that person behind the browser and that is what we sell to advertisers an approximation of who is behind that browser combined with tens of thousands of other browsers that show similar interests
181260 so you cant serve ads unless you track peoples movement all over the web
181261 we dont have to track people to to serve ads next to content that we assume attracts a certain kind of person for example just like advertisers buy football games to target men they buy ads that will run next to online content that attracts men
181262 i wish it was that easy most advertisers dont want their precious little brands next to naked women or especially naked men so no i am talking about things like sports car reviews financial news do it yourself maybe in your case stories about washington call girls
181263 but what about that business with aols search data being used by the new york times to figure out exactly who was doing those searches
181264 valid point the complete defense of course is that it is aol and they screw up everything they touch the search big boys keep those search strings under lock and key
181265 and they never study them to see who is who
181266 dude put a couple of bored 23 year old search tech heads together with some feminized white widow and anything is possible i guess but youd have to be baked or a
181267 are you telling me that the big online advertising companies dont want to know who is who
181268 every year advertisers in the u s spend about 55 billion on tv advertising not knowing anything more about who watches the shows where their ads run other than guesses at age gender and location why do you think the internet needs to know anything more about their audiences if i had the name home and work addresses phone number blood type fingerprints eye color and a rough layout of tattoo locations of everyone on the internet i probably couldnt sell any more advertising than i can with the utterly anonymous age gender and location
181269 but you could then match what people see online with who they actually are right
181270 to what end to open up concentration camps for everyone with aids or who download child porn it would take a company with the size and resources of someone like google to uh never mind

181287 our results for the second quarter highlight the importance of our employees focus on operations and the equally important need to maintain a strong and stable capital position to meet the demands of todays business conditions
181288 along with maintaining strong operations we have completed the sale of the last of our large international assets saesa and recognized a charge associated with our leveraged lease investments these actions impact our discretionary cash position but improve our business risk profile as demonstrated by moodys recent decision to maintain our credit ratings and improve our outlook to stable
181289 this authorization is recognition of the companys solid financials and strong liquidity position the repurchase of our shares may represent the best return for shareholders at this time as we seek to maintain our financial flexibility to pursue higher value opportunities as they become available
181290 strong operations and a largely contracted position continue to support our guidance all with a reduced risk profile

181295 any of the various procedures including the prescription dispensing and administration of any drug or the performance of any procedure or any other action that results in the termination of the life of a human being in utero between conception and natural birth whether before or after implantation
181296 there are forms of abortion post implantation and pre implantation both end a newly formed human life
181297 the pro life medical professional community does not differentiate morally between the two
181298 inconsistent with all established medical authorities and is so broad and inexact that it could include even basic widely used methods of birth control including oral contraception and intrauterine devices
181299 we just passed a birth control proactive measure the compassionate care for rape victims bill that could be very much impacted by this new rule
181300 everybody is aware of the fact that if you were to take this definition seriously you would now make certain forms of birth control functionally equivalent to abortion
181301 it would enhance the argument made by some physicians and pharmacists that they can abandon patients because they oppose abortion and can therefore refuse to fill prescriptions
181302 i dont know enough about it to give you a sic informed answer
181303 i dont usually duck an issue but ill try to get back to you
181304 it is utterly irresponsible for the federal government to hinder womens access to contraceptive services we urge you not to pursue this course of action as it would seriously undermine the access of millions of american women to affordable and effective reproductive health care

181306 reconciliations of gaap results to results excluding certain unusual items
181307 the results of the second quarter were reflective of the current economic environment since joining the company in mid april my focus has been to determine how best to improve both our top and bottom line results
181308 we are focused on developing new product offerings while driving cost efficiencies within our current products our performance for the remainder of the year will be dictated by our ability to recoup through price the raw material cost increases that are presently being incurred by us and the rest of the industry
181309 reconciliations of gaap results to results excluding certain unusual items
181310 this kind of recognition has a two fold impact on our company
181311 in addition to being a source of great pride it fosters a culture of continual achievement we have set the bar high for ourselves and being included among north americas top 100 3pls raises that bar higher inspiring us to further improve our operations and increase the value we offer customers
181312 hard work talented employees and exceptional customer service are three key reasons we have been successful
181313 a fourth may be that weve remained under private ownership guided by executives who have been with the company since its inception this has perhaps enabled us to take a certain amount of risk it has afforded us a little more entrepreneurial leeway in terms of how and where we decide to grow and has helped ensure our decisions are made with our customers best interests at heart
181314 we are delighted that allone and intersections were able to successfully launch their product offering during the second quarter with the launch of the wallet and vault product and the introduction of the mobisecure usbtoken we continue to build our product offering to increase revenue opportunities and enhance our long term shareholder value
181315 the fundamentals of our business continue to strengthen as we achieved our fifth consecutive quarter of double digit revenue growth on strength across our diversified product lines and geographies our prospects for growth have never been better
181316 improving oklahoma education doesnt mean throwing good money after bad
181317 we believe that public school funding is either too high or about right just like the 64 percent of oklahomans that responded to a recent friedman foundation survey
181318 oklahoma schools have enough money its just not being spent wisely
181319 and what do oklahoma students have to show for it
181320 taxpayers shouldnt be forced to throw good money after bad
181321 our schools must spend the dollars we have entrusted to them wisely before they even think about asking for more ultimately all families should have more choices when it comes to what schools their children go to

181331 if the book we are reading does not wake us as with a fist hammering on our skull why then do we read it so that it shall make us happy good god we would also be happy if we had no books and such books as make us happy we could if need be write ourselves but what we must have are those books which come upon us like ill fortune and distress us deeply like the death of one we love better than ourselves like suicide a book must be an ice axe to break the sea frozen inside of us
181332 this rise in exports is a structural shift we are building relations with international partners in which we guarantee constant supply relations beyond the spot market
181333 theres a growing pressure by the american population against the ethanol tariff so we have to be careful not to take a step that could be not that interesting in the future

181341 we remain focused on two items successfully refinancing our debt to provide us with additional liquidity and financial flexibility and achieving operational improvements for improved financial results in the second half of the year
181342 in addition to new business we expect a seasonal pick up in demand in most of our key markets serving the needs of our customers is paramount and key to our success and we fully expect to be able to respond to our customers needs during the seasonal peak of the year we continue to expect second half operating results to improve over the first half but improvement for the full year will be more challenging given rising costs

181358 its tricking the muscle into believing its been exercised daily
181359 it proves you can have a pharmacological equivalent to exercise
181360 why dont people exercise when they know its good for them because its hard you feel fatigued
181361 perhaps a product like this might help people who have a hard time initiating an exercise program
181362 it looks like theyve been able to make fast muscle fibers act more like slow muscle fibers which have a greater capacity to use fats as fuel
181363 who needs to lose a lot of weight or who is at risk of diabetes it may make doing regular submaximal endurance exercise seem easier to people who dont do exercise
181364 if as i suspect people look at it as a substitute for exercise that would be bad news indeed

181382 our primary mission would be to respond to some act of terrorism were going to have a whole bunch of agents here to support us in this division
181383 i would be absolutely delighted if we sent those folks home at the end of the convention having done absolutely nothing
181384 theres no intelligence that identifies any direct act of terrorism
181385 people who are looking to make a statement want to make it when people are looking and people will be looking here
181386 we are very in tune with the constitution we are not going to infringe on peoples first amendment right to protest

181437 montauk monster quickly became the subject of a biographical blog dedicated to his dark materials as well as an autobiographic bildungsroman right here on the huffington post in which our hero explained he had just fallen asleep after reading
181438 with no fancy equipment and by speaking english instead of chef speak
181439 one of the things that factored into this was a guy who has had a great career but has not won a championship and how motivated hes going to be to get on that stage
181440 that is a factor and will always be a factor for me
181441 he said well ive got to tell you i dont know that youre going to see the guy from seattle
181442 i just think theres a lot of added things he can bring
181443 i mean i had posters of that guy on my wall growing up so i think its going to be an awesome thing for all of us
181444 i think he was just a little bit surprised maybe but i think he thought about it and said he wanted to talk to his family about it
181445 i think he agreed its a very good opportunity for him and the club obviously wanted him and pursued him and came after him thats got to be a good feeling for him i guess

181456 where we are today is the result of a development cycle from 18 months ago
181457 18 months ago psp hardware wasnt doing quite as well in terms of sales since then its taken off weve been talking to a lot of developers and really trying to change their thinking about how psp is doing and theyve realized it from what theyve seen at retail
181458 weve told developers to think about how they create the games
181459 because the games they were creating were mostly ports and a lot of consumers were playing it at home and saying well i could play it on a screen like this or i could play it on a smaller screen we dont want to have that competition

181461 theyre going to be a bit of a surprise theyre going to be like wow thats coming to psp

181494 orders for further mine protected vehicle and other land systems contracts have enhanced the groups outlook for 2008

181498 i always personally hope that its basically an olympics about sports but if it isnt going to be sports well be ready for news
181499 the reason why i have not talked about these things until now is because im the person who had to continually deal with chinese officials at the highest levels about being open about stuff
181500 i always felt id be much more effective as a dealer or a negotiator for things like that if i was doing it quietly
181501 you really are going to be the center of attention of the world in a way that youve never been before
181502 this is definitely definitely a much more open relationship than i ever thought it could be seven years ago
181503 they have been incredibly open with us about their security plans
181504 it was important because its an iconic place in this country and the central place you think of the government in beijing

181507 we will see it has been a good circuit for renault in the past but there have been this year some good circuits for us in the past and this year it is not anymore like that so we will see how is this weekend obviously we arrive with some confidence and some optimistic feeling in jerez we found some good solutions it seems so it depends of course how the others improve as well but we should be a little bit better again here
181508 i think more or less the same obviously the target and the goal for the rest of the season is very clear to try to be fourth in the constructors championship now we are sixth but only two points from toyota and one from red bull so the last race with eight points was a big big step for us in terms of confidence and motivation to keep pushing it didnt change too much in the team but now we are closer to our goal
181509 no there is still some developing in this car and some improvements in every race its true also that in jerez in some of the test we were also looking at next years car we were testing with slick tires so it was a good opportunity to test maybe new solutions for next years car but this years car is still the main priority at the moment
181510 i have a contract with renault for the long term but of course at the end of every season you need to look at what the possibilities are it is not the time now in the middle of august to think but for sure in september and october i will have a think and we will decide

181546 at market lows the expectations bar has usually been set sufficiently low for fundamentals to hurdle them even if those fundamentals remain weak in absolute terms

181664 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
181665 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
181666 the mccain campaign was compelled to respond to this outrageous attack because we will not allow john mccain to be smeared by senator obama as a racist for offering legitimate criticism
181667 we have waited for months with a sick feeling knowing this moment would come because we watched it incur with president clinton

181669 obama voters mccain voters they just do not see iraq iran and issues like offshore drilling and cuba the same way
181670 in each case the current 25 of voters that are undecided on the presidential race fall between mccain and obamas supporters on issues on iraq the undecideds are closer to the obama backers on offshore drilling and cuba they lean towards the mccain supporters
181671 although most new yorkers especially john mccains supporters believe it is wiser to be more concerned about al qaeda than global warming a majority especially barack obamas voters would rather devote resources to fighting hunger and disease around the world than concentrate on the wars in iraq and afghanistan
181672 mccains supporters by more than 3 to 1 agree that radical islamic fundamentalism is the greatest danger our country faces in world today but only 35 of obamas backers feel the same way and although a plurality of all new yorkers 42 to 35 feel that the war in afghanistan is more a threat to americans than the war in iraq and that we should increase our military forces in afghanistan there is no real difference between obamas and mccains supporters on this issue

181725 three buses and 21 cars are powered by air products hydrogen fuelling technology
181726 these vehicles will be used to transport athletes and visitors during the beijing olympics the first demonstration project for new clean energy vehicles in china which is a matter close to the heart of the chinese government at this olympics and beyond
181727 if you look at all these electronics devices im sure you will find air products gases or technology are used in the manufacture of those notebook computers that journalists and officials are using at the olympics in the millions of digital cameras being used to capture exciting moments or the lcd tv that people use to watch the games
181728 we have seen the upward trend of gases demand coming from these markets over the last few years the strong market demand is driven by increasing domestic consumption and the olympic games is a factor in this increase
181729 in our view the connection is as great as with all other industries
181730 sports infrastructure as with any other infrastructure requires bricks and mortar to be constructed the building of any structure requires the use of industrial gases the development of roads that lead to the facilities the preparation of raw materials for the structures such as steel and plastics all have a direct link back to industrial gases
181731 the fact that more sports related infrastructure is being constructed leads to a greater demand for industrial gases and praxair is excellently positioned to meet the demands of these new requirements as the leading supplier of gases in china
181732 yes were proud of winning the contracts as we use our leading edge technologies for the benefit of the beijing olympic games and the water treatment industry itself in china
181733 in this way we have also helped the local government to improve the overall water conditions regarding the trend as the leader in water treatment applications praxair china is optimistic about the future prospects of using industrial gases and related technologies in this segment at present praxair china serves over 20 locations in china for their drinking water and wastewater treatment
181734 we see the future needs as a great one as the example that the city of beijing has set will be replicated throughout china we are confident in our continuing leading position in this segment as we begin to commercialise these applications throughout china
181735 it is natural that the olympic games generate more business for the city and country where it is held for example we also supplied the welding gases used in construction of the national stadium birds nest and we will ramp up supply to the beverage industry in preparation for the increased consumption during the games
181736 however the demand for industrial gases comes not just from prominent events like the games but also from development of a city region or an industrial sector praxair china serves a wide variety of industries including chemicals electronics food amp beverage healthcare metals amp metal fabrication and water treatment through the production sale distribution and value added application of industrial gases
181737 our experience tells us that as the basic industrial production of any region expands the use of industrial gases expands at a rate that is one and a half times greater so any increase in growth is good for the industrial gases business

181761 no i never said that if you know manolo lopez he is somewhat aristocratic he would be the last person to wait for somebody in the car and they did not know that he was abroad at that time

181764 and my third comment is he is a lawyer and a justice he knows that a lie detector test is not admissible as evidence so why is he asking for it de borja said
181765 he is a public official being a justice so he must be like caesars wife who must be beyond suspicion and to be beyond suspicion you must be squeaky clean and he is not squeaky clean

181768 nobody is saying the decision is wrong they are just casting doubts on the integrity of the justices in order to cast a shadow on the decision

181773 iran has also tested high altitude explosions of the shihab 3 a test mode consistent with emp attack and described the tests as successful iranian military writings explicitly discuss a nuclear emp attack that would gravely harm the united states
181774 while the commission does not know the intention of iran in conducting these activities we are disturbed by the capability that emerges when we connect the dots
181775 a determined adversary can achieve an emp attack capability without having a high level of sophistication
181776 for example an adversary would not have to have long range ballistic missiles to conduct an emp attack against the united states such an attack could be launched from a freighter off the u s coast using a short or medium range missile to loft a nuclear warhead to high altitude terrorists sponsored by a rogue state could attempt to execute such an attack without revealing the identity of the perpetrators
181777 potentially hostile states such as north korea and iran may also be developing the capability to pose an emp threat to the united states and may also be unpredictable and difficult to deter

181824 wenn das schon parteisch digend ist dann sind es die u erungen des prominenten sozialdemokraten clement gegen andrea ypsilanti wohl erst recht
181825 herr clement darf sich jetzt nicht wundern wenn er mit seinem eigenen ma gemessen wird
181826 es wird momentan durch u erungen vieler prominenter sozialdemokraten eine menge druck ausge bt auf die kommission
181827 die spd und wolfgang clement m ssen einander aushalten dies galt und gilt auch f r manch anderes mitglied der partei f r beide seiten ist das nicht immer leicht aber es dient der sozialdemokratischen sache
181828 ich w nsche mir dass er dies auch k nftig als mitglied der spd aus ihr heraus wird leisten k nnen

181830 we hosted three public open days this year in addition to the prearranged school visits each of these was very well attended with the final open day attracting just over 200 people
181831 many who visited on the last open day were shetlanders home on holiday who really appreciated the opportunity for their children to see some of the sea creatures they themselves were familiar with whilst growing up in shetland
181832 it was also good to see a lot of the school children who had already visited with their schools come back again with older and younger siblings and parents or grandparents

181836 as far as im concerned manny can stay in my guest house
181837 i think as soon as i got here one of the things i told mr vaughn was that we needed to bring new blood in
181838 we needed to rejuvenate our program just start over and get away from the past
181839 i told him that were going to respect and honor whats been set forth here but we want to start our own new traditions and some new things
181840 when we got here we said that everyone was starting from scratch
181841 so that competition is a big part of what were doing thats helped us practice wise because everyone isnt grandfathered into their roles and its wide open and its only going to make us better
181842 we feel like that right now we want to find 22 football players
181843 and with the numbers we have out here right now we should be able to do that and let guys focus on one position

181848 we were ready for a change and its pretty good we want to win
181849 you can take some lessons from the past but i think its more important for us to put the negative stuff behind us

181918 we are constantly pushing the envelope on fea model size and complexity
181919 with algor v22 we have full use of the x64 processor allowing us to mesh and analyze larger and more complex models now we can routinely mesh models with approximately 2 million solid elements and perform linear analysis on those models
181920 algor v22 has allowed us to perform large scale analyses that just werent possible before
181921 my company deals with large models with irregular shaped parts on a routine basis and with v22 we can perform intricate mechanical event simulations with numerous surface to surface contacts additionally we have completed complex 3 d fluid flow studies capturing vortex shedding with v22 that would rival all competitor cfd software
181922 developed in response to user requests v22 provides algor users with increased power flexibility and ease of use for simulating engineering analyses of their product designs v22s capabilities for larger models and additional analysis tools are moving us closer to true virtual prototyping where a person working on a computer can simulate the testing of a product design as realistically as can be physically performed inside a laboratory algor v22 represents another significant step towards achieving that ultimate goal

181939 i chose solidthinking because it offers powerful but intuitive modeling and through its construction history i can keep the project workflow under control
181940 we have been using solidthinking for the last six years to translate our thoughts into three dimensional objects
181941 what we find unique about solidthinking is the ease and flexibility it provides to our product designers its one of the few software applications designed and tailored for product designers it facilitates creativity and minimizes the technical burdens which other three dimensional software applications dont do as well
181942 data storage has become a critical issue impacting every market segment and every business regardless of size off site data centers are a growing component of most enterprise data management architectures due to disk storage prices falling and the reliability administrative issues and costs of tape backup systems continuing to plague it shops
181943 with the launch of our data center connectivity services were proud to provide our clients the type of flexible bandwidth low latency communications needed to remain on plan with their data center connectivity initiatives
181944 the result a resounding cry to move to ethernet it looked like the respondees were going to triple their investment over the next several years
181945 the most complicated part of delivering the remote data center solutions that cervalis offers to the marketplace is getting and staying connected the high reliability and availability of optimum lightpaths point to point ethernet connectivity solution is essential to our business

181950 we have identified the major risks and taken actions to address them particularly in the u s market
181951 in the second quarter demand for oil remained robust driven by continued growth in asia and the middle east and despite signs of a slowdown in the atlantic basin
181952 there is no surprise but the main element is that the tax level is a bit lower
181953 they are heavily denting purchasing power and eroding the income gains generated by more jobs and higher wages to make things worse german consumers have been losing faith in the sustainability of the strong economic momentum
181954 growth and oil demand is slowing in the u s europe and japan and its too optimistic to think emerging market demand will compensate for that
181955 we have always had an understanding and we havent necessarily talked about it that any sovereign government will block pornographic sites and what they might consider subversive or sites which are contrary to the national interest
181956 i would suggest also that we are not working in a democratic society were working in a communist society this is china and they are proud to be a communist society so it will be different
181957 i believe we are now on the way to getting there
181958 business conditions for the automobile industry deteriorated sharply again in the second quarter due to further ongoing steep rises in oil and raw material prices the weakness of the u s dollar the impact of the international financial crisis and a weaker u s economy
181959 we now expect that the pretax return on sales for the year to be at least 4 per cent
181960 significantly holding down earnings for the first half of the year
181961 given the challenging sales environment we are pleased with our second quarter earnings results which came in at the high end of our expectations on an operational basis but were impacted by the one time charge relating to lease accounting
181962 in the second quarter demand for oil remained robust driven by continued growth in asia and the middle east and despite signs of a slowdown in the atlantic basin
181963 there is no surprise but the main element is that the tax level is a bit lower
181964 the xo5166 xo5167 series provides full stratum 3 compliance to all telcordia requirements
181965 mtronptis new xo5166 xo5167 series offers an ideal alternative to some similar products in the marketplace
181966 the advantage of our product is that it utilizes better more proven production processes resulting in better quality shorter leadtimes and is very price competitive
181967 barcelona is not interested in this player its a great player but we already have our team almost in place

181971 our automatic balancing valve is unique because it is externally adjustable
181972 unlike other balancing valves which have a fixed gpm gallons per minute and have to be removed from a shut down system if a change is needed ours can be changed externally to one of 40 different flow rates by simply turning a control valve with a special key
181973 what this means for the building owner or contractor is that when the needs of building tenants change the cost and ease of changing the flow rate is extremely low compared to other flow control products
181974 initial discussions with several leading u s and canadian manufacturers and distributors have been very promising
181975 we believe that the unique qualities which made flowcon the preferred balancing valves internationally will soon also make them the preferred choice in north america
181976 compliance has penetrated every department of a business from hr finance and legal through to marketing and the supply chain failing to comply with legal and regulatory obligations such as fcpa foreign corrupt practices act and anti discrimination legislation is a significant operational risk issue and grace is designed to enable our customers to considerably reduce this risk
181977 firstly valued it resource is diverted from delivering innovation back into the business subsequently impacting that organisations commercial and competitive development and secondly it staff can quickly become disillusioned and dissatisfied by mundane operational tasks resulting in employee churn implementing automated software that can multi manage compliance policies will enable it departments to get on with what they are challenged daily by stakeholders to do innovate to improve profits
181978 the automated nature of grace ensures that policies continuously evolve and adapt to industry and company changes this not only helps organisations avoid the financial impact of contravening compliance measures but the automated upgrades which require user consent increases awareness across the business
181979 the obvious use of the talklets service is to satisfy increasingly stringent accessibility requirements which are mandated in legislation around the world
181980 website owners need to start thinking how they can use talklets to extract maximum value from the text based assets they have invested in the combination of the software as a service model and natural speech means that services can be delivered effortlessly and be completely brand specific theres no reason why we couldnt have murray walker voicing motor racing sites david frost reading news portals or kate moss reading fashion tips the initial indications we have from our trials suggest that making text more flexible and accessible offers considerable long term benefits by attracting new audiences increasing engagement and extending user stickiness
181981 customers now using the sh72546rfcc software development mcu that we introduced last year can directly use the system hardware programs and other design assets they have developed transitions of such assets to the sh72544r mcu will be quick and seamless leading edge powertrain control system designs that take full advantage of the capabilities and features of our new chip can provide smooth and outstanding engine and transmission performance while delivering enhanced mileage with fewer emissions
181982 take part in any activity that disturbs post earthquake reconstruction

181984 these are not comprehensive or full scope safeguards unlike with npt member states
181985 but it satisfies indias needs while maintaining all the agencys legal requirements
181986 as with other safeguards agreements between the agency and member states the agreement is of indefinite duration there are no conditions for discontinuation other than those provided by the safeguards agreement itself

182056 seed stage investing where there is significant development needed has put too much time pressure on our return profile

182077 harriet miers is not immune from compelled congressional process she is legally required to testify pursuant to a duly issued congressional subpoena
182078 my jaw dropped when the doctors told me that 41 percent of the female veterans seen there say they were victims of sexual assault while serving in the military
182079 twenty nine percent say they were raped during their military service they spoke of their continued terror feelings of helplessness and downward spirals many of their lives have taken since
182080 women serving in the u s military today are more likely to be raped by a fellow soldier than killed by enemy fire in iraq
182081 i dont know what youre trying to cover up here but were not going to allow it
182082 the defense department appears to be willfully and blatantly advising dr whitley not to comply with a duly authorized congressional subpoena
182083 even one sexual assault violates the very essence of what it means to be a soldier and its a betrayal of the armys core values
182084 i believe that maria would be alive today if the marines had provided a more effective system to protect the victims of sexual assault
182085 the victim should not have the burden to generate evidence for the command
182086 maria is dead but there will be many more victims in the future i promise you im here to ask you to do what you can to help change how the military treats victims of crime and to ensure the victims receive the support and protection they need and they deserve
182087 occurrences of sexual assault may be exceeding the rates being reported
182088 at the 14 installations where gao administered its survey 103 service members indicated that they had been sexually assaulted within the preceding 12 months of these 52 service members indicated that they did not report the sexual assault
182089 left unchecked these challenges can discourage or prevent some service members from using the programs when needed
182090 whats at stake here goes to the very core of the values of the military and the nation itself
182091 when our sons and daughters put their lives on the line to defend the rest of us the last thing they should fear is being attacked by one of our own

182098 open wide the way for marital infidelity and a general lowering of moral standards
182099 those of us who choose not to settle in hopes of finding a soul mate later are almost like teenagers who believe theyre invulnerable to dying in a drunk driving accident we lose sight of our mortality we forget that we too will age and become less alluring and even if some men do find us engaging and theyre ready to have a family theyll likely decide to marry someone younger with whom they can have their own biological children which is all the more reason to settle before settling is no longer an option
182100 contraception has released males to a historically unprecedented degree from responsibility for their sexual aggression
182101 in an ironic turn american evangelicals are rethinking birth control even as a majority of the nations roman catholics indicate a rejection of their churchs teaching
182102 i cannot imagine any development in human history after the fall that has had a greater impact on human beings than the pill the entire horizon of the sexual act changes i think there can be no question that the pill gave incredible license to everything from adultery and affairs to premarital sex and within marriage to a separation of the sex act and procreation

182126 this is a wonderful award its really the great people at metroland that make it possible for me to win it
182127 its a great industry and i really appreciate the chance to be recognized for having contributed something to the industry
182128 in a world where pundits regularly predict doom and gloom for the newspaper industry murray skinner exudes optimism that community media will be the leading force in news and information for many years to come
182129 although we had many very qualified nominations for this years award one stood out above the rest
182130 murray skinner is a true pioneer in our industry among other tremendous accomplishments the development of the quality distribution program at metroland has become the gold standard that advertisers request and many other newspapers emulate murray has been very generous in sharing his expertise and success formulas with newspaper companies throughout north america i am very pleased to have had the honour of informing murray skinner that he is this years recipient of this very prestigious award no one is more deserving
182131 the collective effect of these restrictions is to make any meaningful participation by the aclu impossible indeed allowing third parties to use this court as a general forum to present facial challenges to the governments surveillance activities could cause a flood of litigation that would district this court from its important national security functions
182132 if the governments request is granted the court wont hear arguments from anyone except the government and those arguments will be presented to the court in secret briefs especially because the new surveillance law departs so significantly from the standards that have applied to government surveillance for the last 30 years any proceedings relating to the new laws constitutionality should be adversarial and as informed and transparent as possible
182133 the doj is taking an expansive view of executive power and narrow view of judicial power swire told tpmmuckraker in an interview today
182134 under the governments view the judges seem required to uphold an unconstitutional system because the judges are forbidden from getting briefing from anyone other than the executive branch
182135 the 1978 version of fisa targeted one individual at a time or sometime one terrorist organization the new approach sweeps far more broadly and it looks more like an administrative system than a traditional judicial wiretap order
182136 in light of those changes and the constitutional challenges to those changes the court would be well served to be briefed with multiple viewpoints
182137 the doj is taking an expansive view of executive power and narrow view of judicial power swire told tpmmuckraker in an interview today
182138 new private sector camera feeds will provide first responders and homeland security officials with additional points of contact throughout the city that can be viewed during an emergency
182139 you see surveillance cameras on the streets in schools in buses to inter connect all of those systems with private systems really raises a question a city that has such pervasive surveillance sends the message that government is looking at them or has the potential to look at them wherever they are
182140 its voluntary thats where the business community believes it should be
182141 in retrospect although my concern for biosafety was honest and my desire to refrain from crying wolf was sincere i should have notified my supervisor ahead of time of my worries about a possible breach in biocontainment
182142 i thought that quietly and diligently cleaning the dirty desk area would both eliminate any possible anthrax contamination as well as prevent unintended anxiety at the institute
182143 with oil now hovering around 125 per barrel about five times what it was five years ago and iraqs oil production at record levels sigir estimates that oil revenues for 2008 could exceed 70 billion
182144 they certainly have the resources to invest in their infrastructure program
182145 i think we ought to just take them at their word on that and focus on helping iraq carry out its own program funded by its own money
182146 a lot of that money is going to be left unspent
182147 given that was going on earlier this year and that we have this massive windfall occurring inevitably there has to be concerns about corruption with regards to those funds
182148 the summer antiques sale at sherway gardens offers many temptations from tantalizing textiles and spectacular art to one of a kind pieces that are sure to whet the casual shoppers appetite
182149 for those with more refined tastes such as avid collectors they will find the creme de la creme of antiques and collectibles displayed on hundreds and hundreds of glittering glass shelves
182150 this is part of the ongoing attraction of the show
182151 our top notch dealers know what is hot in the market at any given time they also know what the decorating crowd is hungry for chances are that if you see a juicy vintage look featured in a magazine you will also see it on the show floor
182152 any accusations against a journalist should be aired publicly and dealt with fairly and swiftly with the journalist having the right to counsel and present a defense
182153 iraqi journalists like mashhadani play a vital role in telling this story to the world
182154 we were concerned to hear of mashhadanis detention and urge the u s military to disclose as a matter of urgency the grounds on which he is being held and what charges if any he faces
182155 dealt with fairly and swiftly with the journalist having the right to counsel and present a defense
182156 iraqi journalists like mashhadani play a vital role in telling this story to the world
182157 disclose as a matter of urgency the grounds on which he is being held and what charges if any he faces
182158 being detained in guantanamo bay is undoubtedly an unpleasant highly regimented experience with instant rewards or loss of privileges for infractions
182159 i hope that the american public will someday hear mr hamdans defense
182160 the jihad must remain expelling the jews and christians killing the jews and christians and expelling them from the arabian peninsula

182171 there has been a surge in the number of civilian casualties caused by all sides a spread of insecurity to previously stable areas and increasing attacks on aid agencies and their staff
182172 so far this year the number of insurgent attacks bombings and other violent incidents is up by approximately 50 per cent on the same period last year the number of insurgent attacks for each of the months of may 463 june 569 and july is greater than the number of such attacks in any other month since the end of major hostilities following the international intervention in 2001
182173 this year 2 500 people have reportedly lost their lives in the conflict and whilst exact figures are not yet available this could include up to 1 000 civilians
182174 according to initial estimates there have been more than 260 civilian casualties in july of this year higher than any other month in the past six years
182175 the increased number of air strikes by international military forces which are up by approximately 40 per cent on last year has also contributed to the rising civilian death toll
182176 insecurity has spread to areas which were previously relatively stable in parts of north north west and central afghan istan including to provinces close to and bordering kabul
182177 the humanitarian challenge in afghanistan continues to grow in the past six months alone criminal gangs have attacked 12 un humanitarian convoys resulting in the loss of food for thousands of the poorest families
182178 the overall view is that we are seeing more violence but pretty much in the same places some times it expands into new areas but when it does it tends to be temporary
182179 we have gone from 30 000 to 50 000 troops and we are generating more activity because we are taking on the insurgents
182180 a large proportion of the violence has been caused by cross border activity
182181 this year it has become even easier for the insurgents to move across the border from pakistan which they are able to use as a safe haven
182182 transportation security specialist pitt declined to discuss her job responsibilities her length of employment with the federal agency or her salary

182184 belligerent aggressive employee who abused her position and billed the state for thousands of dollars in excessive compensation for airfare hotels mileage and personal cell phone calls
182185 activities that cannot withstand public scrutiny without embarrassment do not safeguard the public trust in the integrity of mndot and undermine public trust in the department

182187 traditionally the motor is housed within in the machine while the drive module and controller if used are housed in an external control cabinet requiring that a motor cable run from the control cabinet to the motor because the stm is a combined drive and motor unit the only additional requirement for operation is that power be supplied which is likely already distributed around the machine to other devices the result is that the stm can provide significant savings on control cabinet space along with simplified wiring
182188 we want people to know that the program is not right for everyone

182190 marks the companys largest in history so politicians and consumers are likely to express outrage in face of record gasoline prices
182191 at the same time exxonmobil shareholders are disappointed with the earnings
182192 were partly offset by lower refining and chemical margins lower production volumes and higher operating costs
182193 while big oil is making record profits american families are paying record prices at the pump and our economy is leaving working people behind
182194 for far too long weve had an energy policy that has worked for the oil companies barack obama is calling for an energy policy that works for the american people and thats a change that we cant wait any longer to make
182195 repo is above eonia meaning collaterized is trading above uncollateralized lending which is expected for quarter end because banks in order to make their balance sheets look better do not wish to hold assets that are not essential to their operations
182196 but the point is that it has continued though the spread has narrowed but it still remains and that is strange
182197 a lot of the repo desks are very constrained with what they can do with their bonds these days and thats just locking up the market to the extent that the old relationships between secured and unsecured lending have completely broken down
182198 the experience of bear stearns has shown that a financial institution may suddenly find itself unable to borrow money even against sound collateral to protect themselves against such a contingency holders of collateral have been willing to use that collateral to borrow money for term even at rates higher than the expected overnight rate
182199 its a price worth paying to reduce exposure to the risk that liquidity dries up overnight
182200 the independence arena through the ministry of works and transport has been leased to oruuano artists union for use by namibian artists this shows the commitment of the government in developing the arts and culture industry through artists themselves
182201 i have no doubt that namibian artists will take full advantage to develop the independence arena into a functional entertainment centre and create wealth for themselves and the industry
182202 music to me is a combination of rhythms and coordinated sounds with its powers music is a tool than can unite entertain educate and heal the community therefore artists unions should act in the national interest and contribute towards the economic development and the common good of the country
182203 namibia is blessed with a rich and diverse cultural and traditional heritage of artists ranging from storytellers poets musicians and traditional dancers i believe there is tremendous potential if we put our act together and actively promote the link between art and tourism
182204 we at bank windhoek are very excited about this commissioned work with respected names like prof aldo behrens ena venter and her mascato choir this production promises to be a major success once again bank windhoek assisted to create a platform for the performing arts to showcase its quality bank windhoek is the single biggest contributor to arts in namibia

182213 our new air intelliflow dual rate system represents the evolution of our product line to meet the growing sophistication and demands of the aerial application market
182214 air intelliflow dual rate eliminates the limitations of single flow variable rate controllers allowing our customers to be more productive and effective
182215 when using a traditional variable rate system as i change the rate the system simply releases more or less liquid which creates droplets that may be too heavy or too light resulting in a less than perfect spray job
182216 the air intelliflow dual rate maintains an ideal droplet size significantly improving the spray efficacy and minimizing its drift
182217 with increasing demand for anytime anywhere computing vnc enterprise edition 4 4 delivers powerful cross platform access and control for both experienced and non technical users

182225 but they go and get another doctor and say come and look at her
182226 and then to be able to still be independent and essentially not require a lot of assistance we should be taking blood samples and figuring out what they did right and why their genes are so much better than the rest of ours

182260 a lot is happening behind the scenes we have been meeting with congressmen a lot
182261 last time we checked they had put it before the congress and they denied it but we are still fighting
182262 they might turn it into a museum or just dock it somewhere in new orleans
182263 its really hard to say what they are going to do with it
182264 theres a lot of crew members and a lot of passengers that really dont want to see this boat go
182265 is based almost entirely on recovering increased costs and modernizing our facilities to keep them reliable

182267 were looking for a decision on the proposed rates by the end of this year
182268 since january 2003 the price of the coal we use is up by 293 percent and natural gas prices have increased 138 percent since 2003
182269 what we pay for those fuels is a pass through cost to the customer we make no money on that
182270 im retired on a fixed income and my electric bill is already extremely high
182271 i know they have to increase rates to pay employees and make improvements but this would be too much
182272 i am a dj i started my career as a dj and a collector of records
182273 the million dj march speaks to the longevity of the dj community if deejaying is going to survive in to the future we are going to have to take it a little more seriously than just a party past time

182388 im not sure too many people expected us to make the playoffs this year but this was a young team that for the most part really played well together
182389 it was a tough way to the end the season but the coaching staff is proud of the way these kids played

182408 we educate our community on the rules and include a direct link from every youtube page to make this process as easy as possible for our users

182515 we are increasingly being asked to supply and integrate the smart card and biometric solutions they specialise in particularly by our bsf clients with growing demand for these technologies it makes sense to have this kind of capability within the group
182516 we recommend that proactive review of content should be standard practice for sites hosting user generated content
182517 even if review of every bit of content is not practical that is not an argument to undertake none at all
182518 we are also concerned that user generated video content on sites such as youtube does not carry any age classification nor is there a watershed before which it cannot be viewed

182528 in pursuit of happiness research is it reliable what does it imply for policy
182529 that formulation life liberty and the pursuit of happiness indicated a common assumption about the relationship between those things
182530 in order to achieve happiness obviously you need to be secure in your physical life dead people arent happy but the main means to happiness is liberty
182531 some of the economists who do happiness research fall into the trap of thinking that happiness is the sole value according to which were going to measure the success or failure of any initiative
182532 friendship and sociality are as important as anything else for happiness
182533 so unless we can find a group of people we enjoy as much in iowa city as we have here we might be a little less happy
182534 the difference between say a liberaltarian or a market liberal and a traditional egalitarian liberal is a sense of what kinds of institutions are going to deliver the goods for the least well off in society
182535 the question is always how do you design those programs in a way that doesnt discourage work and doesnt encourage dependency
182536 societies that have relatively free markets high levels of personal liberty and high rates of economic growth are the places where people are in fact the happiest
182537 i dont care about the same thing that conservatives care about
182538 a certain kind of commitment to an economically literate conception of a well designed welfare state is a part of the 20th century libertarian tradition

182550 people really thought the non farm payrolls number for july was going to be bad number
182551 so not only was the latest number 20 25 000 better than expected but the prior two months were revised up so its not a good number but its not as bad as expected
182552 this figure might not be as weak as expected but it is still painful
182553 there is no doubt that false and damaging rumours were circulating about hbos on march 19 and these would have had some impact on hbos share price it is difficult to say how much impact as the share price was also affected by the interaction of a number of other complex factors on the day
182554 this will not always uncover evidence of market abuse nor lead to enforcement action
182555 market participants should however expect that our surveillance and investigation activity will continue at a high level of intensity
182556 specifically we are examining what policies are in place and how firms ensure compliance with them whether and how rumours are verified whether traders are permitted to pass on or trade on rumours and how firms ensure firms do not initiate to spread false rumours

182560 on thursday of playing the race card citing his remarks that republicans would try to scare voters by pointing out that he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
182561 im very disappointed and race will not have any role on my campaign nor is there any place for it and im disappointed that hes using it
182562 today mccains campaign manager used even stronger language accusing obama of playing the race card he played it from the bottom of the deck said rick davis its divisive negative shameful and wrong but this afternoon obama campaign manager david plouffe denied outright that obama was making a racial charge
182563 we werent suggesting in any way hes using race as an issue
182564 youd think that wed be having a serious debate but so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton and britney spears i do have to ask my opponent is that the best you can come up with
182565 all i can say that were proud of that commercial
182566 it has become apparent in the past two days that mccain intends as a strategy to criticize obama often and hard
182567 what mccain seems determined to do is define obama on his own terms raise some doubts and maybe by process of elimination you win but its a risky strategy
182568 the risk for mccain some say it could hurt his good guy image
182569 mccain wants the presidential campaign to be about barack obama thats why he talks about him so much to that end mccain is helping frame a not so flattering portrait of obama for voters his ads have become increasingly tough a third of his commercials portray obama negatively a new study concluded
182570 to the growing negative tone of the general election campaign
182571 called the latest punches from the mccain camp character attacks and said the campaign has opened a new web site lowroadexpress
182572 mccains tone has become harsher after extensive media coverage of mr obamas overseas trip and after changes within the campaign
182573 aides say their goal is to pre empt what they believe is obamas effort to paint any conventional campaign attacks as race based obamas aim in the view of the mccain camp to delegitimize any line of attack against him said mccain aide steve schmidt he said he saw that potential trap being sprung when
182574 seized on a record oil company profit to argue that rival john mccain offers only tax breaks for big oil and short term gimmicks to consumers struggling with soaring gasoline prices
182575 quickly incorporated news of exxon mobils nearly 12 billion quarterly profit into his remarks at a town hall meeting
182576 called for reform of the nations energy economy accusing president bush of letting the oil companies write his oil policy and promising to send americans gasoline rebate checks double automobile fuel efficiency standards and wean the united states from dependence on foreign oil
182577 collected more than 1 5 million in campaign funding thursday night in two houston neighborhoods built by oil and natural gas profits while telling his audiences that america needs to liberate itself from those fuels picture this standing on a platform just above the water level of a lighted indoor pool at a memorial home obama said the nation needs to develop wind and solar energy and other alternative sources he spoke to about 55 paying guests at candlelit round dinner tables under skylights in the 18 000 square foot home of john thrash chief of a natural gas infrastructure company and wife becca cason thrash
182578 growing popularity among women is fueling speculation that he will select a female running mate ripening talk about conservative favorite sarah palin governor of alaska and former hewlett packard chief executive officer carly fiorina one of his top economic advisers
182579 even some democrats say putting a dynamic woman on the republican ballot would tip independents especially the security moms who helped president bush win re election in 2004

182585 is mobilizing its store managers and department supervisors around the country to warn that if democrats win power in november theyll likely change federal law to make it easier for workers to unionize companies including wal mart
182586 have been summoned to mandatory meetings at which the retailer stresses the downside for workers if stores were to be unionized
182587 expanded more slowly than expected from april to june the government reported thursday while numbers for the last three months of 2007 were revised downward to show a contraction the first official slide backward since the last recession in 2001
182588 recession worries linger as gdp rises a scant 1 9
182589 the economy contracted at a 0 2 rate in the final months of 2007 its worst showing since the 2001 recession
182590 grew at a modest pace in the second quarter due to strong exports and government stimulus checks but a faltering labor market signaled there may be worse news to come
182591 faster than earlier in the year but slower than economists were expecting
182592 the government now says the economy was receding not growing in the final quarter of last year it picked up a bit in the first quarter of this year but in the second quarter when all these rebate checks were supposed to stimulate the economy it grew less than 2
182593 armed with government stimulus checks of up to 600 per person americans boosted spending on food clothing and other items in the second quarter the commerce department reported but the gross domestic product still increased less than the 2 4 percent economists were looking for
182594 a tale of two economies one propelled by robust growth in exports tied to strongly emerging markets overseas the other mired in recession as consumers at home struggle to cope with record high debts soaring energy prices and falling home prices
182595 the us economy doubled its first quarter rate of growth to 1 9 percent from april through june and some signs emerged that the us economy may have bottomed out
182596 grew at a solid pace despite being buffeted by a financial crisis a deep housing slump high fuel prices and a weak job market
182597 us treasury secretary henry paulson thursday said new economic data prove that the economic stimulus plan has successfully propped up the us economy but said it will take additional months for the housing market the biggest risk to the economy to fully recover
182598 he expects moderate growth in the us economy this year and some stability returning to the housing market in a matter of months
182599 the weakness in us economic growth which mustered an annualized 1 9 percent pace in the second quarter has sparked talk about a second stimulus package ahead of the november presidential election a number of democrats back the idea including the speaker of the house of representatives nancy pelosi
182600 wall street sank thursday after weak readings on economic growth and the job market touched off renewed concerns about the financial health of businesses and consumers
182601 could not shake off its worries about the economy particularly after sobering remarks from former federal reserve chairman alan greenspan on cnbc late in the afternoon greenspan said he would be more surprised if the united states did not enter recession than if it did
182602 fell 205 67 or 1 78 percent to 11 378 02 continuing its string of erratic triple digit daily swings
182603 bush said july was a month of encouraging news from iraq
182604 violence is down to levels not seen since the spring of 2004 and the improvements are becoming consistent
182605 made good on an earlier promise confirming that starting tomorrow combat tours for troops heading to iraq and afghanistan will now be reduced from 15 months back to 12
182606 falling violence levels in iraq should allow troop withdrawals there to continue
182607 progress in iraq while potentially reversible has a degree of durability
182608 appeared to lay the groundwork for an announcement in coming weeks of further us troop reductions
182609 some read that as a hint from the president that troop reductions are imminent but secretary gates wasnt ready to pre empt general petraeuss recommendation
182610 bush and his aides have been reluctant to declare the sharp drop in ethnic and sectarian violence over the last year as irreversible still he gave the clearest indication yet that conditions in iraq would allow him to begin reducing the number of american troops there before he leaves office in less than six months
182611 the commanding general of day to day operations of the war iraq hasnt yet reached the point of sustainable security many in the leaders of al qaida in iraq have departed as have militant shiite leaders whore now believed to be hiding in iran but they dont plan to stay abroad austin said
182612 soldiers cant afford to let their guards down iraq may be quieter
182613 gen david petraeus is determined not to declare victory early
182614 while the number of us casualties in iraq is declining the number in afghanistan continues to rise 16 us troops were killed in afghanistan in july thats the second highest monthly total since the war began
182615 rejected the bush administrations sweeping assertion of executive privilege and ruled that two white house aides must answer subpoenas from congress
182616 said that the aides could cite executive privilege and refuse to answer specific questions once they were in front of congress
182617 the ruling by us district judge john d bates doesnt settle the larger question of whether
182618 can assert executive privilege to refuse to respond to specific questions from congress
182619 a blow to the bush administrations efforts to bolster the power of the executive branch at the expense of the legislative branch
182620 would be required to cooperate with the house judiciary committee which has been investigating the controversial dismissal of the federal prosecutors in 2006
182621 batess decision will likely not end the squabble the justice department which represents the white house is expected to appeal officials with the committee and the justice department could not be reached for comment
182622 said the ruling could give congress a new impetus to hold rove in contempt
182623 president bush says hes using his last six months in office to push new energy plans that include electricity from coal
182624 the west virginia coal association gathered at the greenbrier resort
182625 reliable sources of electricity must be part of a strong economy and there is no more reliable source of electricity than coal
182626 took another shot today at enticing cajoling or shaming democratic lawmakers into doing something about the energy crunch once again there was much more talk than action on capitol hill and the stumbling block continues to be the republican call for new domestic oil drilling
182627 insisted his administration has been pushing a variety of new energy plans including clean coal technology and will continue to do so for the third straight day he said when it comes to oil and natural gas congress wont allow votes on practical solutions like domestic drilling
182628 as congress begins a five week break without passing legislation to address high gasoline prices democrats and republicans are fighting for the political high ground in the energy debate
182629 flurry of ads and on the campaign trail republicans are pounding democrats for failing to allow votes on lifting a federal ban on oil and gas drilling in offshore areas to boost domestic production
182630 are accusing republicans of blocking renewable energy initiatives and protecting wealthy oil companies at consumers expense
182631 democrats will head into the august recess friday with the shadow of gas prices hanging over them following a mix up about whether house speaker nancy pelosi d calif had hinted that she might allow a vote on new oil drilling
182632 struggles to cope with the energy crisis threaten to obscure a string of victories it has racked up on other domestic issues such as housing medicare unemployment and veterans benefits
182633 with gas prices hovering at 4 a gallon a majority of floridians now support drilling for oil in protected areas offshore according to a new poll the survey finds support for drilling at 60 percent with 10 percent of respondents telling pollsters that theyd opposed offshore drilling in the past thirty six percent of respondents said they remain opposed to offshore drilling
182634 well the campaigns starting to get nasty have you seen the new commercial the mccain campaign compares barack obama to britney spears and paris hilton and today the obama campaign released an ad comparing john mccain to zsa zsa gabor and bea arthur
182635 obamas people are trying to portray mccain as cranky and mccain is trying to portray obama as arrogant you see
182636 and when mccain was asked about being labeled cranky he told the reporter to go to hell
182637 in a speech yesterday barack obama said hes distantly related to the famous 19th century gunslinger wild bill hickock after hearing this john mccain said big deal i went to high school with him
182638 president bush is on the hunt for a new home i guess his master plan of massive foreclosures and plummeting real estate prices has finally paid off because he should get a good deal
182639 every time i think about him training i feel so sad that my heart hurts for him and for me there is so much pain
182640 i have been kicked and slapped when i didnt try hard enough it hurts and i cry sometimes but next time i try harder
182641 its difficult its hard we do beat ourselves up but you know thats what makes us one of the best motorsports in the entire world we take it personal when we see things we know we can fix were going to go fix them thats what were going to set out to do were going to put this behind us
182642 one of the things that we have learned we need to test the current cars the cars with the current engines the best horsepower and you need to test with the best drivers that you can
182643 next year will be a different set of circumstances and the test policy will be a little more wide open where teams can hit the places they need to hit but right now were not going to change where were at
182644 there is nothing worse than coming away from a race and knowing that the result wasnt even close
182645 it wasnt even close it wasnt even in the 25th percentile of what were capable of doing and what we do week in and week out
182646 sport is really important for us in iraq right now
182647 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
182648 phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good so we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on mars
182649 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind
182650 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
182651 with no exercise you can take a drug and chemically mimic it
182652 honestly i just dont know how that happens whether it would happen in a person i dont know i think its a small miracle it happened at all
182653 it would be better to do exercise than to take a pill
182654 we have always had an understanding and we havent necessarily talked about it that any sovereign government will block pornographic sites and what they might consider subversive or sites which are contrary to the national interest
182655 i would suggest also that we are not working in a democratic society were working in a communist society this is
182656 i believe we are now on the way to getting there
182657 i just got the message early this morning that everything had opened up and im very happy about that
182658 and were keeping our promises when bidding for the games to provide good environment and a quality service for reporters using the internet to cover the olympic games and we administer the internet by law
182659 i have absolute assurance from the president of the ioc that no new arrangements have been entered into with the local organizing committee bocog or the chinese authorities in respect to censorship for the international press to report on the games
182660 one of the oldest types of energy used by people is muscular energy so this is nothing new
182661 i disconnected the resistor and started storing the energy into a battery that is then used as power it was a way to show there can be very simple solutions it doesnt always have to be high tech
182662 this is just the first version we are willing to take it further
182663 we receive a lot of requests from other companies for people who want to use the floors we get many of these for bus and train stations places where there are lots of people
182664 i think its a science field which will be one of the future
182665 with so many kids not exercising enough a battery could be created for these devices so they had to create the energy to use them the same could be done for television sets
182666 we could get the situation where people have to cycle so they can use it
182667 its a very good marketing tool for businesses but it terms of economics it does not make sense at all
182668 the project dance floor in itself doesnt save a lot of energy its more of a statement than anything
182669 the sensor we are developing certainly has many possible applications
182670 a dog takes a lot of training and a person has to be with them all of the time a dog doesnt work 7 days a week and maybe will get into a bad mood
182671 the end result is he is happy go out and work because of his loyalty to you each dog has a different personality
182672 i love the art of hip hop i dont always love the message of hip hop
182673 there are times where even with the artists i love you know theres a message that is not only sometimes degrading to women not only uses the n word a little too frequently but also something im really concerned about its always talking about material things
182674 while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
182675 neil brings a wealth of experience to the coo role he offers invaluable expertise in both domestic and international operations along with a proven track record for developing and executing growth initiatives
182676 neil is the right manager for emss operations as we navigate through the current economic challenges and prepare ourselves for the enormous opportunities ahead
182677 i look forward to working closely with our ems business units in my new role
182678 its an exciting time to be at ems as the company continues to build on its technical capabilities and market presence in key areas of satellite communications military comms on the move and the wireless mobile logistics market

182686 schalke ist sicherlich nicht der beste aber auch nicht der schlechteste gegner f r uns tatsache ist dass das r ckspiel in madrid ist und das ist ein vorteil f r uns
182687 what the chinese tried to do was infiltrate their security to see who in china the tibet movement was talking to
182688 a lot of places in the world including china dont have the same view of personal space and privacy that we do in the united states
182689 youve got to suspect that every place youre doing work is being monitored and being watched

182692 i got exactly what i wanted out of the deal the true facts of the situation
182693 i feel a lot better knowing that under oath nelson said that during dallas nba finals games in 2006 that he was meeting with golden states gm and helping the warriors work on their draft plans
182694 unfortunately according to the arbitrator because i held back about 25 000 in consulting payments as i tried to understand the situation i am obligated to pay him the deferred money he was to be paid basically i pay him the exact same amount i would have paid him had this not happened
182695 i can live with that it was all worth the hassle to find out what really happened
182696 not so much a legal defeat for cuban as it was an old fashioned ass whuppin
182697 its a good day im relieved it ended the way it did i didnt think i would lose and i didnt think he would win but you just never know when you go to court
182698 it was kind of a silly case its like a pimple on his behind for cuban but 6 plus million is a big number for me i dont feel like ive won the lottery because ive already earned that money but its good to know im going to get it
182699 its not the way i wanted this to go i wanted to be the red auerbach of the dallas mavericks after coaching but thats not what cuban wanted the good news is all this has forced me to continue coaching and im really enjoying working with mully warriors vice president of basketball operations chris mullin and being back with the warriors im having fun again and thats the way it should be its all working out great and ill probably end up doing something in a franchise patriarch role like i thought i was going to do in dallas
182700 how can we best support these great religious leaders of africa
182701 you may think that the killer would have known what he was doing
182702 he had planned it executed it with clinical efficiency and put into place an escape plan that included leaving behind no trace or clue to connect him with the crime
182703 make no mistake this killer managed to shoot a woman in broad daylight in the front garden of her home in a busy suburban street without making a sound and escape undetected that was no stroke of luck that was meticulous and careful planning
182704 it certainly defeated one of the biggest manhunts that this capital city has ever seen for over a year there were it seems no leads so who was this master criminal who outwitted scotland yard our barry what do you think

182707 the practical issues included world poverty the wars in iraq and afghanistan the situation in palestine and israel the danger of further wars and the freedom of religion
182708 denounce and deplore threats made against those who engage in interfaith dialogue
182709 so you can see that these terrorist groups are not that capable of instigating massive sabotage activities as some hostile forces hope to see
182710 to the beijing olympic games the biggest threat comes from the east turkistan terrorist organization
182711 these forces are trying all means to sabotage the beijing olympic games
182712 wolfgang clement hat in den vergangenen monaten gezeigt dass er mit der spd nicht mehr viel im sinn hat das ehrlichste w re dass er die konsequenzen zieht und sein parteibuch zur ckgibt
182713 dass clement in vielen sachfragen andere positionen vertritt als die partei ist nicht das problem es geht um den aufruf die spd nicht zu w hlen da muss sauber getrennt werden
182714 wenn es selbstverst ndlich werden sollte dass man dazu aufrufen kann die eigene partei nicht zu w hlen dann wird das selbstverst ndnis jeder politischen partei in frage gestellt
182715 never before in an election cycle has so much attention turned to the youth vote and luke will bring a unique perspective to covering it

182717 what the chinese tried to do was infiltrate their security to see who in china the tibet movement was talking to
182718 a lot of places in the world including china dont have the same view of personal space and privacy that we do in the united states
182719 youve got to suspect that every place youre doing work is being monitored and being watched
182720 were putting that technology in place to enable us to do that
182721 everybody has a camera in their telephones when people can record an event taking place that helps us during an investigation its helpful
182722 i think that while its appropriate for the police department to invite video reports of wrong doing both by ordinary people and police officers the new york police department has a long way to go to ensure that police officers who engage in wrongdoing like what was captured in the two video tapes that were recently disclosed are held accountable
182723 we believe that new media tools redefine who the online newsmakers and reporters are
182724 this is part of the foundation upon which nowpublic is built traditional influence lists are increasingly irrelevant because theyre predicated on outdated factors and metrics
182725 as the pressure increases on traditional media companies its a great opportunity for us
182726 we definitely have a very strong point of view of how to shore up your traditional business but also expand online weve shown success increasing page views and driving traffic
182727 a lot of them are doing the right things and were helping them along that path were helping them with the jump from old media to new media
182728 weve had a canadian media company come and talk to us and say we want to build our web revenue from 20 million to 100 million those are the sort of questions were getting
182729 brought a different level of access that we didnt have before
182730 this campaign has had extraordinary success in engaging children during the last year and the new ads along with the enhancements to the website will continue the momentum
182731 so far the only reason customers have noticed is because it became news
182732 while we are pleased that facetimes intellectual property rights are protected we are concerned about reuters timetable for installing replacement technology in light of its representations to the court as to its ability to provide adequate
182733 we have completed restoring mail service including historical messages to all of the 1 of affected members thank you all for your extreme patience during this trying time
182734 by completing this restoration of mail services we hope we have put the vast majority of mobileme problems behind us and can now focus on improving other aspects of this new ambitious service
182735 it seems that while i can log in to mobileme and view my calendar contacts i continue to not be able to see mail as mail comes up as a completely blank page
182736 its learning of it at almost the last minute that i think is destabilising the international media and certainly embarrassing for me as up till 48 hours ago i was insisting it would be free and uncensored internet access
182737 weve noticed that the words being used by bocog have changed in recent months from uncensored to what is more like convenient and timely or convenient and available these are quite different words
182738 nevertheless no one has come out publicly and said on behalf of bocog or the ioc sorry but there are certain internet websites which are blocked
182739 its having to find out and get the big surprise by an announcement by bocog at a press conference i think they could have done better
182740 this blatant media censorship adds one more broken promise that undermines the claim that the games would help improve human rights in china
182741 an evil fake religion that has been banned by the chinese government
182742 we went and nobody stopped us so we just shot
182743 lets wait for the wonderful performances when the games open on aug 8
182744 theyve managed to minimize handset share losses even in the face of fairly aggressive competition particularly from the koreans in north america
182745 theyve managed to hang on to more market share than we expected and managed to do it without cutting prices too much
182746 it still has a mountain to climb its product portfolio is still not competitive enough and sustaining its position in the north american market in the second half of 2008 may prove challenging
182747 a full service law firm uniquely positioned to provide strategic intellectual property corporate financing and litigation services
182748 located in the heart of silicon valleys technology and venture capital community
182749 microsoft has an open intellectual property licensing policy but in situations such as this in which a reasonable licensing agreement cannot be reached despite our best efforts we have no choice but to pursue legal action to protect our innovations
182750 primaxs practice of using our innovations without taking a patent license is unfair to the many companies that have already licensed our technology so we are taking action to protect both our partners and our innovations
182751 this is basically a way to run away from competition youre putting a lot of pressure on your less competitive peers
182752 nokia has always been extremely tactical with its pricing pinpointing sweet spots in different segments of the market and making adjustments to wrongfoot competitors
182753 the bd300 is another lg industry first and provides consumers with an advanced high def disc player with unparalleled flexibility and networked access for services such as netflix
182754 an unexpected activity that brought sudden risk to the organization and took one or more security personnel to address
182755 with 29 of respondents stating that they experienced the leakage of employee or customer data in 2007 it is alarming to see that only 11 of those types of incidents went reported
182756 security professionals need to remain cognizant of the regulations that their organizations must comply with and ensure they are taking steps to properly report the security incidents that are required by law whatever they may be
182757 the investment allows us to act on a global basis

182759 theyll fix it search is an iterative process but what the surge of interest in cuil showed is that theres a huge pent up demand for an alternative to google
182760 dr patterson joined google in 2004 and filed six patent applications
182761 now as an ex googler or xoogler she has focused on some of the weak points in the google approach to search namely privacy and comprehensive indexing
182762 were engineers and we are reading the press for good feedback and critical feedback
182763 if we didnt have improvements to make we wouldnt have a job here
182764 the trend is to access more and more applications in the cloud not call them locally
182765 thats forcing a lot of consumers who dont necessarily want to go with vista to reconsider their overall computing strategy
182766 they can switch to vista buy an apple machine or do something completely different
182767 people want ubiquitous cell service on their wireless phones everywhere they go and that includes their home and offices
182768 the airave makes it even easier to get enhanced coverage no matter where you live or work
182769 we have good visibility and a strong pipeline coming into the quarter
182770 theres an appetite for security and storage under one roof symantec is benefiting from that dynamic
182771 i think that provides a degree of insulation for us from broad macroeconomic slowdowns
182772 that said we are not immune perhaps a little better insulated than most
182773 we are not suggesting that it organizations stay away from blades blades do address many problems in the data center
182774 what we are saying is that it organizations adopting blades need to be prepared for further changes in this technology
182775 organizations must recognize that blade adoption needs to be a strategic vendor partnership decision and not a tactical purchase
182776 that venture investing is not the best use of a corporations capital and that it is inevitable that it will produce sub par returns at best and significant losses at worst
182777 theres a lot of emerging technology that can make a difference
182778 theres a lot of depth this year in areas such as cloud computing virtualization and mobility that didnt exist last year
182779 we want fios to succeed but were going to do what we have to do to protect our jobs and our healthcare
182780 we cant let corporate greed interfere with getting a fair contract
182781 the potential for very short term volatility around specific announcements in the process is predictable but we would be looking to buy verizon on dips rather than attempting to call each up and down tick over the month or so it may take to finally resolve the labor relationship for another period of years
182782 since the start of the year vendors have been wary of the potential decrease in demand for mobile phones
182783 that has not stopped vendors from experimenting with and releasing a host of mid range and high end devices with gps touchscreen and multimedia this also goes for hotly contested emerging markets where vendors are introducing phones that offer features in addition to voice telephony
182784 the companys relentless focus on and ability to meet demand within emerging markets helped propel shipment volumes forward
182785 there is no free phish an analysis of free and live phishing kits
182786 big companies like boeing are very serious about going forward with as much commonization and standardization solution sets across as many products and programs as soon as they can
182787 they need to bite the bullet now with significant migration issues rather than continue to go forward with all the disparate systems for every airplane out there
182788 i believe both gentlemen genuinely wish that we will be able to work together to enhance value
182789 while we still disagree on many points i have great hope this will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship
182790 in todays corporate governance system where large mutual funds control so much of the stock it is extremely difficult to oust an entire board no matter how strongly a large number of shareholders feel about the boards previous actions
182791 realizing i could not gain control i saw no point in spending the final two weeks in a debilitating fight when little would be accomplished except to build animosity between both camps
182792 intel has demonstrated that the performance of their systems can help facebook scale our infrastructure
182793 intel is excited to engage with facebook as they are a dynamic force in the evolution of the internet
182794 chinas semiconductor industry now is undergoing a transformation with an increased focus on designing chips for electronic products that are popular in the nation
182795 in the electronics industry china often is seen simply as a low cost manufacturing region
182796 however the rise of the semiconductor design business in china shows that the nations high tech future increasingly will reside in capitalizing on local brainpower to produce innovative products that appeal to the domestic audience
182797 we have not announced that we are going to be selling an mp3 player

182840 all courts should discourage litigation before trial that seems to seek to delay the commencement of trials
182841 allowing such pre trial litigation will often place prosecutors between a rock and a hard place
182842 they must on the one hand resist preliminary challenges to their investigations and to the institution of proceedings against accused persons on the other hand they are simultaneously obliged to ensure the prompt commencement of trials
182843 generally disallowing such litigation would ensure that the trial court decides the pertinent issues which it is best placed to do and would ensure that trials start sooner rather than later
182844 i conclude that the warrants in question were neither too vague nor too broad instead considered on their face value at the time of their issue they were reasonably intelligible to both the searcher and the searched
182845 finally zuma and thint have not pointed to any specific item that should not have been seized despite their knowing since 2006 which items were seized
182846 the project aims to do more than transfer basic wine knowledge
182847 our dream is that amongst this group there will also be some sufficiently inspired to advance their training still further and become sommeliers either by studying through the cape wine academy or by gaining experience or training abroad
182848 we invited the industry to submit wines for consideration in an open tender submissions were selected in a blind tasting by members of the cape winemakers guild according to the same exacting standards applied when choosing wines for its annual auction

182854 i dont think it will leave me for a while
182855 there tends to be a peak of incidents during this weekend
182856 i just always remember the natal day weekend wed hear about an incident or two or three so thats one of the reasons we want to remind people to be safe and particularly if youre going to be around water
182857 the majority of the population will comply with the law
182858 if youre only required to have it on board thats what people will do to comply we can educate people to actually wear the devices but like anything people sometimes do the minimum
182859 sometimes people go on outings on occasion and they dont feel like making the investment and actually purchasing them
182860 we want to reduce the barriers for people to have these things and more importantly that they wear them
182861 we have a lot of water theres a lot more opportunities

182868 the chief suspect in the 2001 anthrax postal attacks in the us has died from an apparent suicide just as the justice department was to file criminal charges against him bruce ivins 62 one of americas top biodefense researchers had been told that he was going to be prosecuted for the attacks that killed five people and sent the country into panic in the aftermath of the 9 11 attacks on the twin towers he died in hospital on thursday after taking a huge dose of prescription tylenol a painkiller mixed with codeine his imminent prosecution had not been made public but followed a government payout of us5 82m to a former government scientist steven hatfill who had been the fbis chief suspect for the anthrax attacks almost since the beginning the payout to hatfill an unusual development that exonerated him of being the anthrax attacker was an essential step to clear the way for prosecuting ivins lawyers familiar with the case told the la times the focus was moved to mr ivins after the head of the anthrax investigation was moved his replacement ordered agents to re examine leads or potential suspects and this led the fbi back to usamriid where agents had first questioned scientists including mr ivins in december 2001 a few weeks after the fatal mailings

182870 bad news has been pouring down on starbucks for a year the price of the companys stock has been cut in half and then some fewer people come through store doors and those who do buy less still when starbucks that longtime engine of growth announced that it planned to close 600 us stores 50 of them by the end of july and lay off 12 000 employees company watchers reacted with surprise the company thrived throughout the past 15 years by giving middle class americans exactly what they thought they wanted and this wasnt really about coffee it was about creating a product that allowed doctors and lawyers it specialists and travel writers and then their imitators to portray themselves as they wanted to be seen thats how products work in the world we live in we buy things to announce something about ourselves for the most part the products that sell the best are the ones that communicate most effectively thats what starbucks did with their coffee really then they sold not coffee but elevated status just by buying the coffee and speaking the companys made up lingua franca you became a cup carrying member of the upper class and that made starbucks overpriced as it was an affordable form of statusmaking that sense of success that sense of cool is what is gone now now that there are starbucks stores everywhere in tokyo and terre haute london and lancaster pa and calif and franklin tenn and franklin ind it is too ordinary
182871 why should the german be interested in the liberation of the jew if the jew is not interested in the liberation of the german we recognize in judaism therefore a general anti social element of the present time in the final analysis the emancipation of the jews is the emancipation of mankind from judaism indeed in north america the practical domination of judaism over the christian world has achieved as its unambiguous and normal expression that the preaching of the gospel itself and the christian ministry have become articles of trade money is the jealous god of israel in face of which no other god may exist

182884 while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
182885 all about the beat why hip hop cant save black america
182886 of course obama and his people have to condemn the rap because it does say some vulgar things
182887 if youre running for president youre supposed to be an upstanding individual
182888 theyre thinking an obama who knows how to play the game is still better for me than a mccain
182889 there are a ton of people who clearly are looking for obama to denounce this in order to continue to view him as credible
182890 he for political purposes has to separate himself from anything controversially black
182891 im not aware of hip hop music affecting any election so far and i dont think that this is going to be one either
182892 theres no doubt that hip hop culture moves our young people powerfully and some of it is not just a reflection of reality
182893 it also creates reality i think that if all our kids see is a glorification of materialism and bling and casual sex and kids are never seeing themselves reflected as hitting the books and being responsible and delaying gratification then they are getting an unrealistic picture of what the world is like
182894 lets get free strategies for organizing the hip hop voting bloc

182899 iran has also tested high altitude explosions of the shihab 3 a test mode consistent with emp attack and described the tests as successful iranian military writings explicitly discuss a nuclear emp attack that would gravely harm the united states
182900 while the commission does not know the intention of iran in conducting these activities we are disturbed by the capability that emerges when we connect the dots
182901 a determined adversary can achieve an emp attack capability without having a high level of sophistication
182902 for example an adversary would not have to have long range ballistic missiles to conduct an emp attack against the united states such an attack could be launched from a freighter off the u s coast using a short or medium range missile to loft a nuclear warhead to high altitude terrorists sponsored by a rogue state could attempt to execute such an attack without revealing the identity of the perpetrators
182903 potentially hostile states such as north korea and iran may also be developing the capability to pose an emp threat to the united states and may also be unpredictable and difficult to deter
182904 with a scud b they could cover the east coast and the west coast of the united states

182910 a nivel personal prefiero jugar el primero en casa y el segundo fuera pero los dem s dicen siempre que es mejor jugar el partido de vuelta en casa as que espero que esto ocurra tambi n en nuestro caso

182914 we had an illness outbreak that resulted in the premature euthanasia of about 56 animals
182915 the shelter design lends itself to outbreaks but even if we have a new state of the art shelter we could still face outbreaks but hopefully reduce the likelihood
182916 i have nothing against a new shelter if we get enough funds but the best thing you can do is to avoid putting the shelter in different areas

182932 the meeting leader said i am not telling you how to vote but if the democrats win this bill will pass and you wont have a vote on whether you want a union
182933 i am not a stupid person they were telling me how to vote
182934 if anyone representing wal mart gave the impression we were telling associates how to vote they were wrong and acting without approval
182935 we believe efca is a bad bill and we have been on record as opposing it for some time
182936 we feel educating our associates about the bill is the right thing to do
182937 i switch the trolley to the new track because its better to kill one person than to kill five
182938 i leave the trolley to kill the five because at least then i am not morally at fault
182939 is there a difference between killing a person and letting a person die
182940 i wont kill you but i dont have to save you
182941 i wont kill you but i dont have to save you
182942 batman is a masked superhero therefore a fascist and the movie must be fascist because its about a masked superhero
182943 set us on the course of returning to the 90s
182944 cms is committed to providing high quality care to those in skilled nursing facilities and to paying those facilities properly for that care
182945 however in view of the widespread industry concern that a recalibration could potentially have adverse effects on beneficiaries clinical staff and the quality of snf care we will continue to evaluate the underlying data carefully as we consider implementing an adjustment in the future
182946 ignited furor with a proposed definition of pregnancy that has the effect of classifying some of the most widely used methods of contraception as abortion
182947 any of the various procedures including the prescription and administration of any drug or the performance of any procedure or any other action that results in the termination of the life of a human being in utero between conception and natural birth whether before or after implantation
182948 its a redefinition of abortion that does not match any of the current medical definitions its ideologically based and not based on science and could interfere with the development of many new therapies to treat diseases
182949 another example of this administrations disregard for science and medicine in how agencies make decisions
182950 raises questions about a broad spectrum of scientific research and care
182951 is this going to result in a kind of blessed censorship of a whole host of areas of medical care and research
182952 you could imagine a group of people with less than honorable intentions seeking to get hired at a family planning clinic with a specific objective of obstructing access
182953 would essentially simply require people to comply with laws that they have been required to comply with for decades
182954 it is worth remembering that when it comes to real sustained growth in costs when it comes to real sustained erosion of families disposable income gas still cant hold a candle to the real elephant in the room health care
182955 that americans of many different political stripes are ready to stop tinkering and instead devise a fresh and national solution to our health care challenges
182956 are all wrong they work against value not for it
182957 one way to start would be to develop a national standard for what constitutes optimum quality health care in treating some of the more common and expensive diseases
182958 the second principle is to build a solution good enough for all americans
182959 the examples are under our noses build it as we did social security or medicare
182960 no one can design the perfect solution right out of the box
182961 the first stepping stone might be federal underwriting of the costs of some of the most expensive diseases
182962 in this election season we need to demand more attention to health care
182963 not the squeaky wheel now but after gas prices have been driven down or we have bought smaller cars our health care problem will still be with us
182964 today both parties stand together bound by the idea that we require a fundamental health care overhaul to ensure every american has access to quality affordable care
182965 what is troubling however is that many in washington see medicare as the blueprint for this reform
182966 clear to me that medicare is incapable of providing quality care for every american and must not be the model for national health care reform
182967 flawed structure increasingly fails our seniors on all counts responsiveness innovation access cost and quality
182968 many in washington proclaim all our health care problems would be resolved if only more americans were enrolled in medicare a tragic misdiagnosis
182969 patient centered improvements not broad expansion of a broken system
182970 controlled by the patient regardless of who is paying the bill
182971 this may be readily accomplished through the adoption of tax equity for the purchase of insurance active pooling mechanisms for increased purchasing power and focused reform of tax credits and deductions
182972 restoring proper incentives and the power of patient ownership and control is the best way to meet the obvious need for an improved health care system in america
182973 thats it four people got killed one of them was pauls wife pause the poor lug he hasnt been the same since pause the funny thing was she stopped in here just before it happened to stock up on cigars for him she was a nice lady ellen four or five months pregnant at the time which means that when she was killed the baby was killed too
182974 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
182975 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling by making sure your tires are properly inflated

182980 this integration will allow it organisations to automate deployment and provisioning and optimise service levels of server applications in a virtualised infrastructure helping them to reduce capital and operating costs while delivering order of magnitude improvement in time to market for critical business applications
182981 with this integration we can offer customers the ability to dynamically provision applications in a vmware environment the resulting integrated interoperability between different layers in the virtualisation stack is a prime example of what is required for next generation datacentre initiatives

183092 we have this hope as an anchor for the soul firm and secure
183093 the world already has its fair share of alcohol abuse
183094 ive been on paddling expeditions throughout canada to india tahiti peru ecuador and elsewhere but our journey down the la river was probably the most exotic and mind blowing of them all i tried three different craft in the la river whitewater kayak sit on top kayak and canoe and the simple canoe trumped them all
183095 we found that even at this driest time of year you can float a boat down the whole river we also saw that the river has all the requisite physical characteristics of a traditional navigable waterway suitable hydrology depth configuration and flow ample access points and paths evidence of public use etc and that the river has enormous potential for commercial activities birdwatching fishing painting etc this is especially true of the 7 mile stretch of class i rapids in the soft bottomed glendale narrows many people in riverside neighborhoods like atwater village expressed interest in boating tours via small watercraft
183096 unfortunately the rivers potential is limited by corps and county claims that the public doesnt have a right to its own river which runs contrary to california state law article 10 section 4 of its constitution its practically criminal to charge onerous fees to the public for something the public already has a fundamental right to access somebody should look into that
183097 the corps did waive film permit fees at the last minute but still says that boats mustnt touch water next year we hope we can include the corps and county as willing partners colonel magness in the river with a canoe now that would be a fantastic day for the entire la river community
183098 it was a real kick sure there were a few short portages around shopping carts and some rock ledges but there were also waterlines on the channel walls indicating that water is 6 12 inches higher during other times of the year obviously you wouldnt want to mess with this river when its raining or when there are thunderstorms in the foothills but by and large it was a pleasurable surreal urban odyssey full of human nature and other wildlife our permits were originally denied due to safety concerns but the biggest danger we encountered was slipping on algae exacerbated by all that hot concrete
183099 when we transitioned from concrete lined sections to natural ones at the beginning of the sepulveda basin the glendale narrows and the estuary at willow street in long beach there were brief stretches where plants and soil were working overtime to uptake the pollutants and everything would smell unbelievably rank but after 20 yards it would start to balance out nature would prevail and you could start to imagine yourself anywhere but here in l a its really a pretty extraordinary fun experience
183100 summer 1983 hinamizawa is a tranquil village but its inhabitants have been plagued by strange deaths and unexplained disappearances seemingly every year some say its the terrifying curse of hinamizawas legendary deity oyashiro sama causing victims to be spirited away by monsters but is this town harboring dark horrying secrets even more sinister than any supersition or myth
183101 of his own volition he suggested adding an hour to the questioning the questions were to the point
183102 we do not view modern as a trend with a set style one moment angular the next soft and rounded it is more a state of mind which exploits the unique and elegant character imparted by a flowing and purposeful sheer line and receives and translates it into the various other lines and shapes which create the deckhouses and the total yacht
183103 for two years weve narrowly lost to kent so to win by a clear 20 points and without losing a match this season is fantastic the trophy is back where it belongs it was a shame the rain intervened today but it doesnt feel any less special
183104 this is my first year as captain and it couldnt have gone any better the future of sussex cricket looks really bright with plenty of young players pushing for places theres no reason why we cant stay at the top for many years to come
183105 first of all its a massive achievement for us to compete with and defeat the famous state schools in the area and to go on and represent sussex at national level
183106 it shows that state schools are capable of producing first rate cricketers and competitive teams and long may it continue
183107 obviously there are a few obstacles at state school level we dont tend to have the pupils with a background and experience in cricket so it can be quite difficult in the state schools alone
183108 however the young school sports coordinators are doing really well these are people who are working with five or six local primary schools to bring up the standard of school sports and ensuring that facilities are available from an early age the chance to shine initiative has also made an important contribution
183109 we do have a few things going for us harlands primary school is nearby and has produced some excellent cricketers they have won the asda kwik cricket tournament some of their players move on to warden park so the talent is there to develop
183110 there are also three or four good cricket clubs within a few miles of the school so theres a lot of youth cricket going on and plenty of chances for our pupils to practice elsewhere
183111 with sussex playing well and picking up trophies its given the whole county a lift and has raised the profile of the game locally
183112 the club is also doing some great work with younger players helping clubs and running academy sessions it means that players are getting a chance to play at a higher level than was previously possible
183113 since the ashes a lot more children want to actively take up the game in a big way not just playing a bit at school some of our kids play two or three school matches a week and play for clubs as well
183114 the series really raised enthusiasm for the game throughout the country and nowadays there are some really high levels of dedication
183115 were incredibly grateful to the parents they make a major contribution they have to want to support their kids to help them get to a higher level they drive the children to matches pay for their coaching a lot of the parents weve encountered are really keen to help their kids progress which is invaluable
183116 last year we had james thorpe who is already playing sussex second xi cricket and is involved with the england u17 set up he is a fantastic player and role model
183117 out of our current crop of year 7s five boys have been selected for the sussex elite squad we get a few boys each year representing the county some of whom look to have some real potential

183196 most of the players id say about 99 9 per cent want to go to the olympics this is a big big big deal
183197 guys want to go but theyre just being held back by their clubs theyre important for their clubs and you can understand it but i think its a great rule that they have to be released
183198 the olympics is an opportunity to be on the world stage its a huge event and everyone wants to be a part of it
183199 i can understand why the clubs want to do everything to keep their players but for the players i just think its a great tournament to be a part of
183200 i know a lot of younger players had problems with their clubs about going to the olympics but my club ajax didnt make any problems
183201 i didnt have any problems they understood that it was very important for me to play in this tournament
183202 the security concerns are many and when we have 65 suicide attacks last year so the foreign players are obviously scared of coming to pakistan
183203 i really dont know what to say but the way things are the way foreign teams are constantly talking about the security it seems difficult that the tournament would be held in pakistan
183204 if the government gets involved it might help the pcbs cause
183205 it is all a ploy to reduce the blow for pakistan when they finally shift the event away from here to sri lanka if india takes a strong stand then the icc and the countries not wanting to send their teams to pakistan might come under pressure
183206 the trade deficit numbers were definitely a comfort after last months shocker but it still looks like a rangy play for now

183239 it is equally true that the majority of irish voters are not alone in rejecting a more federal future for europe in lisbons earlier guise as the eu constitution it was rejected by the french and the dutch polls showed that voters in up to 16 eu member states would have rejected lisbon had they been given the chance to vote
183240 first it is clear that irelands no was not a no to europe any more than the french and dutch rejections were it was a pro european no there is no evidence that this vote represented a rejection of the eu or its ideals a continent united in peace and co operation

183245 on that point it is worth noting that the current treaties require unanimous agreement for any new arrangement on the number of eu commissioners so talk of ireland automatically losing a commissioner unless lisbon goes through is wildly misplaced
183246 the eu is a union of democratic sovereign nation states and if the electorate of one eu country rejects a treaty then that should be that
183247 moreover the rejection of lisbon does not actually present any real problem for the eu contrary to all the froth about an enlarged europes desperate need for the eu constitution lisbon treaty to work efficiently the quiet truth is that the eu is in fact working perfectly well under the current treaties

183269 microsoft failed to meet its windows mobile sales target for its fiscal year 2008 the company said on thursday
183270 by june 30 when the fiscal year ended microsoft had managed to sell more than 18 million licenses less than its 20 million goal
183271 while the iphone 3g didnt hit stores until july 11 after microsofts fiscal year ended it could have had an effect on microsoft the iphone 3g is causing people to hesitate said bill hughes an analyst at in stat that doesnt mean those 2 million all went to the iphone but some people likely decided to wait and see if the newest version of apples phone could be more attractive to them than a windows mobile phone he said
183272 abi research analyst kevin burden suspects that the shortcoming in sales was due to a failure to make more headway among consumer users while microsoft has typically targeted windows mobile at enterprise users it has recently begun talking more about the consumer oriented features to the software microsoft may have inflated its potential windows mobile sales for the year based on hopes that it would gain customers attracted to the consumer oriented message he said
183273 though microsoft wouldnt single out any cellphone manufacturers by name analysts speculated that delays of sony ericssons xperia could have impacted the sales target
183274 the iphone was also a factor with some speculating that the july launch of the new 3g device may have caused some to hesitate buying a windows mobile phone
183275 of course the other reason could be that windows mobile which for years was targeted to business users just didnt have enough consumer appeal
183276 robbie bach president of the entertainment amp devices division touted the 20 million unit projection repeatedly during presentations at industry trade shows during the past year
183277 the first clue about the shortfall emerged in early june when a letter from lees to the companys partners said the company would sell
183278 of course the other reason could be that windows mobile which for years was targeted to business users just didnt have enough consumer appeal
183279 its time for apple to get serious about apple tv
183280 if steve jobs wants to make a serious run at owning our living rooms digital hub then apple tv needs a serious overhaul asap
183281 add a safari browser with all the plugins youd need to watch videos from hulu mlbtv nbc abc fox etc listen to audio from muxtape last fm pandora and other sites that arent too directly competing
183282 in theory this also means that apple is eventually inviting itunes competitors like netflix or amazon onto its box since they offer browser based video services of their own but better to have to compete for space on your own platform than have a platform no one uses
183283 an apple tv with an optional blu ray drive could replace the dvd player in every living room an apple tv without one is a compromise there just arent enough movies on itunes to make digital delivery a feasible primary option today
183284 thats it for now at least lets not get ahead of ourselves appletv doesnt need too many features it just needs to make our tv watching experience better by adding as many video sources as possible in one nicely designed package

183287 the trade associations simply requested time to consult with their constituencies on the revised draft sector code the trade associations also expressed concern at the slow progress in the resolution of the ownership matter but certainly did not walk out of the meeting

183564 while shipping lines and importers increasingly favour the use of modern high cube containers many of the s key freight rail routes are not able to handle them greatly reducing the use of rail as a viable alternative to road transport
183565 we want to maxim pdps terminal at teesport currently handles around 13 trains per day
183566 while high cube containers can be transported on special wagons the higher capital costs of special wagons and the reduced payload can increase operating costs which many businesses are unwilling to accept to maintain rail freights cost effectiveness the uk government must upgrade the rail infrastructure on strategic freight routes to and from our from deep sea destinations will be the 96
183567 congestion on the roads currently costs brit economic efficiency for manufacturers and retailers
183568 use of freight trains reduces the environmental impact of the supply chain in the britains increasing demand for imported container
183569 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
183570 the mccain campaign was compelled to respond to this outrageous attack because we will not allow john mccain to be smeared by senator obama as a racist for offering legitimate criticism

183576 we havent had an announcement like this at this airport for several several years
183577 im very happy to announce that weve gotten an ice sample
183578 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
183579 we got a little bit of ice mixed in with this sample
183580 there are two groups and they start out like this ok
183581 because this is a polymer its plastic right in theory you could make these flexible so you could imagine some sort of flexible computer monitor
183582 the technology just isnt there yet but thats where its headed
183583 were not going to be making cell phones here in my lab
183584 my group will never be widget producers but were going to learn more and more things about what these polymers can be made to do what we do may some day help the widget makers
183585 conjugated polymers will fluoresce if you put electricity through them but weve focused on light because its very straightforward and an easy thing to do
183586 if you made them coil up they would glow a different color than when theyre all spread out
183587 so i thought wouldnt it be cool if we could force them to do that with a light signal just say do it now and now go backwards
183588 once you can talk to the azobenzenes and figure out how to make them brighter and dimmer you ask ok
183589 anytime anyone reviews one of my papers theyll say well this is all really great and everything but how does it work in the film
183590 we did not know if there would be enough room in the film for the molecules to coil and uncoil
183591 we want to take the effects we have and try to make them stronger by swapping out the azobenzenes with other kind of photoactive molecules
183592 that may help us achieve the total intensity on intensity off effect that were looking for
183593 it also may help us do some fancier and more dramatic color change applications
183594 people who are going to china should take a clean computer one with no data at all
183595 what the chinese tried to do was infiltrate their security to see who in china the tibet movement was talking to
183596 a lot of places in the world including china dont have the same view of personal space and privacy that we do in the united states
183597 youve got to suspect that every place youre doing work is being monitored and being watched
183598 whether its a file or an e mail if youre worried about it you should probably encrypt it
183599 the stated goal is to reach 1 billion in revenue in the next three years from the mid 600 million this year
183600 countless industries have reached an energy ceiling over the past half century only to realize soon after that revenue potential had peaked
183601 the cold hard truth is that an ample supply of energy is necessary to grow any business over the long term and the storage industry is shying away from the harsh reality that a sufficient amount of energy is unfortunately not available to keep the industry growing
183602 the return on investment roi for the r amp d that will be necessary to expand the storage benefit per consumed watt will almost certainly shrink over time resulting in lower and lower profit margins flat to shrinking revenue and declining roi are the ingredients of a decaying industry
183603 in order to satisfy the demand the uptime institute suggests that multiple thousand megawatt power plants will be needed once the server virtualization benefit phase ends
183604 green computing is almost the equivalent of battling a raging inferno through the design of smaller matches if only the storage industry consortia realized that by hailing their energy efficiency activities they merely appear content with a reputation of environmental responsibility as they proclaim their industrys doomed state in fact without more power plants the typical storage industry consortium had best realize that its membership numbers will soon be on the decline as the automotive industrys experience proves the number of suppliers to the storage industry will soon fall off of a cliff

183610 my son was just starting out on what would have been a good career and becoming someone who was a useful member of society
183611 he was not looking for trouble and he was not mixed up with any crime
183612 it seems fair to hypothesize that ap as structured today wont be in the position to pick up the slack as newspaper staffs are thinned
183613 many of the kinds of stories covered by individual newspapers today simply wont see the light of day in the future
183614 an unexpected activity that brought sudden risk to the organization and took one or more security personnel to address
183615 with 29 of respondents stating that they experienced the leakage of employee or customer data in 2007 it is alarming to see that only 11 of those types of incidents went reported
183616 security professionals need to remain cognizant of the regulations that their organizations must comply with and ensure they are taking steps to properly report the security incidents that are required by law whatever they may be
183617 we are not suggesting that it organizations stay away from blades blades do address many problems in the data center
183618 what we are saying is that it organizations adopting blades need to be prepared for further changes in this technology
183619 organizations must recognize that blade adoption needs to be a strategic vendor partnership decision and not a tactical purchase
183620 were putting that technology in place to enable us to do that
183621 everybody has a camera in their telephones when people can record an event taking place that helps us during an investigation its helpful
183622 i think that while its appropriate for the police department to invite video reports of wrong doing both by ordinary people and police officers the new york police department has a long way to go to ensure that police officers who engage in wrongdoing like what was captured in the two video tapes that were recently disclosed are held accountable
183623 that venture investing is not the best use of a corporations capital and that it is inevitable that it will produce sub par returns at best and significant losses at worst
183624 countless industries have reached an energy ceiling over the past half century only to realize soon after that revenue potential had peaked
183625 the cold hard truth is that an ample supply of energy is necessary to grow any business over the long term and the storage industry is shying away from the harsh reality that a sufficient amount of energy is unfortunately not available to keep the industry growing

183631 the airave makes it even easier to get enhanced coverage no matter where you live or work
183632 what the chinese tried to do was infiltrate their security to see who in china the tibet movement was talking to
183633 a lot of places in the world including china dont have the same view of personal space and privacy that we do in the united states
183634 youve got to suspect that every place youre doing work is being monitored and being watched
183635 the trend is to access more and more applications in the cloud not call them locally
183636 thats forcing a lot of consumers who dont necessarily want to go with vista to reconsider their overall computing strategy
183637 they can switch to vista buy an apple machine or do something completely different
183638 this is basically a way to run away from competition youre putting a lot of pressure on your less competitive peers
183639 nokia has always been extremely tactical with its pricing pinpointing sweet spots in different segments of the market and making adjustments to wrongfoot competitors
183640 i believe both gentlemen genuinely wish that we will be able to work together to enhance value
183641 while we still disagree on many points i have great hope this will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship
183642 in todays corporate governance system where large mutual funds control so much of the stock it is extremely difficult to oust an entire board no matter how strongly a large number of shareholders feel about the boards previous actions
183643 realizing i could not gain control i saw no point in spending the final two weeks in a debilitating fight when little would be accomplished except to build animosity between both camps
183644 intel has demonstrated that the performance of their systems can help facebook scale our infrastructure
183645 intel is excited to engage with facebook as they are a dynamic force in the evolution of the internet
183646 we want fios to succeed but were going to do what we have to do to protect our jobs and our healthcare
183647 we cant let corporate greed interfere with getting a fair contract
183648 the potential for very short term volatility around specific announcements in the process is predictable but we would be looking to buy verizon on dips rather than attempting to call each up and down tick over the month or so it may take to finally resolve the labor relationship for another period of years
183649 we have completed restoring mail service including historical messages to all of the 1 of affected members thank you all for your extreme patience during this trying time
183650 by completing this restoration of mail services we hope we have put the vast majority of mobileme problems behind us and can now focus on improving other aspects of this new ambitious service
183651 it seems that while i can log in to mobileme and view my calendar contacts i continue to not be able to see mail as mail comes up as a completely blank page
183652 theres a lot of emerging technology that can make a difference
183653 theres a lot of depth this year in areas such as cloud computing virtualization and mobility that didnt exist last year
183654 so far the only reason customers have noticed is because it became news
183655 while we are pleased that facetimes intellectual property rights are protected we are concerned about reuters timetable for installing replacement technology in light of its representations to the court as to its ability to provide adequate
183656 since the start of the year vendors have been wary of the potential decrease in demand for mobile phones
183657 that has not stopped vendors from experimenting with and releasing a host of mid range and high end devices with gps touchscreen and multimedia this also goes for hotly contested emerging markets where vendors are introducing phones that offer features in addition to voice telephony
183658 the companys relentless focus on and ability to meet demand within emerging markets helped propel shipment volumes forward
183659 this campaign has had extraordinary success in engaging children during the last year and the new ads along with the enhancements to the website will continue the momentum
183660 theyll fix it search is an iterative process but what the surge of interest in cuil showed is that theres a huge pent up demand for an alternative to google
183661 dr patterson joined google in 2004 and filed six patent applications
183662 now as an ex googler or xoogler she has focused on some of the weak points in the google approach to search namely privacy and comprehensive indexing

183665 the bd300 is another lg industry first and provides consumers with an advanced high def disc player with unparalleled flexibility and networked access for services such as netflix
183666 microsoft has an open intellectual property licensing policy but in situations such as this in which a reasonable licensing agreement cannot be reached despite our best efforts we have no choice but to pursue legal action to protect our innovations
183667 primaxs practice of using our innovations without taking a patent license is unfair to the many companies that have already licensed our technology so we are taking action to protect both our partners and our innovations
183668 we believe that new media tools redefine who the online newsmakers and reporters are
183669 this is part of the foundation upon which nowpublic is built traditional influence lists are increasingly irrelevant because theyre predicated on outdated factors and metrics
183670 people really thought the non farm payrolls number was going to be a bad number
183671 so not only was the latest number 20 25 000 better than expected but the prior two months were revised up
183672 buffalo mayor byron brown and his staff bent over backwards for us as did the people at buffalo urban development corp
183673 they are absolutely out of room where they are and they needed to hire these people immediately so the jobs had to go to tampa

183695 its very dramatic and awe inspiring when the darkness suddenly comes thats why thousands of tourists go to see
183696 it could have come from the suits or trousers in miss dandos wardrobe or from her fiance alan farthings wardrobe

183709 notwithstanding the strength of our local market stations and local digital media operations our second quarter financial results reflect the reality of a very weak advertising economy
183710 we continue to be very pleased with the competitive performance of many of our stations and with the excellence of our local news effort
183711 it became cold and dark and suddenly it was light again i am very happy it was worth the trip
183712 these days we dont think its bad or lucky its just natural
183713 eclipses were reported where none took place in areas of political or bureaucratic strife
183714 wed already known about this eclipse many years before we got the right to host the olympics so how can we explain this is retribution
183715 there is no guarantee that these talks would lead to an offer for the company
183716 we think that conditions notably financial to develop in the u k are not met
183717 ambition is to be a major actor in the nuclear renaissance
183718 all sides still have a knife under their throat here
183719 we thought it was a good deal and we were ready to accept
183720 commitment to nuclear power is clear and nuclear new build does not depend on one single deal
183721 in that respect the negative cash flow in the second quarter is overstated
183722 were going to get the second quarter behind us and just move ahead
183723 as our recent product capacity and liquidity actions clearly demonstrate we are reacting rapidly to the challenges facing the u s economy and auto market and we continue to take the aggressive steps necessary to transform our u s operations

183726 never before in an election cycle has so much attention turned to the youth vote and luke will bring a unique perspective to covering it
183727 im not trying to be my father hes irreplaceable im simply trying to do something that i think theres a real niche for that theres a calling for that has to do with youth not just in the election but in politics from now on

183732 weve got a pretty noisy competitor out there you know it i know it its caused some impact were going to start countering it they tell us its the iway or the highway we think thats a sad message software out there is made to be compatible with your whole life
183733 its learning of it at almost the last minute that i think is destabilising the international media and certainly embarrassing for me as up till 48 hours ago i was insisting it would be free and uncensored internet access
183734 weve noticed that the words being used by bocog have changed in recent months from uncensored to what is more like convenient and timely or convenient and available these are quite different words
183735 nevertheless no one has come out publicly and said on behalf of bocog or the ioc sorry but there are certain internet websites which are blocked
183736 its having to find out and get the big surprise by an announcement by bocog at a press conference i think they could have done better
183737 this blatant media censorship adds one more broken promise that undermines the claim that the games would help improve human rights in china
183738 an evil fake religion that has been banned by the chinese government
183739 we went and nobody stopped us so we just shot
183740 lets wait for the wonderful performances when the games open on aug 8
183741 big companies like boeing are very serious about going forward with as much commonization and standardization solution sets across as many products and programs as soon as they can
183742 they need to bite the bullet now with significant migration issues rather than continue to go forward with all the disparate systems for every airplane out there
183743 we have not announced that we are going to be selling an mp3 player
183744 we are looking into the possibility of coming up with different content avenues that can be shared across multiple devices built by dell
183745 that is something unique thats not fully offered in the marketplace right now
183746 as the pressure increases on traditional media companies its a great opportunity for us
183747 we definitely have a very strong point of view of how to shore up your traditional business but also expand online weve shown success increasing page views and driving traffic
183748 a lot of them are doing the right things and were helping them along that path were helping them with the jump from old media to new media
183749 weve had a canadian media company come and talk to us and say we want to build our web revenue from 20 million to 100 million those are the sort of questions were getting

183751 there is no free phish an analysis of free and live phishing kits
183752 chinas semiconductor industry now is undergoing a transformation with an increased focus on designing chips for electronic products that are popular in the nation
183753 in the electronics industry china often is seen simply as a low cost manufacturing region
183754 however the rise of the semiconductor design business in china shows that the nations high tech future increasingly will reside in capitalizing on local brainpower to produce innovative products that appeal to the domestic audience
183755 the investment allows us to act on a global basis
183756 in china and india its a lot related to services and software
183757 theyve managed to minimize handset share losses even in the face of fairly aggressive competition particularly from the koreans in north america
183758 theyve managed to hang on to more market share than we expected and managed to do it without cutting prices too much
183759 it still has a mountain to climb its product portfolio is still not competitive enough and sustaining its position in the north american market in the second half of 2008 may prove challenging
183760 we have good visibility and a strong pipeline coming into the quarter
183761 theres an appetite for security and storage under one roof symantec is benefiting from that dynamic
183762 i think that provides a degree of insulation for us from broad macroeconomic slowdowns
183763 that said we are not immune perhaps a little better insulated than most

183767 i was talking to one of his ex girlfriends not too long ago and she was texting him the whole way back from edmonton until 10 minutes before this accident happens
183768 he was just sitting there texting her listening to music on his cellphone
183769 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed
183770 we heard this blood curdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
183771 there was no rage or anything he was like a robot stabbing the guy
183772 we put our bodies up against the door waiting for him to come out and he went back and brought the head to the front and pretty much displayed it and dropped it on the ground in front of us
183773 all very calmly he was wearing sunglasses it was no big deal to him
183774 the guy came to the front of the door with buddys head in his hands decapitated he dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body back up
183775 tim you were the best guy ever you didnt deserve this at all
183776 my brother was supposed to go meet him at the bus depot and he never showed up
183777 i was completely shocked cuz tim has never been a roughhousing guy
183778 hes always been a quiet guy just kind of socialized with his buddies and that was it
183779 from what i hear this other guy is three times his size
183780 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
183781 we want to make sure the process is followed as aggressively as possible the full legal process
183782 this particular incident as horrific as it is is obviously extremely rare certainly the horrific nature of it is probably one of a kind in canadian history
183783 due to the rural nature of our network airport type security is not practical its a very different type of system
183784 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
183785 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting
183786 he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal about a half an hour later we heard this blood curdling scream

183790 while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
183791 all about the beat why hip hop cant save black america
183792 of course obama and his people have to condemn the rap because it does say some vulgar things
183793 if youre running for president youre supposed to be an upstanding individual
183794 theyre thinking an obama who knows how to play the game is still better for me than a mccain
183795 there are a ton of people who clearly are looking for obama to denounce this in order to continue to view him as credible johnson said
183796 he for political purposes has to separate himself from anything controversially black
183797 im not aware of hip hop music affecting any election so far and i dont think that this is going to be one either
183798 theres no doubt that hip hop culture moves our young people powerfully and some of it is not just a reflection of reality
183799 lets get free strategies for organizing the hip hop voting bloc
183800 before a lot of the songs about barack were supporting his campaign
183801 this song is different in that it almost claims the victory thats scary for some people who dont want to see that happen
183802 if i could get a message to him i would say that i didnt mean to cause such a stir i just wanted to get the passport back to him so he could go on tour in america i contacted virgin radio because i know christian is friends with roger from some charity work they did together and hes not the easiest person to contact
183803 this is a cultural catastrophe a national tragedy there is so little of art of such level in the former soviet union

183807 i realized during making fable 2 what atrocious mistakes ive made in the past i dont think i was skilful enough to make fable 1 better but i learned so much from the mistakes in fable 1 and that is what im proudest about in fable 2
183808 weve got plans for fable 3 4 and 5 its a big story arc and you can see that if you play fable 2 youll recognize things from fable 1
183809 there is another project at lionhead that weve been working on for quite some time its kinda the result of an experiment that went incredibly well and we thought this has got to go be a game i cant say anything about it at all

183813 gas is so expensive now that even this small drop in price is enough to make it worth filling up
183814 the prices in henrietta are worth waiting for no matter how long
183815 i can use the money i save at the pump towards bills and groceries
183816 i try to combine all my shopping doctors appointments and errands into one trip to save time and money
183817 if i can do everything in henrietta i can fill up at these prices and save even more money
183818 at these prices it really doesnt matter where you go but i want to know why i have to pay 40 cents more a gallon where i live
183819 even at 3 89 a gallon im sure the oil companies are still making a huge profit someone needs to take responsibility for this
183820 whatever the new york times suggests we do we will do the opposite
183821 theres going to be a little bit of pushing and shoving
183822 it gets pretty wild in the last 10 or 15 laps we saw a lot of action last year and i dont expect it to be any different this year
183823 netwerkbeheerders trekken het niet als elke drie maanden elke dns server gepatcht moet worden daarom is besloten eerst heel goed na te denken over vervolgstappen
183824 hoewel het op zou moeten vallen wanneer een crimineel probeert de juiste afzenderpoort te raden zijn er genoeg providers aan het slaapwandelen het is dus mogelijk dat een crimineel een gepatchte dns server bij een provider overneemt zonder dat die provider daar iets van merkt
183825 dnssec is echt een gewapend beton oplossing maar vereist dat netwerkbeheerders regelmatig nieuwe sleutels cre ren die eis is weinig realistisch netwerkbeheerders zijn het zicht op hun dns infrastructuur vaak kwijt ze zijn gewend dat dns gewoon werkt los daarvan je zou de hele internetgemeenschap moeten overtuigen van het gebruik van een nieuw protocol maar het is net als bij breedbeeld televisie dat heeft alleen zin wanneer iedereen overstapt
183826 i feel i have something to prove and thats why im here
183827 ive been really impressed with what ive seen here and the club have been impressed by me its a natural move
183828 ill be giving everything for the club im here to win games and win points and to help us stay up
183829 its going to be tough but i think the club is gearing up to stay in the premier league
183830 i know one top club in the premier league wanted to sign thomas but their goalkeeping coach moved and we managed to sneak in and get the deal done
183831 hes trained exceptionally well and looks as fit as a fiddle
183832 weve now let thomas go back to denmark because his family is there and the deal was done very quickly
183833 excuse me would you mind stepping round the other side so that my partner doesnt continue to pull her neck muscles

183835 the social and economic situations now require us to carry out politics rather than discussing the lower house dissolution
183836 in july job losses continued in several industries including construction manufacturing and employment services
183837 mr holbrooke undertook on behalf of the usa that i would not be tried before this tribunal
183838 not only from public but also from party offices and completely disappear from the public arena not give interviews and not even publish literary works in a word become invisible long enough for the dayton agreement to be implemented in full
183839 that i get out of the way and go to russia greece or serbia and open a private clinic just as long as i left pale
183840 it is clear that unable to fulfil the commitments he had undertaken on behalf of the usa he holbrooke switched to plan b the liquidation of radovan karadzic
183841 the agreement which should have brought me peace and freedom thus became a source of great danger to my life and to the life and safety of my family and even my friends
183842 holbrookes wish for my disappearance is today still fresher and stronger and the actions aimed at bringing this about are tireless
183843 while these activities continue and with this threat to my life i have to sit in a place which is known to him and his friends and prepare my defence
183844 i was in danger of being liquidated because i had made a commitment
183845 i cannot imagine that his defence would be anything but a political one
183846 the family has always said they have evidence of proof of the secret agreement
183847 we are hearing voices i believe those inside the rubble will be saved
183848 we are hearing voices i believe those inside the rubble will be saved
183849 it speaks for itself that we did not carry out this reshuffle with a view to raising the public support ratings in preparation for the dissolution
183850 our cabinet aims to figure out ways to realize policy issues that face us and to tackle issues
183851 we are not carrying out politics or doing work as cabinet members for the sake of ratings
183852 it has been 10 months since i took office and during this time i have been working based on the idea of promoting a government administration that places emphasis on peoples lives and stands at the level of the general public
183853 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
183854 we are not going to let anybody paint john mccain who has fought his entire life for equal rights for everyone to be able to be painted as racist
183855 weve seen this happen before and were not going to let it happen to us
183856 what barack obama was saying is hes not exactly from central casting for presidential candidates
183857 were not going negative in return were refuting the charges
183858 its a great ad and everybodys talking about it and were having a great time with it
183859 we didnt draw first blood i mean this campaign has been rough and tumble since the day barack obama got his nomination and weve withered under the attacks of the obama campaign on a daily basis
183860 more than 37 000 service members have been killed or wounded and patriot golf day is a way for patriotic americans to assist families of those military personnel who have given the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom
183861 taylormade adidas golfs support of patriot golf day has helped us add a critical fundraising component that will allow us to reach more families with scholarships and other forms of support
183862 when we learned of dan rooneys fundraising mission with patriot golf day it wasnt a question of whether or not we would but how much could we do to help
183863 we hope the money raised from the auction of the taylormade limited edition drivers will positively impact families of servicemen and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice to protect our freedom

183877 fundamental to holistic medicine is the recognition that each state of health and disease requires a consideration of all contributing factors psychological psychosocial environmental and spiritual
183878 all states of health and all disorders are considered to by psychosomatic pelletier 1977
183879 the entire body and psyche can be treated or diagnosed through the treatment or observations of a special part of the anatomy
183880 holistic medicine has not really been investigated that funds ought to be made available for conducting tests of holistic practices and that meanwhile we should keep our minds open about holistic techniques
183881 the lack of evidence concerning the specific curative powers of holistic therapies is the result of a conspiracy of disinterest

183907 during this meeting jol threatened a representative of the tactical staff several times and this was repeated by phone later that day
183908 no employer accepts that kind of threats and neither does the knvb
183909 holland are a really nice team to watch and they have many great players these are the guys you pay to go and watch it will be great just to be on the same pitch as them
183910 however although they have many good players we need to show we can compete with them and learn so we can go to the olympics with confidence
183911 these kind of comments and innuendos have no place in a presidential campaign of this importance
183912 what hes offering voters is increasingly harsh character attacks i think voters did expect different from john mccain
183913 susan eisenhower president of the eisenhower group and ikes granddaughter added
183914 mccain or senator clinton is trying to scare you about me because i dont look like the other presidents i look different
183915 the road hes on right now hes going to quickly erode that political capital which is very hard capital to build up
183916 a democratic committee devoted to writing the platform is to meet today in cleveland to hear presentations from policy advocates then draft the document there were so many examples in the media of sexist comments where we never heard from the party leadership or barack obama said stacy mason executive director of a political action committee called womencount which claims thousands of members the group ran newspaper ads in the spring urging clinton to stay in the contest
183917 were focused on why the democratic leadership was so silent about it during the campaign mason said
183918 during a conference call the national republican congressional committee chairman instructed candidates campaign managers and press secretaries that given the anti incumbent environment it could be beneficial for house gop candidates to distance themselves from politicians they may be serving with next year
183919 the nrcc chief discouraged candidates from attending the national convention in minneapolis st paul saying that spending days there would be a waste of time and they would be better off campaigning
183920 how did this years senate playing field become one of the most lopsided in recent memory a quartet of important factors political climate math money and retirements are all working against the gop this time by any number of measures the national political climate is extremely hostile to the republican party
183921 basic math is also working against senate republicans because they must defend 23 seats compared with the democrats 12 two of the gop held seats will be on the line in special elections in november because of the resignation last december of mississippis trent lott and the death in june 2007 of wyomings craig thomas heading toward election day democrats enjoy a target rich environment while republicans have many fewer opportunities to offset losses by flipping democratic held seats into their column
183922 the third factor money is traditionally a plus for republicans or at least a wash this time though democrats have an overwhelming advantage as of june 30 the dscc had raised 93 3 million for the cycle and had 46 2 million in the bank the national republican senatorial committee had taken in 58 8 million and had 24 6 million cash on hand the gap is huge even though the nrscs fundraising has improved in recent months
183923 a final factor this year is retirements one of the basic tenets of campaign politics is that its always easier to snatch an open seat away from the other party than it is to defeat an incumbent five republican senators are retiring wayne allard of colorado larry craig of idaho pete domenici of new mexico chuck hagel of nebraska and john warner of virginia not a single democratic senator plans to retire this year
183924 john mccain has found at least one issue where he enjoys something of an advantage over barack obama offshore drilling for oil
183925 with gas prices way up this summer polls in battleground states including michigan have consistently found strong support for offshore drilling
183926 but even as the two presumptive presidential nominees continue to squabble about the past their debate over the future of u s troops in iraq seems to have entered a broad new middle ground in which the question is not whether to withdraw but rather the speed and circumstances of departure in recent days mccain has said he could support withdrawal over 16 months the timetable proposed by obama provided conditions were right obama has said that he would adapt his withdrawal timeline should things drastically worsen as were drawing down both advocate leaving a residual u s force in iraq although neither has specified the size of such a force or where it would be based
183927 wal mart stores inc is mobilizing its store managers and department supervisors around the country to warn that if democrats win power in november theyll likely change federal law to make it easier for workers to unionize companies including wal mart
183928 in recent weeks thousands of wal mart store managers and department heads have been summoned to mandatory meetings at which the retailer stresses the downside for workers if stores were to be unionized according to about a dozen wal mart employees who attended such meetings in seven states wal mart executives claim that employees at unionized stores would have to pay hefty union dues while getting nothing in return and may have to go on strike without compensation also unionization could mean fewer jobs as labor costs rise
183929 will be introduced by jeff blake a st petersburg resident who will talk about his own experiences tackling the challenges that face so many americans under the bush economy rising gas prices and stagnant wages sen obama will discuss his plans to provide real relief to families struggling in these tough economic times and the need for further stimulus to jumpstart the economy
183930 turn on a television in a battleground state and chances are that youll see an ad featuring obama talking about his work with lugar to stop the spread of nuclear weapons lugar has endorsed sen
183931 its his voice but im going inside his head to speak some psychological truth about him
183932 m uch of what goes on inside mccains head is neither mysterious nor hidden there is an elaborate record of the principles and beliefs that govern mccains thinking about politics and policy in the five books he and salter have written scores of speeches they have collaborated on over nearly two decades and countless interviews including one last week for this article
183933 that record reveals a complicated man whose approach to the world cannot be summed up in an aphorism or two he is a striver and a combatant often at war with himself who has conducted a lifelong struggle to prove to myself that i was the man i had always wanted to be as he has written multiple influences have shaped his thinking from his famous grandfather and father both four star navy admirals to his travels and his extensive reading of history and literature
183934 on many points the thinking is clear and consistent for example mccain believes in a muscular mission for america as he has put it our nation has a unique place in the world we are the greatest force for good on earth we chart historys course yes we must be involved in the destiny of other nations his favorite president is theodore roosevelt reformer at home activist wielder of a big stick abroad he has read edward gibbons six volume history of the decline and fall of the roman empire twice but his favorite book is ernest hemingways for whom the bell tolls whose protagonist robert jordan has been mccains hero since he was 13
183935 mccain has offered little analysis of the electorates reaction to him or the path he hopes to follow to victory in november
183936 two books that mccain has not read are the bestsellers written by obama
183937 does this combination of respect for obamas campaign and apparent indifference to his books suggest another example of mccains romantic fatalism salter the alter ego emphatically rejected that idea i can tell you right now
183938 we desperately need a president whos smarter than the average american and we desperately need a media willing to report the truth about candidates without trying to spin the story against them in a way that badly distorts reality
183939 mccain aides say their goal is to pre empt what they believe is obamas effort to paint any conventional campaign attacks as race based
183940 schmidt said mccain had learned the lesson of clintons campaign which began by taking her and her husbands affinity with african american voters for granted but wound up seeing days and weeks consumed by racially charged gaffes and allegations ranging from a new hampshire supporters suggestion that obama had dealt drugs to bill clintons own comparison of obamas campaign to the rev jesse jacksons
183941 i think the mccain camp watched our primary on the democratic side very carefully and they know that any accusation of racial divisiveness can be very very harmful for a candidates prospects wolfson said on fox news thursday adding that the allegations against clinton were unfair
183942 with his rejoinder about playing the race card mr davis effectively assured that race would once again become an unavoidable issue as voters face an election in which for the first time one of the major parties nominees is african american and with its criticism the mccain campaign was ensuring that mr obamas race he is the son of a black man from kenya and a white woman from kansas would again be a factor in coverage of the presidential race on thursday it took the spotlight from mr obama when he had sought to attack mr mccain on energy issues
183943 the tactic could cut both ways it might tap into the qualms some white working class voters in crucial swing states may have about a black candidate or it could ricochet back against the mccain campaign which has been accused even by some fellow republicans of engaging in overly negative campaigning in recent days
183944 obama has often talked about his physical appearance in campaign speeches but mccain advisers said he crossed a significant line by accusing the gop of scare tactics and alluding to his own race in the same breath
183945 the most negative abhorrent nasty vicious comment made in this race was the insinuation by barack obama that john mccain was going to run a racist campaign steve schmidt mccains chief strategist said in an interview
183946 obamas campaign denied the candidate suggested any such thing barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue

183960 i also dont do music for a particular audience i do it for anyone
183961 its bad business practice for me to spend close to r200 000 on an independent album i need to get my return on investment so its only sensible to make songs that id also buy if they were in an album im a consumer so all the songs that i make i know id consume
183962 if i cant do that then rapping is bad business and i need to bail out and do it for fun

183965 since the earth has survived massive meteors like the one that created the gulf of mexico massive volcanic eruptions that spewed millions of tons of ash into the atmosphere and incredibly large fires that charred millions and millions of acres and spewed tons of carbon into the atmosphere is man really capable of destroying the planet by burning the oil and coal that is in the planet

183970 i think its easy to take criticism negatively when you put years of work into honing a skill
183971 everyone has their own particular tastes and opinions and i respect differing perspectives as long as they are constructive
183972 i think bands should shut up and play good music i dont think the dirty work being done by a band absolves them from fair criticism as they are making a product to be consumed by an audience and the audience should be able to communicate with the band about how they receive that product i think fair and well directed criticism is important
183973 we want to be at the forefront of a new movement rather than following an already established one
183974 our priorities have shifted as with all dynamic bands and we have worked out that there is no such thing as a new idea only new combinations of old ideas we are trying to combine all our influences and tastes into a coherent sound that is exciting challenging and fun while still avoiding formulas and conventions
183975 but our sound has shifted so much over the last year that we are in desperate need of recording our new material so people can get an impression of what they would see live now
183976 gigging unless you are steve hofmeyr will not buy you that porsche youve been eyeing out smaller bands have to pursue other avenues or facets of the band such as merchandising and selling albums at shows
183977 we are all students and we have to juggle the band with varsity next year we plan to make the band a full time force and take it worldwide we want to travel and earn money doing what we love so being a professional band is the natural way to achieve that
183978 ill gauge our professionalism when i can throw a tv out the window and not be arrested

183983 when the reality of moving dawned on us we began to see the possibilities of operating in the big smoke
183984 the interaction we have with the kwaito hip hop and afro pop scene in gauteng is a fantastic experience that im not sure we could get in the mother city
183985 the south african music scene contains some of the coolest most genuine people you will ever meet so all of the hardships are really worth it
183986 the sa scene is really too small to accommodate many arseholes
183987 we recorded the original demo tracks in my bathroom on a single track mp3 player they were just a nice way to generate some early interest in the band
183988 some of those songs even made it onto the album
183989 no one will ever care about your band as much as you
183990 we are all south african and these are our experiences i write about things that are relevant to my life and to the lives of the people i interact with i hope that this comes across in the music i would consider that a triumph
183991 our music is a bit different and extremely south african so its not what the bigger corporate stations are used to playing im not sure if theyre ready for a white boy emcee with a dik sa accent quite yet
183992 personally i am not turned on by the bigger stations they seem to all pretty much play the same stuff its generally international garbage or local knock offs of that with some notable exceptions of course to be completely honest i cant really even bring myself to listen to the bigger stations so any commentary i make is really not even that well informed
183993 the gigs are still where its at thats what its all about
183994 with backpacking one gets to see many new places and gets to meet many people from all over the world
183995 its an excellent learning experience probably the best informal education
183996 as i had none of the above i borrowed r60 000 from a family member which almost caused a major fight in the family
183997 one of my best friends stood surety for r60 000 in return for a 20 equity stake we never had to use his surety so in effect he put in zero cash and still owns 20 basically he took the risk and was rewarded for doing so
183998 i personally went to all the hostels around the country put up posters and delivered brochures i started off with a hand made poster i couldnt afford to print them on shocking pink coloured paper because i thought that would definitely stand out among all the other posters at the hostels
183999 i just kept slugging it out while building up an excellent name and focussing on our marketing
184000 one thing i remember learning at university was that most companies go bankrupt when they grow too quickly that is very true we made that mistake when after about four years i sold a 60 shareholding and used the cash to buy more buses going from four busses to 11
184001 but i decided a few years ago not to im happy with the small operation i have now
184002 if i was not so passionate about the baz bus we would have stopped many many years ago
184003 ce qui m tonne cest l trange fascination quexerce sarkozy sur une partie de la gauche elle m me qui semble comme t tanis e juge t il mais imaginez ce quaurait dit la droite fran aise si c tait mitterrand qui avait agi ainsi avec tapie
184004 les raisons pour lesquelles javais indiqu que je ne voterais pas pour nicolas sarkozy qui reposaient sur un conflit de valeurs et non des antagonismes de personnes comme on a voulu le faire croire ne peuvent plus aujourdhui tre ignor es par personne
184005 il y a aujourdhui tr s peu de gens qui r sistent cette r alit admet le pr sident du modem les syndicats ont t d sarm s mis terre et moqu s et il ne faut pas oublier que beaucoup de gens ont peur cest pourquoi jai un devoir de rassemblement pour construire une opposition d mocratique et r publicaine
184006 vous tes le seul avoir dit depuis le premier jour ce qui se passe pr sent et on ne voulait pas vous croire
184007 o va t on sindigne le pr sident du modem quel r gime est on en train de mettre en place quelle soci t est on en train de construire
184008 jamais personne navait entra n la france l o nicolas sarkozy lentra ne aujourdhui affirme m bayrou il transgresse tout ce qui tait lessentiel du consensus r publicain
184009 laddition des d penses est l vidence absolument incompatible avec la ma trise du d ficit budg taire et le retour l quilibre de nos comptes publics a t il critiqu de m me est incompatible avec limp ratif de modernisation la concentration des pouvoirs au sommet de letat laquelle nous sommes en train dassister
184010 la soci t fran aise a besoin de responsabilit et de l gitimit et non de concentration des pouvoirs parce que je pense avec les fran ais que le gouvernement doit avoir sa chance et parce que je consid re que ces deux hypoth ques insurmontables p sent sur votre action nous nous abstiendrons
184011 le choix que vous avez fait qui est le contraire de ce qui tait pr vu et annonc va soumettre des tensions insupportables des secteurs entiers de laction publique de notre pays et ce dautant plus que nous sommes contraints une certaine discipline budg taire en raison de nos engagements europ ens
184012 si encore nous avions la certitude que le paquet fiscal allait dans le bon sens et permettait de relancer l conomie et la comp titivit peut tre pourrait on prendre ce risque mais les plus grands conomistes comme la plupart des instituts de conjoncture indiquent quau contraire vos choix ne vont pas dans la bonne direction
184013 je voulais donc vous alerter sur les risques que font courir vos choix aux finances publiques de notre pays et terme lensemble de nos quilibres conomiques
184014 le mal est profond mais o plonge t il ses racines dans la d pendance du l gislatif l gard de lex cutif cette d pendance remonte loin dans lhistoire de la v e r publique et elle a t renforc e par le raccourcissement de la dur e du mandat du pr sident de la r publique le quinquennat ayant rendu concomitantes les lections pr sidentielle et les lections l gislatives

184019 grobbies started to lose his eyesight in 2001 and today he only has five percent of his vision left he is my hero and it is sad that people like him dont have gold medals around their necks and that they remain as unknown behind the scenes role models he still inspires me to this day
184020 i do not think there is such a thing as being overconfident on a rugby field
184021 but if you believe that you are better than your opponent you are not only arrogant but na ve as well
184022 if you dont back yourself unconditionally and without limitations you cant expect your coach or your team mates to do so
184023 on the rugby field you are involved in warfare if you doubt your own abilities or play with reservations there will come a day when the opposition will trounce you
184024 i believe the game needs to be played as it unfolds and at number 10 there is ample opportunity to do just that i also like to be in the thick of things to make big important tackles on forwards if need be and to try and win the ball in the contact situation
184025 i was with my parents when i was selected for the springboks

184028 jake has retired as springbok coach on a high and i am glad for him

184057 but like many donors and their foundations neither abele nor argosy accepts unsolicited requests for gifts putting them right at the center of a philanthropic paradox many small nonprofits that stand to gain the most by tapping into the gusher of money expected to change hands in the coming decades are the least likely to cash in
184058 wed always back ourselves but we know its going to be difficult
184059 theres so much at stake not just in financial terms but in terms of prestige the competition in england is going to be an incredible experience and wed like to be there
184060 the fact that it looks like there is going to be a third place with the likelihood of zimbabwe withdrawing then it takes a wee bit of the pressure off
184061 it means if we lose in the semi final then were going to have a second chance to qualify that third and fourth place place off game will probably be the most tensed match of the entire competition
184062 we have a strong squad with players who are ideally suited to this form of the game
184063 in john blain and dewald nel i feel weve got the best new ball attack among the associate teams its such a bonus to have guys who take wickets up front and they do it consistently to peg back the opposition
184064 i open the batting in the one day format and i see no reason to change that gavin hamilton has started to open and has done quite well well also have navdeep poonia and kyle coetzer available from the counties so we have options
184065 unfortunately weve been hit with a few injuries our former captain craig wright misses out as he has a back injury that combined with the loss of gordon goudie means that there is an opportunity for the others to step up
184066 an opening fixture with ireland in ireland is about as tough as it gets as a tournament opener this should be a great one for fans of both countries
184067 in the twenty20 format anything can happen but i think ireland and scotland are the two favourite sides because they are playing in familiar conditions while we are coming from hot conditions
184068 we have worked extremely hard in england on a pre event tour and have made sure we have all the resources and have all bases covered
184069 we have to qualify for next years event because its extremely vital to the development of the game in kenya there is no point in having a good team that cannot perform
184070 i wasnt originally supposed to be in the squad but weve had a few injuries and ive been asked to come back in and help out
184071 were in a tough group but then there are no easy fixtures when you are at this level
184072 canada and kenya are strong teams but you have to look at yourself and your own strengths if we play to our potential then we will be hopeful of making it
184073 since this is a new concept players arent experienced enough which gives us a good chance to produce good results
184074 it is a fast paced format and you have to match that pace and the 11 players need to fire to get the desired results

184166 i just dont see anyone willing to invest in the amount of fund raising that they would have to do to challenge him if he gets in

184180 those rumors are being generated either by the wahhabis themselves or provocateurs straining for cheap sensationalism

184192 officers of the temporary operational police group of the russian interior ministry and servicemen of the interior troops engaged in a fight with about 30 gunmen in a forest three kilometers away from malye varandy in the grozny district on tuesday july 29 afternoon

184204 one thousand one hundred fifty eight is a pretty big number especially if youre talking about pages youve got to read to get your bearings war and peace long the standard for overwhelming verbiage weighs in at about 1 500 pages while on the other side your average harlequin romance novel is around 200 soapy pages none of these figures though are close to this whopper 452 billion so whats any of this got to do with the price of tomatoes as they say well nothing but its got a lot to do with the price of college and your taxes

184212 since the environment is not a person either real or incorporeal the environment can have no property rights that can be damaged by human action and resolved under tort law indeed the environment is not property subject to any human authority furthermore tracing specific human acts to actual permanent effects on the general physical environment let alone damages is a daunting task riddled with questionable assumptions if so environmental protection is a myth having no legal or ethical standing therefore laws purporting to protect the environment are invalid null and void prosecutions under them must be considered political scams because there is no identifiable property to examine for damage let alone specific culpability for the consequences without a property issue there can be no determinate cause and effect in society and thus no resolvable question of justice or welfare
184213 we have forgotten about our closest source of water at home the tap yet one of the simplest ways to reduce our environmental impact to save money not a ton yet and to free ourselves from shopping and storage hassle is by saying goodbye to bottled water a life cycle assessment commissioned by the swiss gas and water association traced the entire life cycle from water extraction to serving it up in a glass their findings showed that tap water has less than one percent of the impacts of un refrigerated bottled water even when the tap water is refrigerated its impact is only one quarter of that of bottled water these astonishing figures show that tap water is hands down the greenest and most responsible choice

184216 in most schools every 15 minutes takes the form of a theatrical happening stretched out over two days a student dressed as the grim reaper arrives and chooses a classmate for death the reaper then returns every 15 minutes to take another life in order to emphasize the completely dubious statistic from which the program takes its name on average they claim someone is killed every 15 minutes in an alcohol related accident the dead students are decked out in white face makeup and black t shirts available in poly cotton mix with a grim reaper logo for only 6 25 at every15minutes com they walk among the living but arent allowed to talk to anyone for the rest of the day which many high school students may actually consider a fate worse than death and who pays for all this bounty why taxpayers of course primarily via small grants from the would be reformers at state and local highway departments offices of public safety fire departments and city councils

184226 we have a dream today that someday soon this will not be an anniversary of sadness but an anniversary of justice restored
184227 i think we could move beyond the fundamental abortion question and start talking about other aspects of family planning
184228 traditional marriage is itself a pledge and i will take a pledge to defend it
184229 some issues are too important to play the field with
184230 homosexual advocacy groups are being funded by grants from the state department of health under his authority
184231 additionally under governor pawlentys supervision his administration is actively promoting the indoctrination of students into a homosexual worldview and value system
184232 the end game in all of this is a legal imposition of homosexual marriage upon the state of minnesota
184233 offers tremendous opportunities to improve human health and well being by addressing serious diseases such as diabetes and alzheimers as a matter of public policy stem cell research deserves careful consideration and bipartisan support
184234 nowhere in the legislation are the rights and interests of the born or unborn child mentioned in regard to anything
184235 the bill also fails in any manner to recognize or protect the life and rights of the unborn child
184236 we were told by the governors staff that the minnesota family council would have had to sign off on whatever negotiated agreement we have
184237 i was unaware that the family council had an election certificate
184238 our global climate is warming at least in part due to the energy sources we use
184239 and he expects us to act measured and responsible in that regard
184240 sleep disordered breathing and mortality eighteen year follow up of the wisconsin sleep cohort

184242 china has become a notable factor in the scientific landscape usually scientific development in nations does not show such a strong acceleration as we have seen in china so it will be interesting to see how it responds and develops in the future
184243 we now know that the immune system of patients recovering from chemotherapy is malleable so we just need to find the best immunologic approach to exploit this window of opportunity
184244 the good news was the surprisingly nice t cell response patients had to the flu vaccination even relatively soon after completing chemotherapy
184245 that shows that the general idea of using immunotherapy following chemotherapy to prevent recurrence is not a flawed one chemotherapy depleted the immune system but we could restore it
184246 was not very immunogenic we have a long way to go to optimizing this vaccine
184247 methadone kills sensitive leukemia cells and also breaks treatment resistance but without any toxic effects on non leukemic blood cells
184248 we find this very exciting because once conventional treatments have failed a patient which occurs in old and also in young patients they have no other options
184249 addiction shouldnt be an unsolvable problem if methadone is ever used as an anti cancer therapy
184250 with working memory youre just keeping it active until you use it
184251 thats the test where we really saw the most striking effects with estradiol
184252 rats treated with estradiol are definitely a lot more active and make a lot more lever presses
184253 women take them thinking theyll be a safe alternative to hormone replacement therapy and they might help hot flashes
184254 of those women we were able to follow 418 women who gave birth vaginally had a second child or more were tested for gbs during their first and second pregnancies and were not excluded from the study due to various factors we found that of the 418 the risk of testing positive for gbs during a second pregnancy was 53 percent
184255 our study did not tackle this issue but the results could help experts decide whether it is cost effective to keep testing women in subsequent pregnancies if their risk of testing positive remains so high
184256 the test involves a swab of the vaginal rectal area if a woman tests positive and is therefore considered colonized she will most likely be treated with intravenous iv antibiotic therapy during labor the antibiotics will help protect the infant
184257 with obama all we can say is that americans need to be careful had he been less in a hurry had he been not so eager for ultimate power so quickly the country could have gotten to know him as a man in full but he is in a hurry and so those marking a ballot for him nov 4 should understand the risk
184258 the current monetary policy efforts aimed at controlling inflation are having the exact opposite effect with capacity expansion being deferred and have the real risk of causing stagflation
184259 however the relative sudden increase in soybean aphid activity indicates that we need to be more alert
184260 when the numbers of aphids are large enough estimates will speed up the process sampling more plants will provide a more precise estimate of the average density of soybean aphids but time is a consideration nonetheless its important to obtain an estimate of the average number of soybean aphids field wide large colonies usually begin on only a few plants and the population may or may not build depending on environmental conditions and the presence or absence of natural enemies such as multicolored asian lady beetles insidious flower bugs and syrphid fly larvae wet and humid weather also will increase the likelihood of an epizootic of fungal pathogens that can suppress soybean aphid populations

184313 we have a big problem as long as those who arrested him dont return the laptop and the 50 cds containing the entire defence of radovan karadzic had prepared for 10 years
184314 radovan karadzic does not know if he will be able to appear on august 29
184315 it was like something between a dog howling and a baby crying i guess you could say i dont think it will leave me for a while
184316 mr holbrooke undertook on behalf of the usa that i would not be tried before this tribunal
184317 not only from public but also from party offices and completely disappear from the public arena not give interviews and not even publish literary works in a word become invisible long enough for the dayton agreement to be implemented in full
184318 that i get out of the way and go to russia greece or serbia and open a private clinic just as long as i left pale
184319 it is clear that unable to fulfill the commitments he had undertaken on behalf of the usa he holbrooke switched to plan b the liquidation of radovan karadzic
184320 the agreement which should have brought me peace and freedom thus became a source of great danger to my life and to the life and safety of my family and even my friends
184321 holbrooke s wish for my disappearance is today still fresher and stronger and the actions aimed at bringing this about are tireless
184322 while these activities continue and with this threat to my life i have to sit in a place which is known to him and his friends and prepare my defence
184323 i was in danger of being liquidated because i had made a commitment
184324 i cannot imagine that his defence would be anything but a political one
184325 the family has always said they have evidence of proof of the secret agreement
184326 the markets attention will turn today friday to the release of the us employment report for july
184327 we believe that the report is likely to reinforce the deteriorating labour market trend

184336 raising consumption tax is something everyone thinks when thinking about rebuilding the government finance
184337 my task will be to study what impact this situation would have on ordinary people and the economy in the short term and what the finance ministry can do
184338 what i am worried about the most is the higher prices of commodities such as rising oil prices
184339 naming yosano for the post means that the prime minister endorses tighter spending and higher taxes for financial reform
184340 ibuki was a former finance ministry bureaucrat so i believe he also prefers raising taxes
184341 yosano and ibuki will take a similar position in that sense
184342 the market will not welcome the choice of those who will likely pursue a tax hike when the economy remains gloomy

184345 it was a party so its not like we went that deep
184346 but i think we talked about casper my french bulldog and how much we both think the butterfly stroke sucks
184347 i guess i was probably reading too much into his clothes but i just assumed that he would be into certain things like maybe he would like whit stillman and the dirty projectors or at the very least wes anderson and vampire weekend
184348 i should have listened to my gut instincts then and there and realized that was a red flag who like gets my number calls me and asks me on a date is this mad men but i guess i was kinda flattered so i said yes
184349 i knew the burgers there werent organic or anything but i didnt want to be that person on a first date so i didnt say anything
184350 at first i thought clay was wearing khakis i thought there was no way that would be possible but as he got closer and closer i realized he was definitely wearing khakis khakis with pleats and one of those polo shirts with the giant logo the size of your hand
184351 i told myself that maybe he was making some kind of weird meta statement about how much first dates resemble job interviews so i just kissed his cheek and we went inside
184352 i told him i had gone to this todd p show at death by audio and he asked me who todd p was and then oh my god this is so bananas he told me he had gone to some murray hill bar with his old teammates from the middlebury lacrosse team thats when i knew this was never going to work
184353 look i dont want to call them hipsters she says trailing off

184357 because the tide came in the animal was having great difficulty in righting itself and water was starting to lap around the blow hole
184358 a decision was taken to put the animal to sleep on welfare grounds
184359 as they made their way to the animal it did manage to right itself and it is now free swimming but in fairly shallow water so right now the prognosis is not good
184360 when an animal restrands for a second time it is often very poorly by that stage
184361 at the moment the animal is bobbing around but if and when this animal comes back in it will have to be euthanised
184362 theres no coming back from renal failure its not good news but is what we expect from these cases
184363 renal failure is predominantly due to dehydration because it hasnt eaten for at least 48 hours but it could well be longer than that
184364 muscle damage will also be a contributing factor from when it was stranded

184367 for men its less of a shortfall when they are older because thats when they tend to be married and when women have already experienced things like divorce and widowhood
184368 for women often children are very important and more fulfilling than for men so that can be something that sustains their satisfaction with family life
184369 usually people who are married have a better financial situation since often they have double incomes
184370 they also are more likely to fulfill their financial aspirations
184371 its generally assumed including by public policy makers whether youre healthy and you own a lot of stuff are the two most important things in whether you are satisfied in life
184372 and research consistently does not find this including this study
184373 in economic theory one of the assumptions is that preferences are stable so you basically dont change your wants but we see the wants do change that people really adapt to achievement
184374 so when they attain goods then they want more goods
184375 what that means for happiness is quite interesting it means that when you acquire something in the material goods domain it will not really increase your happiness because you just adjust your aspirations

184377 the psuv is confronting a new challenge to create a strong youth organisation that wont be an answer to the right wing youth but that converts into the launching point of socialist politics in venezuela
184378 owing to the historic social process that venezuelan is experiencing at the moment the youth have had a protagonist role in the construction of the bolivarian process and have also had an important role in the leadership of it however because we live in a capitalist country a lot of the youth arent participating in the process of change and are easily manipulated and alienated by the capitalist system
184379 from my point of view political consciousness today is critical because we are living in a period of change the youth of venezuela are divided in two those who are with the revolutionary struggle and those who are against it those who are with it are ready to struggle until the end for the objectives of the revolution
184380 speaking in general terms the youth still dont have a high level of consciousness but of course there are many exceptions young people who are planting seeds of consciousness however people are starting to have consciousness the fact that young people are incorporated in the communal councils and so on shows that something is happening and the consciousness is starting to increase but theres also a long way to go the large majority of the youth are still thinking about earning money and living a life of luxury
184381 the consciousness of venezuelan youth in the first instance is formed by global consciousness that is the absence of class consciousness only the poor sectors and some students are taking on the challenge of the transformation and the rebellion of the revolution
184382 revolutionary consciousness is being born were learning about ourselves our history and our origins lessons that are necessary for the emancipation of the latin american people
184383 the youth are in the bolivarian circles the social fronts such as the frente francisco de miranda and so on there are militant youth in the left wing parties and the social and popular movements and the communal councils the thing is the youth are dispersed and there are more youth in the social fronts than in the inj national institute of youth for example
184384 a number of groups have been formed ffm groups based on ches philosophy the university groups the youth of the communist party and of the patria para todos homeland for all and the obe the organisation of the high school students
184385 in terms of the party and the people in government the majority of youth are linked in some way to the university but in the government programs the missions and so on the majority are youth who arent in the university together though we are involved in everything we are workers farmers students etc
184386 young people are in the student movements are workers are in the communal councils the military reserve the youth of the communist party the instituto nacional de juventud national institute of youth the network of young writers and fronts of musicians artists prostitutes homosexual etc the majority of the venezuelan population is young
184387 the youth are made up of people who are starting to study and are in the missions studying in the mission che guevara for example who are learning philosophy and another way to live these are the true revolutionary youth
184388 at the moment the youth have been mostly participating in a passive way it would be better if they took on a more protagonistic role in the process with all the responsibility that this involves
184389 i think that now the revolutionary youth are very dispersed they see socialism from different points of view and in the end we clash we need to unify criteria and define the socialism that we want so that we have just one objective
184390 when chavez first became the president a lot of the old corrupt layers of people joined the process thinking about what they could personally gain from it the role of the youth is to learn what revolution is the theory of it and to see an end to this cancer of corruption the youth need to incorporate themselves and replace these people the youth are the hope of this process and they should take the reins in the psuv to guard the line of the government because one of the priorities of the revolution right now is to maintain the power we have
184391 the role of the youth in the revolution is indispensable it should be to put pressure on the process of discussion and criticism and furthermore it should be to substitute the old standards that make politics actually the youth here have taken on the challenge of construction transformation and subversion of the established order we now have institutions specifically oriented to the youth things which didnt exist under past governments and we are the vanguard of this revolution it will depend on us the youth to maintain and strength it
184392 all the youth have to identify with history and understand what it means to liberate the historical role that weve had in the past is an example and we must be continuers of the project of bolivar were learning that we have a certain identity linked to the liberation of the people
184393 one of the particularities of the bolivarian process is the central role the youth are playing in working in the community and with the most dispossessed social sectors however the youth have lost a lot of their rebellious character and today in the universities and student centres the youth are colliding with two different visions of the world one that defends the transformation and change for the wellbeing of everyone and the other that protects the capitalist model
184394 historically since venezuelas independence the youth have had an important role venezuela obtained its liberty in a large battle the victory battle fought by the youth also a group of young people were the ones who managed to topple the dictatorial regime in venezuela on january 23 1958 and today its the youth who lead venezuela in the revolution there are many young people working in the institutions of the revolution the role of the youth isnt to struggle against the opposition in the university but to contribute to the formation of the other young people in a conscious revolutionary way
184395 the students should have a fundamental role in the revolution but they still havent had the opportunity to be the vanguard something for which we are struggling the struggle consists in the formation of the consciousness of the youth because the problem is that a large part of the youth are opposition and are defending the interests of the venezuelan oligarchy including imitating the role that the youth had in the old yugoslavia the youth are weak because the media manipulates them they are trapped in fashion of clothes music etc and dont have the capacity to analyse well
184396 the universities class composition is mostly upper and middle class therefore the students within the autonomous university education system take on the logic of the bourgeois class of the country and this in turn corresponds to their political action that is they are against everything that is implied by the collective by the new economy and are against revolution or socialism they are the organisations and movements who have direct links with the cia for example they brought the us ambassador to talk at a forum and they fight with the revolutionary students on the university their discourse is similar to that of the youth in santa cruz bolivia there is also clear racism on the universities
184397 its different because in the years before the process of change the students carried the flag of resistance to imperialism and neoliberalism but what happened is that this movement left the university and went to work in the missions and this space was abandoned now the counterrevolutionary culture has taken the leadership the teachers on the university lie and so you have young people who arrive at the university at just 17 18 years of age and they dont have consciousness or political knowledge they are taught to identify with the status of the teachers and without a political foundation they cant criticise
184398 the youth should be the transformers and should aim to finish with the current reform model they should organise themselves as a youth front so that they can have a voice in the leadership and deepen the bolivarian process and increase the morale of the venezuelan people
184399 within the psuv first in my opinion the party should create a functional structure for the youth where its defined what our function or field of action is within the party so that we can call to action the young people who still arent involved directly with the party because the psuv hasnt yet developed a strategy directed by the youth that is even though there are a lot of young people in the party they dont have a collective line they dont have their own values just lines handed down by chavez
184400 the role that we should have is mainly in the bases with the people working with ideological formation and without forgetting at any moment the spaces of power as to how we should organise it should be an organisation that is completely participative horizontal where everyone has the right to give their opinion and we should work for the inclusion of those who still havent understood the role of the psuv in the revolution
184401 first were going to take the space of power within the party as youth and political leaders as well the way we organise should be in agreement with the natural space that we occupy as young people in the same way that farmers do in the farmer front and so on
184402 the youth of the psuv cant fail and commit the errors that weve committed in the past when we stop being young when we become parents and so on we become absorbed into the system so as young people we must be an example for the country of community work etc and be the vanguard of change the youth are the ones who will achieve the objectives of the revolution as youth we have nothing to lose and everything to gain the youth are the hope of the world
184403 most of the players id say about 99 9 per cent want to go to the olympics this is a big big big deal
184404 guys want to go but theyre just being held back by their clubs theyre important for their clubs and you can understand it but i think its a great rule that they have to be released
184405 we are clearly in a growth recession and my fear is that we are in a mild but longer recession than the one we experienced in 2001 2002
184406 overall the report looks to be broadly consistent with other data that show the economy quite soft basically stalled not growing very much but not contracting very much either
184407 he had a big cut on his hand he sustained it while he was working he filed a leave to their employer but it was denied my husband just wanted to take a rest and let his wound heal

184417 its really so horrible obviously my relationship with clark is still going strong and were always trying to figure out if were in love or just friends or whats going on and then shes got jimmy whos just this beautiful amazing supportive stable realistic man who i think she really seeks to find solace in and kind of uses as a way to ground herself in some sort of sense of stability she goes to him a lot when things feel kind of crazy but now shes got this new hero the paramedic davis guy who is pursuing her pretty actively and is incredibly attractive and very kind and interesting and also a little dark so shes really got three to choose from and then theres the green arrow and hes just like whatever hes just fun to play with
184418 its awesome i mean im learning more and more about the comics as we go because i dont know a lot about the superman comics so just finding out a couple weeks ago that doomsday actually kills clark i mean kills superman in the comics and being a part of a struggle between the dark and the light side again i think is really exciting so im looking forward to it and sam is a wonderful actor and so charming so i am having a lot of fun playing with him
184419 i dont foresee my storyline crossing over with him too much just because i have a lot going on with isis and davis and jimmy and then my own super powers that are kind of happening it would probably be more with cassidy freeman and tom welling but its possible i mean ive got my nose in everything so its possible
184420 well see that bald head again hes not gone for good
184421 no because theyre still very much a part of our lives
184422 were like a train we just keep going and forging ahead we miss them dearly and we love them and we talk about them and think about them all the time but were making a show man we cant slow down
184423 im directing this year so thats a totally new beast to tackle so im looking at the show in a very different way
184424 also theres something so wonderful about the family that weve developed and so coming back it doesnt just feel like im coming back to work on smallville it really feels like im coming home in a lot of ways so its really nice to be able to come back and enjoy that and kind of fall into the warm embrace of the family thats being built there
184425 i dont know shes really diving head first into the isis foundation and shes really taking on the job of being a mentor and that kind of place of solace for the meteor infected and so i think that thats really going to be her focus and i think shes pretty angry at lex luthor so shes going to stay as far away from him and his cohorts as possible
184426 i think that the most fun for me has been the fact that my path as this character has not been anything secure so weve really been able to work in quite an equal partnership the writers myself and the fans in shaping who this character is going to be and shaping the direction shes going to go i really like the fact that everything is new and that were really molding a brand new character together as far as my characters evolution my favorite part is just how honorable she is i think that if i was to choose any female character on television to play right now chloe would definitely be in my top three because i think that shes just a great just integrous and loyal and strong woman and i dont think that we have a lot of those on tv for young women to look at so im very proud
184427 all three of those women really exemplify strength and intelligence and i like that
184428 its time for him to grow up a little bit and not rely on chloe so much so that chloe can go off and forge her own path
184429 shes been his shadow for a really long time and has been doing things of great importance but i think its really exciting this year to see her forge her own way and figure out what shes passionate about and figure out how she wants to do that which you really start to see her do at the isis foundation and shes really narrowing down her scope of what she wants to focus on shes trying to help that part of the population in the world and i think thats really cool
184430 i think chloes really taking on the whole mother teresa kind of thing thats been looming around since she started with her healing super power a couple of seasons ago shes got such a huge heart and shes recognizing that theres more people out there that need her other than clark kent which is another reason why i think shes starting to cut the apron strings and let clark venture into his own sort of thing because shes really seeing how many people need her help and bette is just the first of i think many
184431 i dont think chloe would stop until she actually couldnt go any more like physically fell over so i think shes just going to take things on until she cant
184432 ive been acting for 22 years and i love film so much and i love the whole process of making films its just sort of the next step of understanding it on a deeper level i always liked telling stories in whatever fashion i can and directing is just understanding and learning a different element to the storytelling process
184433 i think its so cool i mean what an amazing honor to have a character written after you i think its so cool so im thrilled about the opportunity and about the possibility and i hope to see it come to fruition

184457 the scientific community is really going to run with this
184458 this discovery in the nocera lab demonstrates that moving up the transformation of our energy supply system to one based on renewables will depend heavily on frontier basic science
184459 we simply want to place as many of our bush loyalists as possible
184460 the bush administration is unprecedented in how systematic the politicization is and how it extends both across the wider organization chart and deep down within the bureaucracy
184461 theyve been very consistent from day 1 in learning the lessons of previous administrations and pushing those tactics to the limit

184478 if anyone representing wal mart gave the impression we were telling associates how to vote they were wrong and acting without approval
184479 we believe efca is a bad bill and we have been on record as opposing it for some time
184480 we feel educating our associates about the bill is the right thing to do
184481 we feel its important that our employee partners fully understand the implications that the employee free choice act could have on their work environment and benefits
184482 weve always maintained the termination was not related to the union and that there was nothing unlawful about an answer provided an associate about merit pay
184483 following the decision we were considering offering reinstatement but that is on hold since the union appealed the decision
184484 this is a david and goliath confrontation but we believe well have enough stones in the sling to knock this out

184568 i heard buddy bark and then screech then heard silence
184569 is that really the best you can come up with
184570 but its deeply unfair to suggest his criticism of obama was race based president clinton was a force for unity in this country on this subject every american should be proud of his record as both a governor and president but we knew it was coming in our direction because they did it against a president of the united state of their own party
184571 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
184572 hes not from central casting when it comes to presidents of the united states hes young hes new to washington yes hes african american
184573 what barack obama was talking about was that he didnt get here after spending decades in washington there is nothing more to this than the fact that he was describing that he was new to the political scene he was referring to the fact that he didnt come into the race with the history of others it is not about race
184574 refer a friend and both of you can make 50
184575 it is fair to say that the musical theatre revue in its usual form has been done to death over the years i have come to feel that if youve seen one diva standing in a black dress gurning her way through
184576 so we have trawled the archives to find some real gems from relatively unknown shows songs that will sit happily alongside more recognisable numbers from shows such as
184577 most cabaret shows break the fourth wall that is the performers speak directly to the audience telling them all about the songs and the shows
184578 and the key thing is that the songs fit into and serve the narrative so songs that were originally written as part of a narrative through line are presented as such here albeit not always in the same setting as they were originally intended
184579 arise shine for your light has come and the glory of the
184580 do not be anxious about anything but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to god and the peace of god which surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and minds in christ jesus finally brothers whatever is true whatever is honorable whatever is just whatever is pure whatever is lovely whatever is commendable if there is any excellence if there is anything worthy of praise think about these things what you have learned and received and heard and seen in me practice these things and the peace of god will be with you

184593 a network executive seeking to explain msnbcs apparent kidnapping of its own footage spoke of his companys public interest obligations
184594 viewers are incredibly engaged this election season with a real appetite for political news
184595 but sometimes for viewers own good and to maintain our good standing in the village we have to self censor some truths are just too painful and we have a responsibility to protect the public as well as inform them
184596 they will just say its a laugh and that it doesnt mean anything but wait until one of their family members is a victim of knife crime and then see what they say
184597 yes stevens is the longest sitting senator and could be facing jail time but on the other hand this cat is enormous
184598 it broke me heart i wanted him to have a good home
184599 im surprised that some people actually use digg to refer fox news i have seen that most people who use digg are liberals who hate and trash fox news however im sure someone will say some crap about fox news right now
184600 bah thats the lazy way in my day we had one missing semi colon and had to hunt for 3 days before writing the whole damned thing from scratch

184603 the inner core could be comparable to the earths surface but with more subdued variations
184604 our mission is to bring vitality to everyones life at surprisingly affordable prices we want to spread awareness about the health benefits of spa therapies they reduce stress enhance mood and detoxify the body we already have two spas located in the neighbourhoods of koregaon park and aundh we plan to expand to 12 day spas in mumbai pune and delhi by march end next year
184605 while five star spas offer spa therapies at prices above rs 2 000 we offer the same therapies at a surprisingly affordable price of rs 699
184606 we do not want our guests to travel to and fro for three hours our spas idea revolves around relaxation if our guests spend time on travelling and get tired it does not serve our purpose of creating an ambience of relaxation
184607 our spa team helps guests understand various spa therapies and assists them in selecting the therapies that best suits them
184608 we provide individual shower enclosures in every therapy room and disposable undergarments to our guests this ensures highest level of privacy and hygiene
184609 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
184610 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
184611 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body
184612 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed i imagine it would be pretty traumatic
184613 this particular incident as horrific as it is is obviously extremely rare

184622 so grab your pick axe and get back down in that coal mine because i think i saw some happiness down there yesterday quit being a wuss the toxic fumes will only put hairs on your chest and extra nipples
184623 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
184624 we are not going to let anybody paint john mccain who has fought his entire life for equal rights for everyone to be able to be painted as racist
184625 weve seen this happen before and were not going to let it happen to us
184626 what barack obama was saying is hes not exactly from central casting for presidential candidates
184627 were not going negative in return were refuting the charges
184628 its a great ad and everybodys talking about it and were having a great time with it
184629 while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
184630 all about the beat why hip hop cant save black america
184631 of course obama and his people have to condemn the rap because it does say some vulgar things
184632 if youre running for president youre supposed to be an upstanding individual
184633 theyre thinking an obama who knows how to play the game is still better for me than a mccain
184634 there are a ton of people who clearly are looking for obama to denounce this in order to continue to view him as credible
184635 he for political purposes has to separate himself from anything controversially black
184636 im not aware of hip hop music affecting any election so far and i dont think that this is going to be one either
184637 theres no doubt that hip hop culture moves our young people powerfully and some of it is not just a reflection of reality
184638 it also creates reality i think that if all our kids see is a glorification of materialism and bling and casual sex and kids are never seeing themselves reflected as hitting the books and being responsible and delaying gratification then they are getting an unrealistic picture of what the world is like
184639 lets get free strategies for organizing the hip hop voting bloc
184640 before a lot of the songs about barack were supporting his campaign
184641 this song is different in that it almost claims the victory thats scary for some people who dont want to see that happen
184642 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
184643 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
184644 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
184645 we werent suggesting in any way hes using race as an issue
184646 is using the same old low road politics that voters are very unhappy about to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
184647 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
184648 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
184649 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
184650 so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton
184651 i respect and admire sen obama we just have stark differences
184652 campaigns are tough but im proud of the campaign we have run
184653 im proud of the issues we have tried to address with the american people all i can say is we are proud of that commercial
184654 we can most assuredly tell you that voters around the country do not think theres anything substantive about this latest ad do not think its something that john mccain should be proud of
184655 i know that i dont look like the americans whove previously spoken in this great city
184656 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
184657 look at sand in your hand when you squeeze your hand that sand will fall out and if you keep squeezing you will eventually loose all the sand in your hand but if you just hold your hand out and just support the sand in your hand it will stay
184658 finally brothers whatever is true whatever is noble whatever is right whatever is pure whatever is lovely whatever is admirable if anything is excellent or praiseworthy think about such things
184659 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
184660 you have value on the ground more than you spent
184661 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
184662 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
184663 when she made it clear she didnt want to have anything to do with him he became enraged
184664 after they made a deal they were following her to another motel room when they were approached by three males from behind and forced into a room at gunpoint
184665 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
184666 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
184667 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
184668 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
184669 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
184670 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
184671 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
184672 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
184673 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
184674 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
184675 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
184676 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
184677 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
184678 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
184679 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
184680 the brazilian find sits thousands of feet below the surface and only the major drillers can get to that oil other fields in russia the north sea and off the coast of indonesia require the drillers
184681 the order backlog has become enormous and following the brazilian offshore find will create an even deeper backlog its time to boost our allocation to the oil equipment and services companies
184682 the leading drillers in my opinion are still undervalued relative to their earnings prospects and one great company that still trades less than its projected earnings and cash flow over the next 12 months is dallas based ensco a premier global offshore drilling contractor
184683 its services are essential to oil companies in their worldwide exploration and development efforts its fleet of 52 rigs including six ultra deepwater semi submersible rigs under construction is strategically located in the most prolific domestic and international oil and gas markets
184684 in early 2001 esv completed construction of its first deepwater semi submersible rig which has proven to be a cost effective solution to deepwater drilling t
184685 he company has embarked on construction of six additional ultra deepwater semis the first is scheduled to be delivered in the third quarter of 2008 with the others following in 2009 2010 2011 and 2012 wfc reported excellent numbers and also hiked their dividend

184688 but analog is still a rapidly growing part of the semiconductor business
184689 digital chips which store data in ones and zeroes operate by differentiating between on and off signals
184690 analog chips by contrast process gradations and are able to process waveforms such as speech music and video so analog chips create a bridge to the digital world where data is stored and manipulated
184691 digital chips themselves are ill suited for communicating as digital circuits shrink to ever smaller sizes the value in the analog portion that doesnt scale well continues to rise
184692 a year ago i would not have recommended analog devices the company was struggling from 2004 to 2007 adi posted a 1 compounded annual growth rate in revenues and earnings per share
184693 during that time the company was a provider of handset basebands modems inside a phone which really became a commodity business it was also in the pc power management businesses which was also a drag on the overall growth of the company
184694 the good news is that during the first quarter adi got out of these businesses and has taken steps to move from single digital earning growth to double digit growth adi looks set to deliver double digit growth of 13 five year cagr much ofthat growth is coming from its communications business
184695 wireless carriers have been upgrading to third generation 3g networks over the past year and many now are focusing their sites on building fourth generation 4g networks as well as wimax networks
184696 with each move up the idea is to provide higher data rates allowing for more applications to run at once and for higher quality pictures and video as a result i think this stock looks very attractive
184697 the biggest part ofadis analog business is products for its industrial and communications business which account for 72 of revenues within this business adis wireless base station revenues grew significantly over the past year
184698 manufacturers of base stations which are radio receiver transmitters that serve as the hub of the local wireless network have been td scdma the chinese version of 3g equipment
184699 i expect adi to generate revenues of 2 6 billion in fiscal 2008 up 7 year over year earnings per share should grow 14 in 2008 and maybe 17 if you include stock buybacks in addition to the share repurchases adi paid a dividend of 0 20 per share in the most recent quarter translating into a yield of about 3 and the company has no debt wfc reported excellent numbers and also hiked their dividend

184794 lampedusa is on its knees and we need an urgent visit from the interior minister roberto maroni so he can see the dilemma we face
184795 the time has come for this to stop and for a solution to this problem to be found once and for all the needs of the people of lampedusa are being forgotten
184796 we have seen a 30 per cent drop in tourism and we have also down to just one daily flight between the island and lampedusa and we have other pressing problems such as drainage and sanitation which are not being dealt with

184801 students like me were given visas and scholarships complete financial aid mind you and invited into the ranks of the meritocracy
184802 i had not shaved my two week old beard it was perhaps a form of protest on my part a symbol of my identity or perhaps i sought to remind myself of the reality i had just left behind i do not now recall my precise motivations i know only that i did not wish to blend in with the army of clean shaven youngsters who were my coworkers and that inside me for multiple reasons i was deeply angry
184803 i wondered how it was that america was able to wreak such havoc in the world orchestrating an entire war in afghanistan say and legitimizing through its actions the invasion of weaker states by more powerful ones which india was now proposing to do in pakistan with so few apparent consequences at home

184815 wir d rfen es nicht zulassen dass es hnlich wie im wahlkampf im deutschen hessen zu einem aufeinanderhetzen von generationen kommt die bek mpfung der kriminalit t ist zu wichtig um sie f r un berlegte populistische wahlkampfparolen zu missbrauchen
184816 wir m ssen das problem ernst nehmen allerdings ohne die jungen menschen zu verunglimpfen es ist falsch pauschal zu behaupten dass jugendlichen das unrechtsbewusstsein fehlt schlie lich ist die heutige jugend die trotz erschwerter bedingungen wie einer turboglobalisierung die es mit sich bringt dass unsichere besch ftigungsverh ltnisse und ein berh hter leistungsdruck bestehen eine tolle und vielf ltige jugend
184817 jugendkriminalit t ist ein ernstes thema da bedarf es keiner marktschreierischen sondern einer neuen l sungsorientierten politik wie ich bereits in der pensionsfrage gegen ein aufhetzen der generationen argumentiert habe appelliere ich jetzt wieder nicht eine ganze generation junger menschen zu verurteilen indem man ihnen erkl rt es fehle ihnen allen an unrechtsbewusstsein
184818 one can suspend a vm and bring it back up from the command line thats the route ive chosen this works for me because our vms while very active do not have large disk images less than say 5 minutes sata gt sata the strategy ive chosen is to set the home directory for my vms iterate through them suspend them copy the data to another location and resume the vm that gives me minimal downtime gives me 1 backup right there and gives me the data that i can tar and compress and transfer off site at my leisure from there while the vms are doing whatever it is they do

184823 schlichtweg falsch und typisch sind die behauptungen der wiener sp dass die verantwortung f r die gerichtsmedizin einzig und allein beim bund liegt
184824 richtig ist vielmehr dass sich die gruppe der beteiligten aus der stadt wien dem justizministerium und der medizin universit t zusammen setzt das bundesministerium f r wissenschaft und forschung ist hier vor allem in seiner funktion als aufsichtsorgan der universit t vertreten
184825 f r die sanit tsbeh rdlichen obduktionen war und ist die stadt wien zust ndig und niemand sonst sie profitiert also ma geblich von der gerichtsmedizin der medizinischen universit t wien und es w re h chste zeit dass sich die wiener sp ihrer zust ndigkeit besinnt
184826 die aktuelle situation ist schon lange bekannt und die stadt wien hat es bis jetzt verabs umt an ihren spit lern die notwendigen r umlichkeiten zur verf gung zu stellen
184827 ich begr e es daher sehr dass sich gesundheitsministerin andrea kdolsky als mediatorin eingeschaltet hat und hoffe dass an diesem tisch jetzt auch die stadt wien bewegung zeigt und ihre verantwortung endlich wahr nimmt

184833 weve found that cb1 expression is lost in most colorectal cancers and when that happens a cancer promoting protein is free to inhibit cell death
184834 potential application of cannabinoids as anti tumor drugs is an exciting prospect because cannabinoid agonists synthetic molecules that mimic the action of natural molecules are being evaluated now to treat the side effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy
184835 turning cb1 back on and than treating with a cannabinoid agonist could provide a new approach to colorectal cancer treatment or prevention

184866 how to make a cappuccino on a budget espresso machine
184867 in that respect the negative cash flow in the second quarter is overstated
184868 were going to get the second quarter behind us and just move ahead
184869 as our recent product capacity and liquidity actions clearly demonstrate we are reacting rapidly to the challenges facing the u s economy and auto market and we continue to take the aggressive steps necessary to transform our u s operations
184870 this is a half a billion dollar project you have to allow us to question the experts you have to
184871 ruth you cant do this you have to allow councilmembers ask good questions and hard questions
184872 greenwald had the audacity to question a couple of projects that might just break the civic piggy bank before all is said and done wrote claire st
184873 when i first read those numbers i was certain it was a misprint surely it must be 2 5 million and 2 million greenwald removed all doubt about the proper placement of decimal points when she said i have yet to see what shape well be in after we pay off a half billion dollars in debt hey thats one of the advantages of having 65 000 people in town as daunting as the figure sounds its only about 7 000 per resident or 35 000 for a family of five and if wed all agree to stop watering the lawn not to mention showering just once a week whether we need it or not we may be able to bring that cost down by a dollar or two

184881 and evidently britney spears has gone straight now in terms of cleaning her act up so basically paparazzi are losing interest
184882 the federal law does not compel the states to impose criminal penalties for marijuana possession
184883 the purpose of the federal law is to combat recreational drug use not to regulate a states medical practices
184884 we think the court should have found that californias medical marijuana laws are pre empted by the federal law
184885 we think the id card law requires us to issue cards in support of conduct that violates federal law
184886 provides yet further confirmation that states need not march in lockstep with federal policy
184887 a stinging rebuke to the misguided attempt of a few rogue counties to undermine the will of californias voters and the well being of thousands of sick and dying patients
184888 they love to take pictures by our sign and they just keep on coming maybe about 50 a day or so
184889 the sauce and the lasagna are both made completely from scratch

184893 but she is really down to earth and good natured
184894 those who got the vaccine happened to be healthier not because the flu vaccine was protecting them from pneumonia caused by the flu since it wasnt present yet
184895 so for several years now we have had large studies which question the benefit of influenza vaccination the notion that flu shots are so important thus seems more the result of repeated assertion than the weight of solid scientific evidence
184896 despite our findings and even though immune responses are known to decline with age i still want my grandmother to keep getting the flu vaccine
184897 such a taboo is irresponsible and definitely not serving the publics best interest
184898 the extension of the conservatorship was at the request and suggestion of britneys doctors
184899 theyve indicated that she has made great improvement but its a work in progress jamie spears doesnt want the conservatorship to last a day longer than the doctors recommend

184908 our plan is to conduct a transfer of authority of southern baghdad not with another coalition forces element but with the 17th iraqi army division
184909 the conditions are set for the 17th ia div to take charge of its area of operations which is virtually all of the mahmudiyah qada
184910 the mere fact that the brigade operating in this area has been directed and has had the ability to transform itself into a division speaks volumes of the capability of the iraqi army leaders and the local support of its own security forces
184911 major general ali is no doubt a leader with a nationalistic view on how to secure his area of operations he is willing to take on all that the coalition forces have and are doing to include the counter insurgency fight
184912 it is readily apparent statistically speaking that the number of attacks has reduced significantly in the past year a drawdown of more than 90 percent per week
184913 what this means to us is that the population which has always been the prize in the counterinsurgency fight has chosen peace over violence
184914 general ali knows he has defeated the enemy now he has to replace the coalition as the lead for security
184915 he will do this by establishing a permanent presence at each of the 18 patrol bases we transition thicken his lines with added ia battle positions and the maintenance of positive control of all of the 800 plus sons of iraq checkpoints across the qada
184916 he can do all this because he has established himself and his unit as a credible force that the enemy fears sheikhs respect and the government of iraq relies upon

184935 wolfgang clement hat in den vergangenen monaten gezeigt dass er mit der spd nicht mehr viel im sinn hat das ehrlichste w re dass er die konsequenzen zieht und sein parteibuch zur ckgibt

184993 for more than 20 years merck has made significant contributions to the fight against hiv and aids by discovering and developing antiretroviral medicines and creating programs to foster access in both the developed and the developing world
184994 we are pleased to continue this tradition by partnering with gilead sciences to make this important medicine available to patients who need it
184995 the acquisition of filtronics defense electronics business further expands teledynes capabilities in defense microwave subsystems
184996 this acquisition which will add expertise in receiver subsystems and digital signal processing is consistent with teledynes strategy to provide more highly integrated microwave subsystems to our defense customers
184997 the primary benefit of this agreement is that it eliminates uncertainty with respect to future losses related to this transaction we view the final outcome as favorable in light of the numerous widely circulated models that assumed a 100 write off for this transaction this settlement also confirms our view that transaction mark to market adjustments are not indicative of ultimate credit impairment
184998 this is an important milestone in our efforts to work with counterparties as we evaluate settlement as well as other restructuring opportunities related to our cdo exposures
184999 hay un di logo y una negociaci n y esperamos que en un breve plazo de tiempo se pueda producir un acuerdo entre el gobierno de venezuela y el banco santander
185000 it isnt just from here on there will be no new ones
185001 no we would never go back and ask for his bishop robinsons resignation thats not part of it
185002 the word retrospective has never been used in the consecration and election of a non celibate gay bishop its never been part of our thinking ever we may talk about them generally and it seems to affect all three general moratoria
185003 my own opinion is that the general synod of the anglican church of canada never said it refuses to rule i think due process in canada would be to allow the decision being made at general synod as it was in 2007
185004 other people would disagree and say there was nothing wrong ive always said that it is a doctrinal decision requiring the voice of general synod
185005 i dont think theres a going back i think there are ways in which we can perhaps slow down or continue to consider what a moratorium might be but i dont think its possible to go back i dont think its fair to go back
185006 it would be absolutely devastating to even think about moving back to where we were before
185007 the whole question of moratorium is a big issue because the implications of that are broad and to be quite honest the likelihood of being able to have a full and complete moratorium are in my opinion slight because of where weve come to at the present time and seeing people back up from where theyre at is going to be very difficult for some people
185008 only after a long considered period of discussion from a whole pile of points of view theological liturgical canonical and pastoral
185009 theres a certain sense that emerges from that kind of conversation and some dioceses in our country are saying that theyre discerning that theres some kind of gospel imperative to act to say to those people you have to put a moratorium its going to be a huge challenge
185010 equally a huge challenge for primates and bishops who have engaged in interventions for them to stop because theyre so convinced that theyre doing the right thing in terms of saving people who no longer have or want any association with their own church but want to remain anglican
185011 for them to say now stop it its more than obvious to me that primates have been asked to do that for the last two years and they havent in fact their interventions are increasing even as were here in this conference
185012 i dont think they actually mean cant i think they actually mean wont
185013 they have every freedom to say that im not being critical but i dont think mean they cant its not physically impossible to change that i dont think it is impossible i can understand if they say they dont want to
185014 they certainly can it may not be something they dont want to do and ill be very disappointed and ill say that out front they can say to their congregations we were wrong it will take great humility to do this but you need to go back to the anglican church of canada
185015 thats fine we do the very best we can to give a way forward given that theres not a lot of wiggle room to move in that but were doing our best if the communion doesnt accept it we will respect the decision
185016 when the groups that we have arent being listened to
185017 it will put the anglican church of canada in the position of having to support and defend irrational prejudice and bigotry in the eyes of our nation
185018 as an agreed benchmark from which it is assumed we can move forward it is not so
185019 address outstanding questions arising from the windsor report and the various formal responses from provinces and instruments of the anglican communion
185020 a huge step backwards and would have a huge effect on our diocese
185021 would have to choose between its current inclusive stance or risk diminishment of its status in the communion
185022 lord protect my family and me forgive me my sins and help me guard against pride and despair give me the wisdom to do what is right and just and make me an instrument of your will

185087 i am a tailor and i wanted to do something innovative so i made such a huge national flag i have spent my own money in making this flag and this has given me pleasure as well it has satisfied my spirit of nationalism secondly i want to dedicate this flag to the physical handicapped people on august 15 2008
185088 we are happy to be associated with this flag he is a small time tailor with a big vision and patriotism in heart as citizens of india we want to help and co operate with rasheed and thats the reason we are working with him
185089 it is now trying to mitigate the damage this move by the government reflects the reality the need to control the intelligence agencies in pakistan the need to say that the policies of pakistan are made by the civilian government and not decided anywhere in the ghq general headquarters in rawalpindi or in the isi headquarters
185090 the fact that there is a reversal sends the message that nothing can be done without the consent of the military without the consent of the isi itself and this message doesnt help gilani in one sense he gilani reinforces the perception that these forces the pakistan army and the isi act independently and that the political government is not necessarily responsible for it
185091 they the government are powerless against it and no one wants to cooperate with someone who is powerless
185092 we all know that it is going to take time to do something meaningful i think that what has been understood now is the fact that in the long term there is no real solution without the predominance of the civilians over the military the past eight years have proved that a military government is a disaster ultimately pakistan is much worse off today with all these issues and in the security situation as well
185093 its going to be frustrating its going to be exasperating at some point theyll be a lot of disillusion of mistrust i mean something needs to be done at some point but patience is part of the equation as well

185137 tuc wishes to express its concern about the sale of gt shares not only because of its implications for the potential job losses but more importantly because gt is a strategic national asset and like other state assets government should not offer gt shares for sale as if gt was created solely for financial gains without any consideration whatsoever for its social and national security implications
185138 we are aware that in the proposed deal the ghana telecom university college is to be hived off gt within 12 months of the signing of the sale purchase agreement this is a clear indication of the companys lack of commitment to social responsibility in this case the training of ghanaians to take control of the telecommunications sector it is very likely that the privatization of gt will also lead to mass lay offs
185139 government should therefore explore other options which will ensure that gt remains viable not only economically but at the same time be able to provide communication services to the people of ghana in our view this goal can be achieved only if gt remains a public asset

185214 prior to this study the gravity tractor deflection technique had been proven in only a conceptual way
185215 although there were few if any substantive criticisms of these concepts some of us had the feeling that the ideas were viewed as quaint but not ready for prime time

185223 there could be a way to feel the ether more directly theory predicts that the quantum vacuum behaves in some ways like a viscous fluid according to general relativity a gravitational field is just a distortion of the geometry of space time and it turns out that bending space puts a strain on the quantum ether if this strain changes with time you get friction leonard parker discovered in the late 1960s that an expanding or contracting universe would create particles out of a pure vacuum in effect the stretching of space jiggles up some of the virtual particles and turns them into real particles

185296 there were so many examples in the media of sexist comments where we never heard from the party leadership or barack obama
185297 the selection of either one of those instead of sen clinton i would find completely incomprehensible
185298 if anyone thinks that picking a woman will simply placate hillary clintons female supporters i think thats very patronizing to women and i dont think that that either gov sebelius or sen mccaskill would disagree

185303 i looked but couldnt find tarajis exact dress tarajis wearing this seasons staple a maxi dress with an abstract citrus hued print here are a few similar pieces
185304 citrus colors always go well with gold jewelry which taraji herself is wearing with the outfit
185305 we are hearing voices i believe those inside the rubble will be saved
185306 the majority are being caught in the shrimp trawls particularly in the gulf of mexico
185307 a lot of those sharks that are being landed are undersized
185308 thats putting a lot of pressure on those young sharks
185309 for several months weve found ourselves in the middle of a vicious national media firestorm
185310 the problem is that in the marketplace of ideas a k a the media they do not understand the bible view many of the attacks on us stem from this unfortunate fact
185311 for the moment i am happy to report to you that the storm has passed but i do emphasize for the moment
185312 but is lieberman who has repeatedly served as a top surrogate for mccains campaign speaking tomorrow for mccain who unceremoniously dumped hagee
185313 the mccain campaign didnt immediately return a call on liebermans role but liebermans senate office says this is not a surrogate event still when some time surrogates meet former surrogates in the heat of campaign season its bound to raise questions
185314 as you may know there has been an organized pretty aggressive campaign to convince me to cancel my speech this evening following the political controversy that broke out over pastor hagee and some of the comments that were attributed to him
185315 the bond that i feel with pastor hagee and each and every one of you is much stronger than that and so i am proud to stand with you tonight
185316 one of john mccains most prominent supporters on tuesday praised an evangelical leader whom the republican presidential candidate repudiated after a string of controversial remarks were made public
185317 one of sen john mccains most visible surrogates is scheduled to speak before an organization founded and led by pastor john hagee tuesday night in washington despite mccains rejection of the endorsement by the controversial pastor
185318 lieberman an orthodox jew is one of mccains highest profile supporters appearing regularly alongside mccain at events and popping up frequently as a campaign surrogate
185319 lieberman is chairman of citizens for mccain a group for independents and democrats who support mccain he is widely discussed as a possible republican national convention speaker and even as a potential running mate for the arizona republican
185320 liebermans appearance has sparked criticism particularly among some liberal advocacy groups who have urged him to sever his ties to the texas evangelical preacher lieberman supports presumed republican presidential nominee john mccain who rejected hagees endorsement in may citing the pastors claim that god sent adolf hitler to help jews reach the promised land
185321 part of what i hope to do in this campaign and as president is to get us beyond these divisions that distract us from our common challenges and our common opportunities and move the country forward
185322 tim roemer a former indiana congressman campaigning for obama in his home state which along with north carolina will hold the next round of primaries may 6 called wrights comments an unnecessary distraction
185323 i have said i do not believe sen obama shares rev wrights extreme views but let me also be clear rev hagee was not and is not my pastor or spiritual adviser and i did not attend his church for 20 years i have denounced statements he made immediately upon learning of them as i do again today
185324 outside the convention hall the address received little notice until two months ago when in the maelstrom that is presidential politics hagee became republican john mccains rev jeremiah wright
185325 but while mccain has officially renounced the pair and they him the program for the summit suggests the distancing came with a wink and a nod
185326 it touts as speakers top mccain surrogate joe lieberman and bauer a prominent mccain supporter and an informal adviser to the campaign it displayed three photos of mccain with hagee at last years summit
185327 this election may well come down to which candidate can better control his crazy pastors and after yesterdays weirdness at the convention center mccain has fallen behind by about two cubits
185328 the idea that reporters are trying to help obama win in november has grown by five percentage points
185329 when we used to talk about activity it was whether or not people decided to be active
185330 now its clear that theres an inherent drive as to whether one is active or not active
185331 surely god would provide the guidance that would lead to a better way
185332 came to despise christianity seeing it as the ideological wing of a european expansionist imperialist agenda
185333 as i learned more of the revolution i was attracted to its ideals the uprising of the oppressed the opposition to american imperialism the great satan the government of the righteous jurists and the rejection of the world order imposed on developing countries by arrogant european powers and their surrogates
185334 these campaigns will likely bring immediate military victories but long term political disasters
185335 increasingly problematic indifference towards respecting the civil liberties and other basic rights of its muslim and arab citizens
185336 will only increase the socioeconomic polarization environmental destruction and militarization that will combine to produce further instability and violence in the global system especially in the muslim world
185337 the idea of jihad as both voluntary and non expansive has existed since the earliest days of islam
185338 our claim that there is a reading of jihad that argues against perpetual warfare is not a novel one
185339 one of the loftier objectives of our religion is to introduce into the world an ethos that facilitates the spreading of peace at every level
185340 ours is a battle for hearts and minds not territory

185346 all of these superior properties translate into the highest light conversion and therefore low cost
185347 while there are other ways of making sinws our proprietary method via metal catalyzed silicon etching has many advantages
185348 it produces sinw in air over large areas as oriented arrays and at low cost from silicon wafers of any desired conductivity
185349 we also hope to design better cell structure and aim to further optimize and enhance the conversion efficiency for commercializing these cells
185350 we are especially interested in working with industry to convert our technology into a solar cell product as soon as possible
185351 we already have a counterterrorism partnership with the european union and it works indeed despite news media caricatures of aggressive americans feuding with pacifist europeans both groups are quite serious about protecting citizens by working together
185352 es que ud no entra r pido es que hay que ser vivo
185353 nearly everyone who is involved in healthcare including ems works in an environment that experiences change
185354 and with change there may be new opportunities and new challenges organizations can have a variety of responses to change and this often affects all staff from senior management to the newly hired employee
185355 currently we are not able to do glocuse tests at the basic level
185356 from a medic perspective does an initial bgl help you diagnostically in any way
185357 until you put that physics in the code you cant evaluate how the first protostars formed
185358 no simulation has ever gotten to the point of identifying this important stage in the birth of a star
185359 good reason to be skeptical of entering into campaign pledges
185360 as history evidenced you did not honor your word and broke our campaign pledge the last time around
185361 baron needs to look in the mirror both of them were responsible for the nasty campaigns they ran in 2006 baron needs to apologize as well not only to mike but to everyone in the 9th district for subjecting us to so much mud slinging and name calling like millionaire mike i commend mike for extending the olive branch maybe if they both take responsibility and apologize we can go forward and have an honorable campaign this time
185362 even though it was completely hypocritical i understand why baron wouldnt debate gas prices earlier this summer but since baron demanded a lot of debates in 2006 and since hes so good at it im sure hell have enough character and confidence to offer at least the same three debates we had then in bloomington new albany and jasper i look forward to many opportunities to debate and discuss the issues that are important to the voters of the 9th district
185363 dont just sit there and waste your precious time when you want to do something do it right away do it when you can its the only way to live a life without regrets
185364 the snavpine api is extremely easy to integrate and allowed us to effortlessly add a new personalization and social media sharing features for our customers
185365 we are very excited to share our technology and platform in an api that is as easy to use as google ad sense and lets website owners offer engaging voice and viral sharing features
185366 im looking forward to seeing the creative ways our technology will be used
185367 last friday i stood in line for a few hours to pick up an iphone 3g out in durham ive had it a week now and i figured id write up a short review comparing it to what it replaced im afraid i dont have as much to say as ben nadel so if youre looking for an in depth iphone 1 0 vs iphone 3g review id check out his review first some background for the past year and a half ive been lugging around a palm treo 6 something about the only cool thing about it was that it was red which continually made adam lehman jealous id picked it up because i was travelling a good deal more than i had been prior to its purchase and i wanted a phone thatd let me do four things

185371 its tradition for the issue after a milestone like fifty to taper off but it certainly wasnt the case here
185372 in fact the combination of invincibles new costume new sidekick and the totally kick ass cover by jim lee made this the best selling issue yet having this sell so well after we blew through issue fifty showed me the series is healthier than its ever been
185373 easy to pick up and learn but hard to master
185374 hi why are you on the ground let me lick your ankles
185375 without culture and the relative freedom it implies society even when perfect is but a jungle this is why any authentic creation is a gift to the future
185376 culture is the sum of all the forms of art of love and of thought which in the course of centuries have enabled man to be less enslaved
185377 after yesterdays match i knew there was something seriously wrong with my shoulder
185378 after taking a few different exams and mris this morning the doctors found two small tears in the tendons of my shoulder
185379 there are so many mixed feelings because last night they were almost positive there was something wrong with my nerve which could have ultimately been much more serious
185380 but after the tests this morning for the first time in a while they were able to give me a different answer and a different problem
185381 oh i will leave you a few minutes to get that figured out
185382 you may be 31 but your eggs are 32 they are formed in the womb

185385 the circumstances of the incident are currently being investigated and we are assisting the relevant authorities
185386 in poor and rural communities you can find liquor you can find tobacco but you cant always find condoms
185387 we need to do a better job educating and we need to do a better job making condoms available too
185388 there is a growing trend of hiv infected individuals knowingly infecting others with the virus
185389 this is an unspeakable act but every person must take personal responsibility for their own protection which means using a condom every time
185390 but try finding a condom in one of those stores theyre not there and its a tragedy
185391 aside from abstinence condoms are the most effective form of birth control the most effective way to prevent stds
185392 there is no excuse for not using a condom head strong condoms are easily affordable if you cant afford condoms there are places you can get them free there is no excuse
185393 please come up with something that sounds better than that
185394 im leaving because i am called to do something else
185395 say hello to the bull and dont let the door hit you on the way out
185396 i am indeed sticking my neck out right here right now
185397 declaring emphatically that i believe the market will not revisit the panicked lows it hit on july 15
185398 and i think anyone out there whos waiting for that low to be breached is in for a big disappointment and theyre missing a great deal of upside
185399 buy the next dip because i think it might be the last big one
185400 i think its just a smart call that all the evidence points toward
185401 the dream of starting a hedge fund has been an enormous pull for people coming in off the streets at the same time delivering a consistent risk adjusted return is not an easy thing to do
185402 i think the hedge funds will take over a lot of the roles of investment banking in the basic function of intermediating capital and intermediating risk in the marketplace
185403 i do think there will be more regulation and i view that as a good thing
185404 queremos que cuentes aquello que sucedi y que t sabes vendr as al plat

185406 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
185407 gas is so expensive now that even this small drop in price is enough to make it worth filling up
185408 the prices in henrietta are worth waiting for no matter how long
185409 i can use the money i save at the pump towards bills and groceries
185410 i try to combine all my shopping doctors appointments and errands into one trip to save time and money
185411 if i can do everything in henrietta i can fill up at these prices and save even more money
185412 at these prices it really doesnt matter where you go but i want to know why i have to pay 40 cents more a gallon where i live
185413 even at 3 89 a gallon im sure the oil companies are still making a huge profit someone needs to take responsibility for this
185414 one night as he lay awake thinking about god he suddenly heard the sound of a lyre playing a melody of incredible music with his spirit all intent upon god francis felt such pleasure at the wonderful melody that he thought he had left this world and the friars who were closest to him were well aware something had happened to him
185415 uh oh theyve been hacked i hope they have good backups
185416 so much worse could happen but it makes you feel like youve been invaded someone is taking liberties on your property that you would never take with anyone else

185420 weight gain is so complicated there are so many factors that can impact your weight it is more likely a combination of things more than just one factor
185421 when you dont get enough sleep your body experiences physiological stress and biochemically you store fat more efficiently
185422 add about 15 minutes to your bedtime and see how you feel
185423 continue to experiment with additional 15 minute increments until you find the amount of sleep that is right for you
185424 stress response whether it is fight or flight juggling too many responsibilities or coping with financial pressures triggers a biochemical process where our bodies go into survival mode
185425 our bodies store fuel slow down metabolism and dump out chemicals cortisol leptin and other hormones which are more likely to cause obesity in the abdominal region
185426 food is a temporary fix because it does not deal with the real stressors that must be addressed in order to reduce the trigger for eating and fix the problem
185427 many people binge on starchy foods to make themselves feel better
185428 every drug works a little differently to cause weight gain from increasing appetite altering the way fat is stored to how insulin levels change
185429 and not all drugs have the same side effects on all people
185430 rarely is the problem solved with a change in meds
185431 these things can contribute but rarely are the sole cause of the weight gain
185432 there could be very serious consequences if you stop taking your medication without consulting your physician
185433 if you are feeling fatigued lethargic swelling hoarse voice intolerance to cold sleeping too much or headaches you should see your doctor for an easy test to determine if you have hypothyroidism
185434 it is multifactoral when women go through menopause they lose estrogen causing their shapes to change usually a loss of hip and thigh weight and they start to gain more in the middle
185435 women need to understand how critically important weight lifting and strength training is to their health

185445 for a long time now ive been an environmental activist up here working hard for two basic causes to promote local and sustainable small scale selective logging practices rather than the industrial clearcuts of the past and to seek permanent wilderness designation for the last fourteen little roadless up here the last fourteen little wild gardens where we have not yet built logging roads into the furthest and farthest heart of the forest
185446 i had no inkling or imagination whatsoever that i would grow up to be hated or that my name would be reviled not just among my neighbors but by those whod never met me whod never sat down to ask about my goals or values and worst of all who did not know the creeks ridges and drainages in question
185447 in this dark low forested swampy jungle of a mountain valley the shadows of things seems as real and distinct as the things themselves so that sometimes you cant really say which is shadow and which is shadow caster

185449 to the reader who might have picked up this book hoping perhaps for lyrical descriptions of a fantastic and mythic landscape only to find a disproportinate amount of caterwauling
185450 for me wilderenss areas are a place to walk into while i am still able and to rest a place where the ever dramatic and ever increasing problems of the world are always gently and miraculously placed back in their divine and proper scale and upon my reemergence i always feel better equipped to deal with them

185473 treat others the way you would want to be treated if you were in their situation
185474 how would i wish to be treated if i were in this situation
185475 lord how do i deal with such and such whats your mind on this situation which involves so and so
185476 i would become a christian if it werent for the christians
185477 the fact is that while certain things characterize the new testament churches the new testament does not give us a complete pattern according to which churches are to be set up or formed there is no blueprint for churches in the new testament and to try to form new testament churches is only to create another system which may be as legal sectarian and dead as others churches like the church are organisms which spring out of life which life itself springs our of the cross of christ wrought into the every being of believers unless believers are crucified people there can be no true expression of the church
185478 thus having set aside all the former system of organised christianity we committed ourselves to the principle of the organic no order was setup no officers or ministries were appointed we left it with the lord to make manifest by gift and anointing who were chosen of him for oversight and ministry the one man ministry has never emerged the overseers have never been chosen by vote or selection and certainly not by the expressed desire of any leader no committees or official bodies have ever existed in any part of the work things in the main have issued from prayer

185532 it revs to 11 000 rpm and has a breaking horsepower of 145 this is a bike designed 30 years ago so very good for its time
185533 they were thinking about production then and it was so powerful that the chain stretched too much for a production bike so they tested shaft drive even though its a racing bike
185534 its pretty big out there um about two and a half hours

185539 it was like something between a dog howling and a baby crying i guess you could say
185540 i dont think it will leave me for a while
185541 i knew he was coming back from the exhibition my brother was supposed to go meet him at the bus depot and he never showed up and then my younger brother and my other brother went to go to his parents place to see if they know anything and they saw a bunch of news people there and then they asked at his parents and thats how we found out
185542 the kids will miss you so much and so will william and i you were a great person always happy and loved and had an amazing personality
185543 tim you were the best guy ever you didnt deserve this at all
185544 what you saw and what you experienced would shake the most seasoned police officer and yet im told that each of you acted swiftly calmly and bravely
185545 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
185546 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal
185547 there was no rage or anything he was like a robot stabbing the guy
185548 all of a sudden we all heard this scream this bloodcurdling scream
185549 the attacker was standing up right over top of the guy with a large hunting knife a survival rambo knife holding the guy and continually stabbing him stabbing him stabbing him in the chest area
185550 he calmly walks up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us
185551 there was no rage in him it was just like he was a robot or something
185552 believe me if we could do our jobs without having you relive this terrible experience we would
185553 i tried to get to lay down at 4 oclock this morning but was up 10 minutes later because every time i closed my eyes id see this man in the window with some guys head i had just smoked a cigarette with
185554 cannot account for human equality and does not offer reasons to believe we are all equal science measures our material and animal qualities and it finds them to be patently unequal

185576 james sebastian led the effort to introduce engineering at grand valley in the 1980s and with an experiential cooperative component only a handful of programs in the country have cooperative real world experience that is integrated and mandatory and even fewer did so when grand valleys program was founded in that sense he was a real visionary
185577 our dad was very committed to entrepreneurship to engineering and to the growth of our region
185578 he was keen on the need for engineering education to have a practical component and be grounded by the realities of manufacturing he knew that this would yield engineers who would be both creative and results oriented

185637 there are a number of pinal county sheriffs office dui cases that i will have to dismiss if i dont get the documents by this week i dont want to dismiss the cases
185638 law enforcement is charged with the responsibility of keeping these records its just standard practice if they are not keeping them or misplaced them then someone has dropped the ball

185641 shouldnt gays have the same right to screw up their lives as straight people do
185642 with oil now hovering around 125 per barrel about five times what it was five years ago and iraqs oil production at record levels sigir estimates that oil revenues for 2008 could exceed 70 billion
185643 they certainly have the resources to invest in their infrastructure program
185644 i think we ought to just take them at their word on that and focus on helping iraq carry out its own program funded by its own money
185645 a lot of that money is going to be left unspent
185646 given that was going on earlier this year and that we have this massive windfall occurring inevitably there has to be concerns about corruption with regards to those funds
185647 it will be an almost 50 percent municipal tax increase
185648 its going to be devastating to our community to pick up these costs
185649 everybody is trying to think of what we can cut out to free up the money if you need money for a road program you can bond for it you cant bond for this
185650 the state receives hundreds of thousands of dollars from the money paid on tickets and violations that occur in our town so its not like weve been accepting services for free
185651 the budget is already passed there is no way for us to insert a line item were probably going to have to make emergency funding for it if indeed it goes through that we have to pay for it
185652 in eagleswood weve already thinned things down we cut right down to the quill here
185653 one of the reasons these things were set up was so that people could plan ahead and also maybe take alternative routes
185654 maybe they dont need to go that route they want to go another
185655 essentially they sent these letters out even though we were supposed to have the opportunity to meet with state officials
185656 its kind of like putting the cart before the horse it would have been nice to have had a discussion about these patrols before they came up with a cost sharing formula
185657 the reason im so aggravated is our whole vision and focus is to supposedly minimize property taxes and this isnt accomplishing that
185658 the residents of millstone township will suffer especially now while were in such a poor economy we have a number of home foreclosures just as other municipalities do this will probably push more people toward foreclosure
185659 there are other people that are already paying for their law enforcement and public safety
185660 im pledged to make sure we work through these issues so that were sensitive to needs but these charges have to be paid for and somebodys getting the benefit of those charges
185661 we think the way weve gone about this is more than fair
185662 in retrospect although my concern for biosafety was honest and my desire to refrain from crying wolf was sincere i should have notified my supervisor ahead of time of my worries about a possible breach in biocontainment
185663 i thought that quietly and diligently cleaning the dirty desk area would both eliminate any possible anthrax contamination as well as prevent unintended anxiety at the institute
185664 i honestly do not recall if follow up swabs were taken of the area
185665 i may have done so but i do not now remember reswabbing
185666 although it is admitted that these police officers actions were clearly outside the scope of their employment as police officers there are allegations that the lack of procedures and supervision of the officers allowed such conduct to have taken place
185667 we couldnt buy it directly from a big insurance company we had to go through a broker because were self employed
185668 at every one of them the main issue was health care costs
185669 over 80 percent of small business owners say health care is not affordable to them and most want some sort of government intervention at the municipal state or federal level
185670 many small businesses that are not insured owners as well as employees prefer to go without insurance than to even try to pay for it
185671 many owners are not members of any organization and because of that theyre not benefiting from the collaboration and the buy that organizations make with health care organizations to bring down the cost to them
185672 if youre a larger business you have more negotiating power with insurance companies
185673 one of the challenges small businesses have is balancing the cost and the coverage of insurance
185674 its fairly easy to get insurance if you take a massively high deductible the thing small businesses need most is more choices and better prices health insurance is a great retention program and ensures youve got a healthy workforce thats going to arrive at work every day
185675 despite clear increases in health insurance costs and cost burden there is no evidence that firms dropped coverage over the period analyzed health insurance offer rates remained relatively stable from 2000 to 2005
185676 these findings suggest that firms and ultimately their employees were willing to shoulder the burden of rising health insurance costs even if it meant giving up increases in wages

185682 i think in football there is too much modern slavery transferring players or buying players here and there and putting them somewhere
185683 we are trying now to intervene in such cases if the player wants to play somewhere else then a solution should be found
185684 what i said is slavery is with the young people youngsters that european clubs are trying to get and bring them to the big clubs this is my expression this is modern slavery
185685 in saints row 1 we got about half way through the process and then we realized that we just could not get our heads around cell it is just really complicated and im sure you noticed other games like stranglehold push their dates up cells really really powerful the problem is it is also a really different system the way it uses multi threading technology

185913 in my opinion they batterers are not cold but more likely seething with distressing emotions and out of control
185914 newer studies are beginning to show that batterers may have suffered psychological abuse as well and consequently feel insecure
185915 as adults they become emotionally dependent upon a wife and expect her to be responsible for making them happy

185925 they need to think beforehand whether its worth jail time court costs and a fine to hit their wife because the tv was too loud
185926 we are teaching them how to live totally violent free lives
185927 not just at home this carries over into the work place and disagreements with the boss or a neighbor
185928 it is not uncommon for a batterer to truly believe that he had not other choice time out is a useful adjunct to almost any treatment plan the batterer learns to stop even the first blow
185929 right now we are on the cutting edge of that most of the men in our program are still from the old school dad was the boss but as more people are educated and society provides new role models to follow we will see a change

186021 gary millers kennedy vs the machine was one of the most important things to happen in the blogosphere in the last two years

186023 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever
186024 gary miller who started kvm and is as good a blogger as exists has not wavered in his criticism of zogbys methodology
186025 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
186026 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
186027 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
186028 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
186029 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
186030 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant
186031 gary thanks for choosing me and inviting other rational conservatives to do the same

186042 i didnt realize that that stadium held 150 000 people when i played in that miami game because thats about how many people ive run into who said they were sitting in the corner of the end zone when i knocked that ball down
186043 when i was in the nfl i was reminded about that play by a lot by other players and i was always more upset that they didnt talk about my interception return for a touchdown in that game
186044 sometimes ill think wow if i didnt make that play it might be difficult to come back to notre dame

186084 the tactic could cut both ways it might tap into the qualms some white working class voters in crucial swing states may have about a black candidate or it could ricochet back against the mccain campaign which has been accused even by some fellow republicans of engaging in overly negative campaigning in recent days
186085 we have waited for months with a sick feeling knowing this moment would come because we watched it incur with president clinton say whatever you want about president clinton his record on this issue is above reproach
186086 the mccain campaign has obviously been watching our primary very closely and recognized how damaging it had been to be tagged with the charge of race baiting
186087 what they did to mccain in 2000 is what mccains trying to do to barack obama in 2008
186088 the exchange was reminiscent of several flare ups over race during the democratic primaries when the obama campaign complained about comments made by bill clinton in support of the candidacy of his wife

186119 mrs joness insurer will only cover ventolin hfa or proair hfa but youve written proventil hfa can we switch
186120 rapid heart beat vomiting chest pain and palpitation occurs more frequently with proventil hfa than with cfc albuterol
186121 so despite the damage the freon in the generic inhalers do to the ozone layer 74 million inhalers last year
186122 sep 18 2007 mediterranean diet halves risk of progressive lung disease a large
186123 there is no freon in cfc mdis freon is cfc 113 it is not used in inhalers cfc 11 12 are used in mdis
186124 i recently requested and had a conversation with the inventor of the hfa 134a propellant and also proventil hfa and he told me straight up that he likes proventil hfa better due to some of the valving issues however he feels that schering plough is raping the population by selling this 10 year old drug at the highest retail price of any albuterol on the market
186125 rapid heart beat vomiting chest pain and palpitation occurs more frequently with proventil hfa than with cfc albuterol
186126 such as the hfa inhalers many pulmonary patients are now suffering with and in some cases undoubtedly dying from and b as fda whistleblower dr
186127 the classic approach of industry and fda has been to do studies that are too small to conclusively identify that a risk is real
186128 there is nothing worse or more unethical than someone who cannot discuss the disease state trying to prove a medical point through anecdotal evidence
186129 the gas hfa 134a has over 25 years in human testing with thousands of patients across the world
186130 my debate with arthur has to do with his lack of knowledge of the history of hfa as well as the vast majority of people who use it daily and never have an issue vs his message of doom and gloom and you are all going to die yes an exageration of his point but none the less if you use hfa which is just a false statement
186131 additionally he would rather patients be afraid of their rescue medicine and not take it but sign up for his petition even though it is a decided issue already and he has to have the knowledge that the change has already occured in regards to these inhalers
186132 so the change is coming doctors have no say in it blame president clinton for ratifying the montreol protocol treaty in 96 that is what is forcing the change over and more expensive drugs

186150 the delivery of justice is an objective process and its difficult sometimes for those who are caught up in this sort of process to understand all the ramifications of how it works
186151 one can feel sorry for that but its more important that justice should be done weve been delivering justice in this island for centuries and i dont see how this makes any difference
186152 it is difficult for people outside to understand that in a small place you are particularly aware of the need to behave properly behave appropriately to have the integrity to take decisions which need to be taken
186153 i have had to consider the position of politicians and ministers and i have done that
186154 prevailing desire to sweep scandal and abuse under the carpet
186155 what has made this significantly different from many similar inquiries ive been involved with is the political hostility it has engendered
186156 politicians one would normally think should be crawling over themselves to offer support to the inquiry and the victims with a few notable exceptions that hasnt happened here the only intervention most of them seem to have made is to criticize the investigation

186168 there was a dozen ideas proffered about how to trigger a war
186169 the one that interested me the most was why dont we build we in our shipyard build four or five boats that look like iranian pt boats put navy seals on them with a lot of arms and next time one of our boats goes to the straits of hormuz start a shoot up
186170 in order to provoke an attack which could then be used to justify material breach
186171 the most extraordinary exchange takes place when lt gen michael delong bemoans shrinking political support for neo con war plans on capitol hill and suggests that sympathy for the bush administrations agenda will only be achieved after a new terror attack
186172 rumsfeld agrees that the psychological impact of 9 11 is wearing off and the behavior pattern of citizens in both the u s and europe suggests that they are unconcerned about the threat of terror
186173 so i can understand the argument for not writing something that was rejected uh maybe my attitude always towards editors is theyre mice training to be rats but the point is jejune if you know what that means

186441 violence is down to levels not seen since the spring of 2004 and the improvements are becoming consistent
186442 made good on an earlier promise confirming that starting tomorrow combat tours for troops heading to iraq and afghanistan will now be reduced from 15 months back to 12
186443 falling violence levels in iraq should allow troop withdrawals there to continue
186444 progress in iraq while potentially reversible has a degree of durability
186445 appeared to lay the groundwork for an announcement in coming weeks of further us troop reductions

186453 said that the aides could cite executive privilege and refuse to answer specific questions once they were in front of congress
186454 the ruling by us district judge john d bates doesnt settle the larger question of whether

186463 took another shot today at enticing cajoling or shaming democratic lawmakers into doing something about the energy crunch once again there was much more talk than action on capitol hill and the stumbling block continues to be the republican call for new domestic oil drilling
186464 insisted his administration has been pushing a variety of new energy plans including clean coal technology and will continue to do so for the third straight day he said when it comes to oil and natural gas congress wont allow votes on practical solutions like domestic drilling
186465 as congress begins a five week break without passing legislation to address high gasoline prices democrats and republicans are fighting for the political high ground in the energy debate

186471 well the campaigns starting to get nasty have you seen the new commercial the mccain campaign compares barack obama to britney spears and paris hilton and today the obama campaign released an ad comparing john mccain to zsa zsa gabor and bea arthur
186472 obamas people are trying to portray mccain as cranky and mccain is trying to portray obama as arrogant you see
186473 and when mccain was asked about being labeled cranky he told the reporter to go to hell
186474 in a speech yesterday barack obama said hes distantly related to the famous 19th century gunslinger wild bill hickock after hearing this john mccain said big deal i went to high school with him
186475 president bush is on the hunt for a new home i guess his master plan of massive foreclosures and plummeting real estate prices has finally paid off because he should get a good deal

186478 denuclearization of the dprk a role for the united nations
186479 the denuclearization of the democratic peoples republic of korea dprk continues to be a source of considerable international concern yet no coherent international framework has emerged to deal with this challenge in parallel with the regional mechanism of the six party talks with the nuclear non proliferation treaty npt review conference set for 2010 appropriately addressing the dprk nuclear issue is being identified as essential to maintaining the strength of the npt can the united nations un afford to take a back seat in attempts at resolution this article examines the potential of and prospects for an active un role in facilitating pyongyangs denuclearization process
186480 evolution of the un role in the denuclearization of the dprk the dprk nuclear issue is neither a single nation problem nor solely the responsibility of regional powers the un through its historical role on the korean peninsula has played a part in the larger picture the korean war the first of a handful of times un members have collectively intervened in a war for the sake of restoring peace the korean war 1950 53 posed one of the most severe tests the un has faced since its founding in 1945 when war broke out in 1950 the soviet union was protesting by means of a boycott the security councils denial of the chinese seat to the government of mainland china unrestrained by the veto of the absent ussr the remaining council members resolved to send un forces to korea under u s command nearly 90 percent of all army personnel 93 percent of all air power and 86 percent of all naval power under the force commander an american general douglas macarthur was provided by the united states chinese involvement resulted in the un force being pushed back and an armistice signed at panmunjom in 1953 the subsequent resignation of un secretary general trygve lie was widely attributed to the ussrs displeasure at un involvement in the crisis today although the troops deployed south of the demilitarized zone under u s command continue to operate under the uns blue flag that international body exercises no control over them it is alleged that the dprk took recourse to developing its nuclear capability at least in part as a consequence of being made to feel insecure by the u s military presence and its de facto nuclear protection of both south korea and japan

186543 then that will make it easier for arab states and the gulf states to support us when it comes to issues like iraq and afghanistan
186544 it also will weaken iran which has been using hamas and hezbollah as a way to stir up mischief in the region if weve gotten an israeli palestinian peace deal maybe at the same time peeling syria out of the iranian orbit that makes it easier to isolate iran so that they have a tougher time developing a nuclear weapon

186697 how to promote your band using new media outlets and techniques
186698 sderot residents feel that there are two battles taking place in their city the first is with the hamas rockets and the second is with the israel tax authority
186699 they make us feel like we are just looking to get some cash its humiliating they dont address the rocket situation or understand the situation we are in
186700 after our home was partially destroyed in the rocket attack we moved to a motel room in ashkelon until the motel would no longer house my family for free
186701 we then moved back to sderot into a tiny three room apartment near our destroyed home so that i would be able to overlook the eventual reconstruction of our house during this time my wife aliza and i engaged in a long legal battle with the israel tax authority until they finally agreed to pay approximately 300 000 nis to rebuild our home out of the estimated 500 000 nis
186702 one major problem is that the average sderot resident has absolutely no idea what his or her rights are living under a rocket war zone
186703 i spend 700 nis a month for my medication just to keep functioning during the day
186704 when the israel tax authority came to assess the damages they concluded that only the ceramic tiles in my kitchen were damaged even though my marble tiles were damaged as well
186705 the total costs of damage done to my friends business reached 100 000 nis
186706 all you have to do is wash the clothing and then you can sell them the israel tax authority representative told her
186707 what they didnt consider was that the value of clothing had been rendered worthless at the time they were damaged
186708 from what we understand from sderot resident whose homes have been hit in the past israeli tax authority representatives come into a home or a business that was damaged by a rocket without having any photos of evidence of the property before it was damaged and assign the estimated value of the damages which many times does not properly necessarily reflect the true value of the object or property that was damaged in the eyes of the resident
186709 hes a digital native youre a digital immigrant your brains are never going to be on the same circuit system
186710 the worrying view coming through is that students are lacking in reflective awareness
186711 technology makes it easy for them to collate information but not to analyse and understand it much of the evidence suggests that what is going on out there is quite superficial
186712 the same has happened to professors and lecturers everyone exhibits a bouncing flicking behaviour which sees them searching horizontally rather than vertically power browsing is the norm
186713 when i was doing my physics a level i had one standard textbook in which everything was gospel your son can go online find information that challenges the text and then he can network with others compare notes and even e mail the experts
186714 education has always been about absorbing the facts first and reflecting on them second technology is not hampering that but take away his laptop and you are just setting him up for a rebellion
186715 i shouldnt worry about him being on facebook all he is doing is using technology to replace the friend who might have come to do his homework with him
186716 the downside is that they expect more variety so their boredom threshold is falling some teaching is adapting to that and becoming more dynamic some is not
186717 but like all of us they wont do something until they have to unless they are passionate about it
186718 because they have been using digital technology all their lives our children feel they have authority over it
186719 but technology cannot teach them to reflect upon and evaluate the information they are gathering online for that the role of teachers and parents remains fundamentally important you are in the hot seat they still need you to open that conversation

186724 it was in these circumstances that jesus came to set up on earth a spiritual kingdom which by separating the theological from the political system made the state no longer one and brought about the internal divisions which have never ceased to trouble christian peoples
186725 what the pagans had feared took place then everything changed its aspect the humble christians changed their language and soon this so called kingdom of the other world turned under a visible leader into the most violent of earthly despotisms
186726 several peoples however even in europe and its neighborhood have desired without success to preserve or restore the old system but the spirit of christianity has everywhere prevailed the sacred cult has always remained or again become independent of the sovereign and there has been no necessary link between it and the body of the state mahomet held very sane views and linked his political system well together and as long as the form of his government continued under the caliphs who succeeded him that government was indeed one and so far good

186801 this is a weaker performance for obama than in june but a better performance for him than in any month but june our model weights those two factors and concludes that the status quo has more or less been preserved
186802 what the mccain campaign doesnt want people to know according to one gop strategist i spoke with over the weekend is that they had an ad script ready to go if obama had visited the wounded troops saying that obama was wait for it using wounded troops as campaign props so no matter which way obama turned mccain had an obama bashing ad ready to launch i guess thats political hardball but another word for it is the one word that most politicians are loathe to use about their opponents a lie
186803 who better to counterprogram obama than someone whos like obama in many ways except with accomplishments
186804 since 1968 most terrorist groups ended operations because they joined the political process 43 percent or local police and intelligence agencies arrested or killed key members 40 percent
186805 fate decides and this is what it had in store for us we got one of the most difficult clubs in one respect it is a tough draw but in the other we know the opponents very well arsenal will be no strangers to us
186806 the players are very enthusiastic and i think this is a reward for the progress they have made
186807 it will be very tough for us but it is very exciting twente would be the underdog against any opponent in this competition but against arsenal that is an understatement
186808 we will monitor them to prepare for the matches in the first leg well have to get into a good position for the return
186809 they are the best team we could have come up against in this round
186810 however i am sure atl tico would have preferred another opponent this is the kind of fixture you would see in the last 16 or the quarter finals
186811 all of the teams are difficult and when there is a draw like this you have to face the rival that fate hands you
186812 weve been given a very strong german team but in any case we are going to give it our all most people say that its better to play the second leg at home
186813 we are a team that is growing and working we have signed good players and have been working for the past two years to reach the very top level were going to check if manuel neuer is going to be fit as hes a great goalkeeper and that could make a difference they have two or three important croatian players i think that ivan rakiti is also injured rafinha is in beijing like sergio kun ag ero they have signed jefferson farf n who is a great attacker while they also have halil alt ntop theyre a tough team but so are we

186855 johnny always wanted to bring purpose to other peoples lives he had a quiet leadership that lives in all of us as a band his legacy is in his music and every show we play we are sharing a piece of johnnys heart with our listeners not only would he want us to carry on but we owe it to him
186856 we have had to do some major soul searching as a band we not only have lost a band member but our best friend the process is just beginning we will never be able to replace johnny but through this tragedy we have all grown even closer together and are going to make him proud
186857 following a period of mourning over the loss of a great friend it was only natural to want to move on for two weeks we were wrapped up in what seemed to be an enormous setback for our band now its proven to be more of an opportunity to unite and see something through till the end
186858 joey has been a long time band friend his old band the brotherhood of dae han and tickle me pink have grown up playing shows together through this we have all made a special bond especially with joey he appears on our nationally released live dvd on a few songs and was in the studio with us during some of the recordings joey is not only a brilliant player he is a great friend to us and was to johnny johnny would want it this way if he could somehow have a say
186859 joey has been a great friend of ours and johnnys since the very beginning in addition to being an amazing musician with reputable songwriting ability he is also one of the nicest guys i know
186860 it is somewhat ironic that many of our songs deal with death and a higher purpose we dont think it is a coincidence that these songs came about on our record we want to let the world know how short life is embrace the ones you love and treasure each moment without regret
186861 i have lots of inward battles i was raised in a very religious home i constantly struggle with my conscience a higher purpose contentment and the curse of always wanting more
186862 i have to make music it makes me whole and it is a part of my blood and soul
186863 this is a darker song about the devil within us all its goal is to portray how selfish our flesh is there might be a raging battle in our heads but we are too prideful to not hurt someone else someone else who is unhappy brings comfort so what would make you feel better hurting the person so they are miserable alongside you or being alone for the night the entire song is an internal struggle
186864 madeline represents my friends who have gone off of the deep end it illustrates how sorry i feel that my impact on some of my friends has not been more positive every activity shared in the song may have been fun at the time but ultimately brought madeline to her death living with the thought that you might have been the final straw is a tough mental battle

186950 i love making the hard decisions whether it be about money or people or both of course

186955 oh fuck no the kissing makes me feel guilty the sex is just a means to an end

186958 how would you talk to someone whom you knew was going to kill you in say a year what would you ask them

186977 ah not just tv but tv election news coverage you see son youre suffering from election fatigue syndrome
186978 its going around we start to see a few cases as much as two years before a presidential election but by the time the election rolls around its nearly epidemic the symptoms include as you described general fatigue and stress which is brought on by too much election coverage and analysis
186979 well you also have a touch of both john mccain pneumonia and the barack obama flu the symptoms are nausea and the inability to stomach any more malarkey juvenile name calling or empty promises
186980 oh its bad all right but its not fatal to humans although it has been known to be fatal to tv sets were seeing a lot of shoes and remote controls embedded in tv screens right now

186994 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me

186999 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
187000 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
187001 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

187065 the travesty of durban ii as a vehicle for getting serious about combating racism is more obvious than ever as a regime whose president is a holocaust denier acquires an important role in shaping the result

187091 was kind of dazing in and out of a semiconscious state
187092 s he wasnt sure where she was or what had happened
187093 in order to prove an assault each of the following elements must be proved 1 a person willfully committed an act which by its nature would probably and directly result in the application of physical force on another person 2 the person committing the act was aware of facts that would lead a reasonable person to realize that as a direct natural and probable result of this act that sic physical force would be applied to another person and 3 at the time the act was committed the person committing the act had the present ability to apply physical force to the person of another
187094 regarding element 2 it states was the person aware etc is there a temporal portion to this count
187095 1 there is no awareness element 2 there is no temporal element
187096 c oncerning the mental state for assault the california supreme court has long held that to establish the crime of assault the prosecution need not prove the defendant specifically intended to cause injury
187097 aware of facts that would lead a reasonable person to realize that as a direct natural and probable result of this act that sic physical force would be applied to another person
187098 h ere the trial court initially gave an instruction on the elements of assault which included as element 2 the awareness language approved in williams however asked to clarify that portion of the instruction the court instead told the jury there is no awareness element this permitted the jury to find defendant guilty of assault without considering whether she was aware of facts that would lead a reasonable person to realize that physical force would be applied to martinez this represented clear error under the supreme courts holding in williams
187099 what the fucking hell i get a call from my doctors office asking if i can come laughingly i told the gal who called no because i am busy like that luckily its a friend of mine and she was able to give me the awesome news that i was pregnant
187100 ive been retired six years and have had teams call me
187101 ill be like another set of eyes for gm dale tallon and coach denis savard and the organization and hopefully do what i did with detroit im going to be able to watch as many games as i want to i love going to games and this is going to be an exciting place to go to games
187102 even if you think youre going to do something and scotty said i like it youd feel better about making the move with his experience and knowledge
187103 hes going to be a tremendous help to dale he really was the guy who taught our players and demanded our players take it to another level im going to miss him professionally and personally he has passion energy and hes fun to be around
187104 when he said hes going to be an extra set of eyes i said those are the best eyes a person can have were going to rely on him in every aspect his knowledge of coaching of drafting and of trading adding scotty in the mix gives us a better opportunity to be successful in any moves we make
187105 i have very fond memories of when i was my sons age of just sitting around and listening to my dad talk to other coaches talk about hockey
187106 my favorite thing to was just kind of be a fly on the wall and listen to him talk strategy
187107 dudley guys at every turn and preparing for his own shot at the job
187108 hes battled quite a bit the last year and a half with the recurrence of hodgkins and hes doing pretty well right now and this might give him a boost as well
187109 and the fact they have done a lot of exciting things on and off the ice interests me you have to play on the ice but i think they are really on their way
187110 i got to know gordie pretty well in the last 15 years and he told me he had a lot of highlights in his career but if he had to pick one highlight it would have been playing with mark and marty
187111 im not a player but its a similar situation because i get to work with family
187112 im disappointed hes going for me personally for us professionally
187113 but when there were rumors about him going to toronto a year ago i said this entire organization is indebted to scotty for what he did from 1994 to 2002 and we have to support him in whatever decision he wants to make id like to think professionally we offered him everything that he wanted but i know he has his son involved in the chicago blackhawks if you ever get a chance to work with your family thats special
187114 i really believe hes going to chicago for personal reasons
187115 id like to think professionally we offered him everything that he wanted but i know he has his son involved in the chicago blackhawks if you ever get a chance to work with your family thats special
187116 he really allowed us to go from being a talented team in the mid 90s to a championship team
187117 he came in and he drove our players he made some moves as the director of player personnel to bring in slava fetisov who is ever going to forget that who is ever going to forget him putting together the russian five or scotty really willing steve yzerman to become in my opinion the best two way player in the game and obviously the championships
187118 one of the reasons ive become a manager in the national hockey league was because of the winning we did
187119 the opportunity to work with scotty every day for six years is something ill never forget
187120 i know scotty loved being a red wing but i just think in the end the opportunity to be with his son was something he couldnt pass up
187121 he was pretty emotional when he called me about it im gonna miss him professionally and personally i loved being around him being a young general manager and getting to work with scotty bowman for me it was like going to harvard
187122 i dont know of another franchise in sports thats had a better 12 months than this one
187123 to a man they said theres no better feeling than getting to work with your son said bowman who signed a three year contract
187124 its always a concern when youre thinking of leaving some place youve been for a long time the positive reaction i got was very appreciated theres no animosity like i was sneaking out the back door even though chicago is a big rival

187157 im grateful that you are so outspoken in talking to the church we need to really hear and respond to the tragedy of sexual abuse by the clergy as a former roman catholic priest and now a priest of the episcopal church im shocked at my own hardness of heart and the slow awareness of the tragedy of abuse let alone by the clergy its a kind of spiritual murder thanks for your clear understanding and peace in christ

187187 the laughable mediocre toads contributing to the standard delude themselves that they are left wing progressive bloggers they are nothing of the sort they are company hacks shills for the ruling party and a particularly contemptible medium for a conspicuously craven brand of propaganda
187188 what people come to religion for is an ultimate metaphysical hunger and when that hunger is not satisfied religion declines
187189 religion represents the accumulation of mans insight over thousands of years into such questions as the nature of man the meaning of life the individuals place in the universe that is precisely the question at the root of mans restlessness
187190 man seeks something to end his state of confusion and emptiness in the latest parlance an antidote for aimlessness
187191 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life
187192 for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved
187193 a well of living water springing up into everlasting life
187194 and i know that ye do walk in the pride of your hearts and there are none save a few only who do not lift themselves up in the pride of their hearts unto envying and strifes and malice and persecutions and all manner of iniquities because of the pride of your hearts
187195 behold ye do love money and your substance and your fine apparel and the adorning of your churches more than ye love the poor and the needy the sick and the afflicted

187198 traitors heady highminded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god
187199 having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof
187200 as accepting the scriptures only as sources of inspiration and moral truth
187201 do the revelations of god give us a handrail to the kingdom of god as the lords messenger told lehi or merely a compass
187202 a liberal in the church is merely one who does not have a testimony
187203 it is folly to speak of a liberal religion if that religion claims that it rests upon unchanging truth
187204 it is well to beware of people who go about proclaiming that they are or their churches are liberal the probabilities are that the structure of their faith is built on sand and will not withstand the storms of truth
187205 i accept all i read in the bible that i can understand and accept the rest on faith
187206 why didnt the lord tell us plainly about these things
187207 it is likely we would not understand if he did it might be like trying to explain the theory of atomic energy to an eight year old child
187208 except ye be converted and become as little children ye shall not enter into the kingdom of god
187209 into my heart purified of all sin there entered a light which came from on high and then suddenly and in a marvelous manner i saw certainty succeed doubt
187210 but whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me it were better that a millstone were hanged about his neck and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea
187211 but take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak
187212 and through thy knowledge shall the weak perish for whom christ died
187213 but when ye sin so against the brethren and wound their weak conscience ye sin against christ
187214 when they are learned they think they are wise and they hearken not unto the counsel of god for they set it aside supposing they know of themselves wherefore their wisdom is foolishness and it profiteth them not
187215 but to be learned is good if they hearken to the counsels of god
187216 i have spent the last twenty years of my life at mount vernon reducing my ignorance
187217 washington never went to school thats why he was an educated man he never quit learning
187218 i have spent more than three score years of my life reducing my ignorance
187219 we can become educated persons regardless of our stations in life if we never quit learning
187220 any man who does his work well who is justifiably self confident and not unduly disturbed by the jeers of the cynics and the shirkers any man who stays true to decent motives and is considerate of others is in essence a leader
187221 and that by the way is what the good lord put us on this earth for
187222 not merely as to whether baptism should be by immersion or for the forgiveness of sins but the rubbish of accumulated ages was swept aside the rocks made bare and the foundations of the kingdom of god were relaid
187223 teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom in all things that pertain to the kingdom of god
187224 the resurrection and the life and he that believeth in him though he were dead yet shall he live
187225 and whosoever liveth and believeth in him shall never die
187226 thou art the christ the son of the living god
187227 yea lord i believe thou art the christ the son of god which should come into the world

187257 markets tend to react conservatively when faced with such tightening policies from the central bank so it is not entirely surprising to find the interest rate structure of the banking system going through a dynamic review and adjusting to the evolving market realities
187258 it is too early to comment on a rate hike but the pressure seems inevitable we will have to analyse this soon before taking any decision
187259 the cost of borrowing goes up not only for builders but for all ancillary and input industries as well leading to a higher price tag for the real estate product
187260 developers will now have to look towards other sources of funds which could be on higher rates

187279 all human beings are of the nature to get sick to get old and to die
187280 when i lived in monasteries in thailand the meditation halls always had human skeletons hanging in them
187281 the skeletons hung there for everyone to reflect on and they had little handwritten signs that read once i was like you
187282 when you are a monk in thailand its almost inevitable that you will get malaria
187283 so when you finally get it you dont see it as something abnormal but rather as a normal human experience and an opportunity for spiritual practice
187284 if i saw a photograph of a buddhist monk something went off inside of me
187285 it struck me hard like a gong it hit the depth of my heart
187286 even if there is sincerity there may not be the wisdom to know what is helpful and what is destructive
187287 increasingly i began to think that at least i can clean up this little corner of the environment
187288 i could clean up my own mind and my own behavior
187289 although im traveling lightly im still carrying too much baggage
187290 often i feel in the awkward position of being half monk half adventurer i no longer take things like worldly achievement social expectations and money seriously but im still living a secular life im beginning to think like a monk yet i continue to follow old habits
187291 an insect appeared circled the flame and dove in to its death it occurred to me that i am not much smarter attracted by bright lights how many times have i jumped into the fire and been burned
187292 i could have gone off to the amazon and become an ecoterrorist blowing up bulldozers that were ruining the rainforest
187293 but i knew that would potentially harm other people and it wouldnt come from a peaceful mind
187294 ripples start to go out in unseen ways immediately the idea of meditation as a selfish thing doesnt make sense it has immediate effects
187295 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery

187305 there have been incidents both in pubs and other establishments when it has not been possible to identify offenders captured on cctv because hats were hiding their faces
187306 theyve got test ranges in iran which are more than long enough to handle scud launches and even shahab 3 launches
187307 why would they be launching from the surface of the caspian sea they obviously have not explained that to us
187308 detonated the warhead near apogee not over the target area where the thing would eventually land but at altitude
187309 the only plausible explanation we can find is that the iranians are figuring out how to launch a missile from a ship and get it up to altitude and then detonate it
187310 and thats exactly what you would do if you had a nuclear weapon on a scud or a shahab 3 or other missile and you wanted to explode it over the united states
187311 if even a crude nuclear weapon were detonated anywhere between 40 kilometers to 400 kilometers above the earth in a split second it would generate an electro magnetic pulse emp that would cripple military and civilian communications power transportation water food and other infrastructure
187312 the first indication of such an attack would be that the power would go out and some but not all the telecommunications would go out we would not physically feel anything in our bodies
187313 so you would be walking you wouldnt be driving at that point
187314 and it wouldnt do any good to call the maintenance or repair people because they wouldnt be able to get there even if you could get through to them
187315 we wouldnt be able to pump the fuel into the trucks and get the trucks to the warehouses
187316 would quickly revert to an early 19th century type of country
187317 most of the things we depend upon would be gone and we would literally be depending on our own assets and those we could reach by walking to them
187318 people in hospitals would be dying faster than that because they depend on power to stay alive but then it would go to water food civil authority emergency services and we would end up with a country with many many people not surviving the event
187319 you have to go back into the 1800s to look at the size of population
187320 id have to say that 70 to 90 percent of the population would not be sustainable after this kind of attack
187321 explicitly discuss a nuclear emp attack that would gravely harm the united states
187322 one of the nations in the middle east had launched a ballistic missile from a cargo vessel they had taken a short range probably scud missile put it on a transporter erector launcher lowered it in taken the vessel out into the water peeled back the top erected it fired it lowered it and covered it up and the ship that they used was using a radar and electronic equipment that was no different than 50 60 100 other ships operating in the immediate area
187323 well known to the white house but have not been disseminated to the appropriate congressional committees
187324 could be used in a devastating stealth attack against the united states or israel for which the united states has no known or planned defense
187325 the use of an atomic bomb against israel would destroy israel completely while the same against the islamic only would cause damages such a scenario is not inconceivable
187326 an emp attack on america would send us back to the horse and buggy era without the horse and buggy
187327 if youre a terrorist this is your ultimate goal your ultimate asymmetric weapon
187328 they could do it either directly or anonymously by putting some freighter out there on the ocean
187329 its well known that people dont go on a diet until theyve had a heart attack
187330 and we as a nation are having a heart attack
187331 as of today we have no defense against such an attack we need space based missile defenses to protect against an emp attack
187332 nuclear missiles dont discriminate on party lines when they land
187333 senator obama has been quoted as saying i dont agree with a missile defense system and that we can cut 10 billion of the research out never mind as i say that the entire budget is 9 6 billion or 9 3 billion
187334 needs a missile defense that is so strong in all the different phases we need to defend against that countries will decide its not worth coming up against us
187335 thats one of the things that defeated the soviet union
187336 re 7 29 08 propaganda 70 of us would die from em pulse attack by iran
187337 if even a crude nuclear weapon were detonated anywhere between 40 kilometers to 400 kilometers above the earth in a split second it would generate an electro magnetic pulse emp that would cripple military and civilian communications power transportation water food and other infrastructure
187338 u s intel iran plans nuclear strike on u s
187339 iran has carried out missile tests for what could be a plan for a nuclear strike on the united states the head of a national security panel has warned in testimony before the house armed services committee and in remarks to a private conference on missile defense over the weekend hosted by the claremont institute dr william graham warned that the u s intelligence community doesnt have a story to explain the recent iranian tests graham chairs the commission to assess the threat to the united states from electromagnetic pulse emp attack a blue ribbon panel established by congress in 2001

187342 what you have to do is say how are we going to manage it
187343 think outside the bottle to promote protect and ensure public funding for public water systems by getting people to choose tap water over bottled water supporters include actor martin sheen
187344 im a big believer in bottled water said don robart mayor of cuyahoga falls ohio who did not support the resolution against bottled water at the mayors meeting in june from a health standpoint alone i think we should be encouraging it
187345 we would lose access to one of the best resources we have
187346 those conspiracies that are too incredible to be believed are
187347 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
187348 those conspiracies that are too incredible to be believed are
187349 these days we dont think its bad or lucky its just natural
187350 eclipses were reported where none took place in areas of political or bureaucratic strife

187352 the meeting leader said i am not telling you how to vote but if the democrats win this bill will pass and you wont have a vote on whether you want a union
187353 i am not a stupid person they were telling me how to vote
187354 if anyone representing wal mart gave the impression we were telling associates how to vot on record as opposing it for some time
187355 we feel educating our associates about the bill is the right thing to do
187356 we feel its important that our employee partners fully understand the implications that the employee free choice act could have on their work environment and benefits
187357 weve always maintained the termination was not related to the union and that there was nothing unlawful about an answer provided an associate about merit pay
187358 following the decision we were considering offering reinstatement but that is on hold since the union appealed the decision
187359 this is a david and goliath confrontation but we believe well have enough stones in the sling to knock this out

187377 offload any doubts we had that it might actually be an effective technology
187378 there were moments there when there were a queue of media booked up for a month in advance and running one hour slots in the control room this is good for newham
187379 its one of those areas where it seems like we are pissing against the wind there is no end in sight to the enormity of privacy invasion and the enormity of surveillance

187382 e a ira do senhor se tornou a acender contra israel e incitou a davi contra eles dizendo vai numera a israel e a jud
187383 in the last few years there has been an explosion of street play from mixed reality games that combine the virtual and real to big games that transform cities into gameboards to the time honored traditions of stickball and scavenger hunts collectively we call these big games or street games games that transform public spaces games that you play in the real world too often street games are only discovered after theyve finished come out amp play is an opportunity for you to experience these games for yourselves
187384 just as that crazy christo transformed central park into a work of art the three day come out amp play festival will turn the city into a giant board for large as life street games approximately 20 events varying from camera phone enabled scavenger hunts to a wi fi location based competition from the guys behind the meta video game pacmanhattan will take place throughout the city
187385 takes the classic videogame minesweeper to the streets teams of four individuals race against each other to complete traditional minesweeper puzzles played out across a 4 square block urban area as with traditional minesweeper the goal of pervasive minesweeper is to uncover all tiles in the game space that do not have a mine under them in pervasive minesweeper each tile is a city block within a 4 square block area the tiles ares manipulated by a shotcode control panel hidden within each city block each players shotcode compatible mobile device is paired with their teams puzzle to prevent cross puzzle tampering each team is given a clue sheet as to the location of their sixteen control panels at this point a timer for the team is started once a control panel is located players may open a tile or flag it as a potential mine if a tile is opened and it is a mine that teams game is over if there is no mine under the tile a number is revealed on the teams xhtml display the number will tell the team how many mines are touching that tile left right above and below when a team has opened all tiles on their game board that do not contain mines the team has solved their puzzle and their timer stops the team that completes their puzzle in the least overall time is named the champion and awarded accordingly
187386 its kind of the lighter hearted flipside of a lot of new media high art
187387 i felt like a summer camp counselor leading children through tasks that were almost as time consuming as they were menial
187388 to the credit of the festival organizers though these people arent technically taking back the streets but ive never really found the city to have lost its sense of community or fun
187389 i cant keep with up with it all any more
187390 great works of art can still have a meaning for us which although it might not have been the intended message is still important
187391 the makers vision on the narrative possibilites of film and the role and position of the experiencing observer viewer
187392 while originally we had planned to walk rotterdam only our idea eventually evolved to one where in which we would reassess and walk three different cities in order to reassess the netherlands as something that is not an area at all our new media seminar
187393 holed up in classmate emma cohens house in the oud west section of the city and started recording audio emma is spending a semester in amsterdam a semester in amsterdam to repeat and has quite a bit to say about the city so does her host mother the wonderful and perceptive stella we stayed in emmas bedroom with some coffee a large map of amsterdam and a digital recorder and talked about sixteen places on the map we discussed the red light districts curious combination of vice and history the fractious debate surrounding an unbuilt mosque nearby and many other places heralded or unheralded in amsterdam
187394 we based the concept on our experiences in london while in london we made the box took a walk and listened to music people saw us coming and they would ask questions dance try to buy it and walk with us a while initially we thought amsterdam would be quite receptive to the riot box movement so we planned a walk directed by the people we planned to walk through vondel park and leidseplein when we came across people who engaged the box we would accompany them on their way for a while providing the music our original concept really got to the heart of the riot box movement the riot box walk challenged the traditional private culture of the ipod but still retains music portability
187395 the eight cubes show the journey of a person entering heaven recounting its life and then fades away in its grave i located on an amsterdam map a large park a couple of blocks away from a graveyard the park simulating the dream of heaven and the graveyard being reality
187396 decided to follow some people who were passing through the area and in doing so not only find out where they were going but experience the city as other amsterdammers and tourists do
187397 consisted of traveling across the city in a diagonal line of sorts the pattern that i created alternated between walking one block north and one block west while this pattern was pretty fun to follow it was sometimes not very exacting i was thrown off course several times by canals dead ends and the event of walking in squares this occurred when the block on which i walked curved too far back in the direction from which i had just come
187398 amsterdam is a city of canals nearly every street corner you stop at in central amsterdam has a canal visible in at least one direction as you can see by this map i was trying to get into the mindset of someone who was completely hydrophobic afraid of water and what itd be like to take a walk through amsterdam after further thought i realized that if i just walked while being afraid of water id just end up far from the center eventually and thered be no water to be afraid of to combat this problem i then put myself into the shoes of a person suffering from multi personality disorder wit one personality that is extremely afraid of bodies of water and the other that is very fond of water and stays near it at all costs

187410 in two years this is where i want to be
187411 to john schott who gave to cinema john mhiripiri jonas mekas
187412 evolved from roots and visions that go back to the early sixties when jonas mekas the director of the film makers cinematheque a showcase for avant garde films dreamed of establishing a permanent home where the growing number of new independent avant garde films could be shown on a regular basis this dream became a reality in 1969 when jerome hill p adams sitney peter kubelka stan brakhage and jonas mekas drew up plans to create a museum dedicated to the vision of the art of cinema as guided by the avant garde sensibility at its current home in a converted courthouse anthology has found an ideal home as a chamber museum dedicated to the preservation study and exhibition of independent and avant garde film it is the first museum devoted to film as an art form committed to the guiding principle that a great film must be seen many times that the film print must be the best possible and that the viewing conditions must be optimal
187413 i had a collection of 50 000 recordings and i tried to give them away to the library of congress or lincoln center
187414 mostly what i had was punk reggae hip hop and experimental art music
187415 we dont apply for any city state or federal grants
187416 almost everything is donated theres practically no acquisition budget and as for what well collect we never make quality decisions whatsoever
187417 our goal in the first twenty years was to build the collection and in the next twenty years to get it out to the public
187418 see i always found it really comforting here theres an urban legend that the sound comes out of some electrical current its not its art but its calming everythings crazy except this one tone which is constant
187419 whyd you go off and leave him alone in the house bobby
187420 i found a piece of paper in evans shirt pocket it had the directions on it
187421 he must have been planning to come here tonight to sell the drugs
187422 evan was a dealer i cant believe i went out with a drug dealer
187423 so you just took a chance that this is where i went
187424 yeah after i found the dart stuck in evans back i figured you hadnt killed him
187425 well what was i supposed think i go into the house for two minutes and when i come out evans dead and youre speeding away in your car but when i saw the dart i figured that maybe you had gone after the killer so i followed the directions it was the only clue i had
187426 and when i got here i saw your car in the driveway so i parked over here and ran up to their house i peeked in the window and saw that you were in trouble i figured if i could distract them for a minute you just might be able to escape fortunately your keys were in the ignition so i called 9 1 1 and gave them directions i told them to look for a black 66 gto then i started up your car dropped it into drive and just let it go up the driveway i knew it would pick up speed as it went along then i ran as fast as i could and went around to the back of the house and came in just as the truck alarm tripped
187427 but how could you be sure his alarm would be turned on
187428 actually i didnt even think about the possibility of a car alarm i figured the crash would be enough to get them out of the house
187429 the police are not going to be too happy with us for leaving the scene
187430 i think theyll forgive us weve just handed them three drug dealers
187431 no but you were behind me turn around and let me check you
187432 but i guess if hed hit one of us wed already be dead
187433 i must be going numb just like billy said i would
187434 your wallet saved you youre gonna need a new one
187435 no but if hed had his way with me i might have wished i was dead
187436 no i was running in front of you he couldnt have hit me besides like you said id already be dead
187437 you said you wanted to get a job why dont you come to work for me
187438 you wouldnt be youd be my personal assistant taking phone calls answering emails stuff like that
187439 look bella i need somebody i can trust not some nine to fiver wholl go telling everybody my business i want somebody whos smart tough and discrete
187440 somebody who can rescue you when you get yourself into trouble
187441 well i dont know maybe if i could take it on a trial basis and just see how it goes
187442 but no more kissing or grabbing thats not part of the deal
187443 yeah and my first order of business will be to make you go out and buy some new boxers those things are ugly even in the dark
187444 i must be crazy youre gonna be a big pain in the butt arent you
187445 uh im sorry i guess ive got the wrong house i was looking for john smith
187446 ive always wanted to take a big pistol and put it up to a mans head and squeeze the trigger just to watch his brains blow out the other side
187447 but wouldnt your neighbor hear the shot wouldnt he call the police
187448 nope not unless hes still up which is doubtful and even then his hearing aid would have to be cranked up all the way but dont get your panties in a wad boy daddy wouldnt be too happy if i killed you just for sport he likes to do the killing himself but i could tell him you made a run for it and thats why i shot you in the back wanna make a run for it boy
187449 ill tell you who he is hes the guy who attacked evan tonight too bad evan had to die but he went and did something stupid and was about to get himself arrested so i had to take him out and save the merchandise
187450 these babies are high tech they make them out of aircraft aluminum tubing i can hit the bulls eye at 250 feet
187451 i use a special poison from south america at first it just makes your body go all numb then your heart stops
187452 its fun to sit on the back porch and watch billy pick off stray dogs
187453 you know what ill just show him how it works
187454 and just to make it fair ill give him a good running start
187455 bobby go out in the garage and get a couple of them tie wraps
187456 now tie his hands behind his back and then tie his ankles together
187457 billy tells me that evan had been dating a woman named bella and that you had dinner with her tonight
187458 yes thats right i did have dinner with bella but i just met her for the first time tonight i dont really know her
187459 i wasnt following her i was following evan i saw him drive out of the parking lot as she was leaving i suspected he was going to follow her home turns out i was right
187460 just that she went out with him one time and when he asked her out again she said no after that he started stalking her
187461 what did she tell you he did for a living
187462 yes i do hes got an honest face and i always trust my instincts
187463 well go out there and shut it down before some cop happens to drive by
187464 it became cold and dark and suddenly it was light again i am very happy it was worth the trip
187465 from what i know of clark i dont think he would ever harm her physically
187466 hes a nice and gentle man so im not concerned about her safety no
187467 i think after going through the divorce and then having sandy and snooks move to london that he misses his little girl
187468 having supervised visits must be hard so he really wants to actually have his daughter back in his life
187469 i started baby sitting for her in the summer of 05 so she was about 4 years old and i thought she was a really sweet girl
187470 she was really smart i hope for the best for her she was a happy and cheerful young girl so hopefully she can become that as well sometime soon
187471 i dont know much between the relationship between sandy and clark
187472 but i know i thought they were very happy i saw them interact at least once or twice and they seemed very happy and quite the nice family
187473 clark although many things have changed you will always be reighs father and i will always be reighs mother we both love her dearly and have only her best interests and well being in our hearts
187474 there has to be a better way for us to solve our differences than this way i also want to thank everyone for your help
187475 and reigh honey i love you and miss you so much remember youre always a princess

187493 we had an illness outbreak that resulted in the premature euthanasia of about 56 animals

187495 i have nothing against a new shelter if we get enough funds but the best thing you can do is to avoid putting the shelter in different areas

187550 there are a dizzying number of economic and national security arguments for drilling at home a 700 billion oil balance of payments deficit a gas tax equivalent levied on the paychecks of american workers and poured into the treasuries of enemy and terror supporting regimes growing dependence on unstable states of the persian gulf and caspian basin

187587 politics does not shape culture culture shapes politics that has limited the rights long term political success in the past half century because peoples basic assumptions come from our liberal dominated culture from the education system entertainment and the media and these are all areas that conservatives have largely abdicated to the left we cannot move america back to the values our country was founded on solely through politics only a serious conscious effort toward cultural renewal can do that
187588 there are several fine organizations on the right attempting to influence culture but they are a separate and dispersed lot
187589 our objective is not only to bring more right of center individuals into the cultural influence professions but also to create a grand narrative of cultural renewal to make a case for the development of a culture of liberty in the united states today we will create a synergy and connection among all these groups and individuals whose efforts can make a bigger impact through cooperation and outreach beyond the right
187590 our think tank will do what other think tanks do write books position papers op eds and analyses run conferences and seminars and the like but with the objective of educating the culture industries about the value of liberty instead of writing for legislators and their staffs and people at other think tanks the culture project will target public school administrators hollywood agents producers and scriptwriters law school faculty members newspaper editors museum managers and other important people in the cultural influence professions
187591 what is most revolutionary about this is that our efforts will not be pursued as part of a culture war or from a polemical or partisan perspective we want to educate and persuade those who lean left not fight with them we want them to know we take their work seriously not just sitting in judgment on them but appreciating their accomplishments and we want them to know that they too will benefit from the establishment of a true culture of liberty in the united states

187593 e mail is used as a self validation tool by people to procrastinate and to re create activity versus productivity
187594 if its a multi party case it may generate maybe 20 e mails from other people
187595 so as youre trying to focus on it youre getting this ping ping ping as people are chattering about the e mail
187596 we all felt that information overload was something that was such a big problem that some companies were beginning to be aware of it but a lot of people didnt realize the magnitude of the problem
187597 distracted the erosion of attention and the coming dark age
187598 yet were connecting in thinner more faceless ways we experience fewer visits fewer telephone calls fewer contacts all around except e mail were subsisting on this diet of snippets and glimpses of each other socially
187599 if were having feelings with someone else that we need to confront
187600 many times well resort to an e mail rather than take the risk of picking up the phone and calling its a very egocentric act its dumping and it gets really misunderstood
187601 less than half a day goes by and youll get an e mail saying
187602 the expectation because youve sent it is the other person is looking at his screen all the time and his job is to look at his screen waiting for e mails
187603 were so overloaded by information bites that were less and less able to go deeply to create knowledge or wisdom out of all the information
187604 this is one reason why i say were on the cusp of a dark age
187605 but theyre ultimately times of cultural decline i think were defining our own dark age by skimming along on the surface of life and relationships and thoughts and its certainly a dark age when were faced with an ignorance born not out of a lack of information but out of an inability to create knowledge out of the information around us
187606 ken silva and i are friends we have had as do friends disagreements ranging from moderate to serious but we remain friends i want to share publicly what most do not know it has been suggested that ken is not even a brother in christ however in my personal interaction with him he has shown some fruit that even many who do not appreciate him have not shown both ken and mrs schlueter have criticized me and been criticized by me but neither i nor they have ever attempted to attack the right to blog here is the question i would ask if i had posted such a letter about you would you still be my friend ken still remains a friend and did not attempt to take down my blog because of my post is this not the behavior of a christian with anything i disagree with ken about he has acted as a brother in christ even when i have confronted him publicly and in private i always tell him i will still speak my conscience and he understands in that i salute him for showing forgiveness not many would continue to communicate with me given those circumstances even the non odms

187617 this amount of helium is approximately one percent of global annual production
187618 cern gets its helium under two delivery contracts most of it coming from two sources one in algeria and the other in russia for lhc filling the rates of delivery to cern had to be increased by a factor of five to a peak of 40 tonnes per month
187619 for example the final phase of cooling to 1 9k required the deployment of complex pumping systems combining several stages of cryogenic centrifugal compressors
187620 youtube for example allows you to reach audiences that you wouldnt reach otherwise and allows you to be in touch with them the fact that we allow people to comment on videos delivers the message that we are very open
187621 the idea really comes from our mandate to inspire the next generation of physicists we only put up official videos that were produced for the wider public whether they are aimed at kids or documentary style films what we dont want to do is to put very technical videos on there which people find too difficult and then end up looking somewhere else
187622 with the new web the global information landscape has changed such that it is no longer possible for cern to retain full control of information
187623 whilst newspapers have an address and can be sued contributors to blogs and social networking sites can be anonymous and may have a hidden agenda so readers need to exercise critical judgement as to the veracity of what they read
187624 p2p file sharing applications violate cerns computing rules on file services in most configurations see http htt rp cern ch security file sharing one reason is because they are known to be targets for viruses and some install spyware software that can steal confidential information such as bank account transactions removing spyware is usually not trivial and often requires re installation of computers from scratch
187625 our idea is not to make a radio programme but a conversation it means we do very little editing have no particular time constraints and let things take their course theres an honesty to it that is difficult to get with traditional media

187695 que la que fuera consejera de medio ambiente en la actualidad ha sido nombrada alto cargo de una empresa p blica del estado y su n mero dos entonces y ahora est n imputados y vayan a declarar en el mes de septiembre es muy grave
187696 hace que nos encontremos en un momento de extrema gravedad
187697 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
187698 we are not going to let anybody paint john mccain who has fought his entire life for equal rights for everyone to be able to be painted as racist
187699 weve seen this happen before and were not going to let it happen to us
187700 what barack obama was saying is hes not exactly from central casting for presidential candidates
187701 were not going negative in return were refuting the charges
187702 its a great ad and everybodys talking about it and were having a great time with it
187703 we didnt draw first blood i mean this campaign has been rough and tumble since the day barack obama got his nomination and weve withered under the attacks of the obama campaign on a daily basis
187704 i believe that behaviors that discriminate against or harass individuals or groups on the basis of their religious beliefs are reprehensible so why wasnt he disciplined or made to apologize the university of minnesota board of regents policy sic code of conduct prohibits such behavior in the workplace of course this includes the classroom and i expect those who work and study here to comply with that policy
187705 this is classic johnson admits myers has violated the umns code of conduct and then proceeds to tell us why he is being allowed to do so with a matter of academic freedom
187706 you have been lied to affiliate marketing is not easy system you can follow
187707 we talked about doing a joint together a whole album its not about just selling records for me anymore cause ive done that its about making something that people will remember

187712 being able to put all my love of chinese culture into a fantasy like the mummy and the wildness of it that was a challenge i couldnt turn down
187713 weve taken the premise of relocating the oconnells from egypt and putting them in china which is as we all know another archaeologically rich nation a long time ago rob was a harvard major in archeology with a special interest in chinese studies so this was a passion piece for him
187714 we have an idea of what he does how he does it
187715 getting to help defeat jet li that was kind of fun jet li is someone that is a power and entity

187718 on december 1st of 1981 where were emmett and rosalie that night at dinner
187719 there was understandable disappointment among harry potter fans when only one copy of the tales of beedle the bard was offered to the public last december
187720 i am therefore delighted to announce that thanks to the generous support of bloomsbury scholastic and amazon and with the blessing of all the wonderful people who own the other six original books the tales of beedle the bard will now be widely available to all harry potter fans
187721 notes by professor albus dumbledore which appear by generous permission of the hogwarts headmasters archive
187722 dumbledores commentary on the tales which was discovered among his papers after his death includes some historical notes personal reminiscences and insights into that most mysterious branch of magic wandlore
187723 i very much hope that readers coming to these classic wizarding fables for the first time will find his commentary both entertaining and helpful
187724 to benefit institutionalized children in desperate need of a voice
187725 miss hilton was not asked nor did she give permission for the use of her likeness in the ad and has no further comment
187726 i knew it was going to turn heads and that it was going to make a statement and we really appreciate that
187727 weve always been a band thats had things about us and things that are going on that creates big bold waves and whats so weird about the perception of the crusade is we wanted to show people that were not just a band thats going to stick to the same formula every time on that record we accomplished our main goal and that was to make it the exact opposite of 2005s ascendancy we didnt want to do anything that happened on that record on the next one but we still wanted to keep it us because we feel were a band that can broaden its sound and not just stick with one thing it was still metal and it was still trivium just different and diversified
187728 with this new record it basically summarizes everything we feel weve done right as a band that we feel are key ingredients of trivium all rolled into one with a new direction on top of it
187729 so it does have a little bit of everything weve done and some more it has as much singing on it as
187730 with the crusade we were done with screaming done with bands that did it done with doing it ourselves
187731 we just didnt want to do it anymore but when we started jamming for shogun and we heard how brutal and heavy some of the stuff was its the heaviest sh weve ever done before we tried singing over it and it wasnt right what was it missing the screaming and thats exactly what it needed
187732 we decided to take an old school approach to the record using new school technology purely for convenience because tape takes so f ing long to record with
187733 nick made us play this record the way metal is done these days you track it a couple of times make sure its perfect and then you go in and fix a couple of the pieces retrigger the guitars and drums thats just the way it is but we wanted to go back to the old school way record everything right with no triggers on our drums we had to make sure the performance was there and the energy was there and hearing the end result the stuff nick drew out of us is just unreal in terms of heaviness and brutality its the best thing weve done before wed never really considered ourselves a contender for even the word heavy or brutal but this time things are different
187734 just a big combination of everything wed loved as kids
187735 everyone weve played it for theyre all really excited about it
187736 i think weve found our sound weve just discovered it and with the next one i think well define it it takes a band a little while to find their sound some bands get it on the first record and some bands it takes several i think were one of those bands thats going to develop and fully come into our sound someday we dont know what record that will be but this record is even closer to what its going to be

187739 just for personal reasons and you know because its miley and theyre gonna do good were gonna do good too the audience is gonna vote so well see
187740 were not gonna see it until its live so i have no idea
187741 yeah i was surprised it got so big that we had to do it somewhere like this
187742 the tension is building up and people are getting nervous were gonna smoke the audience
187743 what do you expect i mean were real people i have nothing bad to say about anybody
187744 thats definitely been the rumor and its been coming from their camp so i really cant conform that at all i positively cannot confirm that i hear that its his birthday that weekend so he might be in town but these guys youre never going to know anything until the last minute anyway thats what ive been told ive heard those same rumors and that would be really cool right but there are definitely no guarantees youll just have to settle on listening to great music
187745 tom morello man i tell you what tom morello is the real deal and you will not be disappointed
187746 well you start walking the grounds and they start loading everything in and you see sort of how your blueprints working out
187747 youve got everything from the stages to the sound and lights to your backstages your artist area your vip area your cabana area and then you get floods of friends and guests that want to come and where are you going to accommodate them and you get new areas youre putting in you always have sound issues because you have so many stages so you have to position each stage and the speakers so they dont affect that other area
187748 weve got a ton of trees in grant park and were really maximizing those trees this year
187749 aside from the music the other thing were creating here is a scene
187750 its the most important aspect of lollapalooza aside from the music and the musicians themselves it goes right to the audience and whos there people want to bop around and meet people and maybe hook up so were always looking to create social situations and social stimulations within the grounds
187751 as far as our single day ticket counts radiohead seem to have taken this year
187752 radiohead sold out first and their production is just incredible
187753 we also have nine inch nails and trent reznors production is one of the best in the world
187754 i can tell you that on the inside hes ramping up if you thought nine inch was great before and the production was great before theyre stepping it up that much more now and when jack white came in with the raconteurs the first time lots of people said it was the best act weve had i am assuming these guys have developed and evolved together so thats going to be a great rock show
187755 this year i couldnt ask for a better lineup but its going to be quite something to top 2008 we are the biggest festival in the country overflowing with 75 000 people a day so i think this year were done weve done it but next year were already speaking and planning and guess what next year looks fantastic it really is unbelievable

187759 if you notice since britney spears started wearing clothes and behaving paris hilton is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
187760 if the ones that attract the paparazzi behave in the first place like we expect of anybody that solves about 90 percent of the problem the rest we can deal with
187761 i forget the exact terminology but the comment was made in terms of her activities now seem to be that shes calmed down and shes in a relationship thats quieted her down and as such she seems to be attracting less attention and theres less activity that the paparazzi all of you are focusing on
187762 but i mean i like everybodys verse because i think that lupe killed it kanye killed it mine was more about style than how dope the rhyme was it was really my melody that i liked more than anything thats why my vocal approach was a little different from what you would hear me do i wanted to just do something different that would look different on me
187763 the concept is based on old 80s video game graphics playing behind us while were rhyming
187764 we just want to have fun with the project in a day and age where the record industry is what it is im lucky enough to be on a label that understands and theyll just let us have fun
187765 all the girls standing in the line for the bathroom

187774 after the eighth album im done i already feel it i love acting i love my music like i said but i feel it after this one probably one more in me and thats eight like im one album behind nas and thats crazy
187775 its funny because everybody always wants to talk about you know bow wow doesnt curse hes clean which is true
187776 i think a lot of people that are jumping on bow wow now are new people and if you listen to my first album i was being bad on my first album
187777 i still have the younger generation the younger kids look up to me then again i have that other fanbase who was with me from the jump who are now adults too and its almost like i gotta cater to both but if i miss one of em theyll go find that other person to fill that slot
187778 i know the girls theyre going to go crazy when they see it
187779 the ladies are gonna go crazy when they see bow wows first sex scene its crazy cause for me it was normal it was normal but i know when i look back at it when i see it im gonna be like damn look at this this is crazy i stun myself sometimes i cant even front

187816 we are sorry to see them leave the area but we know they arent going to leave our spirits and our support
187817 nick wanted to know what he could do to be of help and got others involved
187818 vinny testaverde has been involved chad pennington and his wife have been involved and many other players as well
187819 we do our share of soles program with the foundation providing backpacks and brand new shoes for the homeless children that they work with so they can go to school on the first day with brand new shoes and a brand new backpack
187820 we actually have a little clothing store where people can take clothing for free and debbie helps set that up and interacts with the guests
187821 she also will help in the kitchen as well when were short handed with volunteers to serve the food she has been absolutely phenomenal
187822 the way she started is she usually went twice a week then shes been involved in the big fundraising ball they have ever year and shes really enjoyed the fundraising experience they do a great job feeding the people who are obviously in need and providing clothing
187823 we have 25 apartments for families who are turning their lives around we have three emergency shelters for people who are homeless at the moment and we have about 100 people in the three emergency shelters two for families and one for single men
187824 i saw early on as a lot of people recognize that you can emotionally burn out from just being exposed to the trauma of other peoples lives
187825 but fortunately because of the dignity and respect that is shown to everybody we see hope every single day
187826 i think a lot of times people get caught up with their own lives and forget a lot of people go without the basic necessities
187827 anytime you can help provide whatever that is within your own budget for someone else who lives without the basic necessities i think its extremely important as human beings we all have an obligation to help one another
187828 i keep hearing people talk about my gray hair and my age but i feel like im 24 man
187829 im just out here running with the guys everyone is going to be sore every now and again but i feel like a young kid again when i step out on the grass
187830 in previous years i was 265 and last year i was 268
187831 its a huge difference man it takes a load off your knees and you get more endurance more stamina by being at a lighter weight
187832 i got on the treadmill for 30 or 40 minutes every other day staying in miami i also had to get used to the heat and humidity so i walked around the track for about an hour sometimes
187833 if they would have told me i was playing corner i would have been a little nervous about it playing mike i was fine with that
187834 i did play it in high school but back then i was always bigger than everybody so i would just go hit everybody right now theres a little bit more technique involved and im fine with it
187835 sometimes im second team so i might be out there with a rookie and i might have to get him lined up sometimes
187836 if i understand the defense and the concepts by the end of camp ill be good
187837 we have a lot of different guys who can do things i played basically every position on defense except secondary ive played mike will tackle end ive done it all bt calvin pace eric barton all those guys are interchangeable
187838 most of the stuff we do is stuff weve done with mike westhoff the scheme hasnt changed dramatically
187839 there are a few new words here or there but our coach is an aggressive guy and hes really meticulous about technique so thats the thing weve been working on and coaching up in the classroom
187840 he was like hey i saw you lift up on this route or you didnt do what you did before on the last one he really got into specifics small things and broke it down for me
187841 hell pull you to the side and say the next time you run this route try this out for guys like me and chansi stuckey our second year in the league that helps
187842 its a tight knit group so that makes it easier
187843 its part of being a teammate down to the little things like showing support especially on a hot morning like this its good to give the other guys encouragement
187844 all my life ive been battling for positions working hard to get coaches attention its something thats become me because i had to work for everything to get to this point
187845 i know that the little things have helped me get to this point so i just cant take anything for granted
187846 hell catch it and he bursts and hes looking to score every time
187847 hes one of the few guys who practices like they play
187848 hes a big back and hes obviously got thump but hes got some speed and a little quickness to him
187849 the biggest thing that i took from him is how hard he ran and the power he ran with he hit the hole with his shoulders squared running with a lot of speed and so much force i try to work that into my game
187850 its something that a good running back has to be able to do
187851 its not the glamorous part of the position but its part of the game and cant be ignored its a skill that has to get honed up
187852 you cant turn your head and look to run before you make the catch you become good at catching by concentrating
187853 intel has demonstrated that the performance of their systems can help facebook scale our infrastructure and continue to deliver the best experience to users around the world
187854 is he making good plays is he not whats happening
187855 but ive heard from a bunch of people and hopefully it was a good picture they put up of me any publicity is somewhat good but it is nice for my family to see me back home
187856 im just trying to go out and earn a spot just earn a job and do whatever i can
187857 he struggled he came in great guy great worker but getting out the play it was like an act of congress to get that done in the huddle
187858 i dont know if it was that hard i struggled a little bit with it last year but ive definitely improved on that
187859 its not quite as hard to get a play off now
187860 that quarterback room sets a pretty high bar for work ethic and hes right there with them
187861 hes impressive in terms of just continually absorbing the chunks of information and getting better the guy thats here now versus the guy that was here a year ago its night and day
187862 i was just thankful for the opportunity i was given and i tried to take advantage of that last year my opportunity was to be on the practice squad i played receiver for most of the year
187863 i had hoped or planned that we would have a consolidation year where we just went and marketed instead of this frantic listing that weve been doing weve been doing it non stop since mid 2002 theres some logic in giving it a rest for a year and then spend a bit of time marketing it
187864 gold staged a 30 dollar bounce off of yesterdays lows to 925 earlier in the session but drifted back to 914 in the afternoon despite the bounce the overall price action is bearish while we remain below 935 downside support is seen at 888 the 200 day moving average and 76 4 retrenchment

187867 in the past the combat medical badge was only awarded to those medics serving with ground units for one reason or another flight medics were unable to qualify for the badge
187868 they are willing to go anywhere anytime to do the hard work and its just impressive
187869 when they get the call they dont know what they are getting into all they know is that they are going to save a soldiers life or any human being for that matter these guys are truly angels of mercy
187870 it is sort of a thankless job most people think all we do is pick up and drop off patients and only give us credit for that we dont get credit for the times when we retrieve patients under fire or treat them while in flight
187871 so these 7 people are the first and i very happy to be here to see the duty first bde 1st inf div be the first to award the combat medic badge to air medevac medics
187872 we designed the ip master trainer program to try to get the biggest impact from a small element of u s soldiers
187873 we hand picked ip who displayed leadership potential at their stations and brought them in for training
187874 these guys have come a long way since the beginning and they are using what we have taught them
187875 in the beginning they would run disorganized into a room to clear it now the last day of training they are going into the room in a stack
187876 overall this group of ip has made a dramatic improvement in their capabilities
187877 the compact water treatment unit was originally built by the army corps of engineers
187878 the day it opened in june 2007 terrorists blew up the school next to it causing severe damage to the cwtu
187879 more than 12 000 people were not receiving water because of a war that was going on around them
187880 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
187881 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
187882 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
187883 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
187884 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
187885 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government
187886 i detest what you write but i would give my life to make it possible for you to continue to write
187887 and let others enjoy the privilege to do so too
187888 we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract
187889 we cannot dedicate we can not consecrate we can not hallow this ground
187890 they pick the most dangerous enemy they can find and its themselves
187891 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
187892 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
187893 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
187894 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
187895 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
187896 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
187897 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american
187898 even the fear of going in a wrong direction is an ego trip
187899 i think overall it was kind of a pleasant surprise
187900 the market was bracing for a potentially poor number and it was only 51 000
187901 there is a perception that the european economy is slowing down
187902 there is a possibility that from a cyclical perspective adownturn may have begun late last year
187903 my biggest worry is price hikes driven by rising rawmaterial costs
187904 in terms of putting any industrialcombination together there is no discussion
187905 mtn is a great company great management that is thereason we thought it is a strategic fit and it is really theircall it is not our call
187906 people really thought the non farm payrolls number wasgoing to be a bad number youre bouncing back in equityfutures from the fact that the number wasnt as bad
187907 our discussion with respective state grids is in advanced stages we are also in discussion with the power regulator after obtaining various permissions from the respective bodies the construction work on the plant would commence
187908 becasue of rising freight cost the import of raw petroleum coke the raw material for cpc has become costlier therefore we are evaluating options to set up conversion units in middle east where cpc demand is growing leaps and bounds
187909 the congress led government may think it can utilise the situation to push through various legislations like the pension bill the banking amendment bill and the foreign educational providers bill which the left had been opposing we will work hard to see that such legislation is defeated on the floor of the house
187910 his government because it is committed to follow the policies dictated by washington the imf and the world bank is refusing to take the measures suggested by the left parties to curb price rise
187911 if offers of a berth in the union cabinet threats of unleashing investigating agencies against unwilling opposition mps and bribes running into crores of rupees have enabled the government to survive how long can this last a few months later the congress led coalition has to go to the people in the lok sabha elections
187912 the congress leadership thought it had isolated the cpi m and the left parties by winning over the samajwadi party to its side but by mobilising various parties against the nuclear deal and against the upa government more forces have joined hands with the left parties after the withdrawal of support to the government the bahujan samaj party the unpa the janata dal secular headed by deve gowda and the rashtriya lok dal headed by ajit singh joined hands with the left to oppose the congress led alliance
187913 manmohan singh has bettered the record of his predecessor p v narasimha
187914 i think at the end of the day it was one of those situations that caught me off guard
187915 i didnt realize i was working so hard to actually capture his attention that really showed me thats the day i realized i made it
187916 the concept is to bring all the people together as one person linking as one world at the state of where the world is now with all these wars and conflict all over the place i think a record like that is needed thats the best time when a voice needs to be heard i felt like what better voice between me and mike to be able to say something like that at the time we in outside of trying to do a club record or a record we expect to get thousand of spins it was more so lets do a record that fits all formats but also has some meaning to it but of course for the future well be finishing up the rest of the record
187917 were gonna set up a whole tour around it its a big play
187918 she was mad cool down to earth yet conservative polite she felt like a high school friend she felt mad approachable cool as hell we had a great time working the chemistry was right on point the record shows it because we came up with a smash
187919 i realize i been foolish i never should have turned my back
187920 cause its a cold world when youre out there all alone so many times i wanted to pick up the phone and tell you ooh baby baby i miss your loving so
187921 do you think we can pick up where we left off before the day that i told you it was over packed my things and moved away
187922 she really aint actually we switched some words around so people dont think she was singing about bobby this record is more of a record that anyone going through that situation would be able to relate to its just the fact that she got out of a situation is what made it more relevant im doing two records for her album
187923 despite continued uncertainty in the marketplace company exceeded our quarterly revenue guidance and our sequential growth once again outpaced our peer group in the second quarter
187924 several business segments including financial services performed well during the quarter furthermore company generated continued strong performance across europe and healthy growth from our business knowledge process outsourcing and it infrastructure services practices as a result of clients focusing on cost efficiencies
187925 as our recent product capacity and liquidity actions clearly demonstrate we are reacting rapidly to the challenges facing the u s economy and auto market and we continue to take the aggressive steps necessary to transform our u s operations
187926 we have the right plan for gm driven by great products building strong brands fuel economy technology leadership and taking full advantage of global growth opportunities
187927 lives and dies by its ability to sustain above average growth in both its sales and earnings
187928 the company is replacing a higher margin product with a lower margin product and this dynamic is exacerbated by rising commodities prices
187929 all beverage categories are dominated by an oligopoly of drinkmakers when the companys valuation drops lower well see hansen get acquired for now there is no rush
187930 business conditions for the automobile industry deteriorated sharply again in the second quarter due to further ongoing steep rises in oil and raw material prices the weakness of the u s dollar the impact of the international financial crisis and a weaker u s economy
187931 we now expect that the pretax return on sales for the year to be at least 4
187932 if however the situation on the car markets particularly for preowned cars does not ease over the course of 2008 there is a risk that this could have a negative impact on bmw groups earnings for the year
187933 a few of the residents have stopped in to talk and theyre thrilled
187934 they wanted to go home and we all wanted them to go home
187935 im just hoping to go back to my life at this point
187936 but when they do let us back in to our house were not even sure well have water because were so remote all the wells run on electricity we have no idea what well do with the animals if we dont even have water
187937 the road is open but the major issue is that the helicopters that are dipping down into the river sucking up water
187938 people stop to take pictures of this especially foreign tourists because its exciting and fascinating but we need to keep those people going
187939 it was pretty much the same with the last record
187940 weve been working on acoustic guitars and then trying to bring it all together as a full band were not sure whats going to happen yet but weve been having a lot of fun we havent stopped writing songs since we stopped recording pretty odd because we have a lot to write about
187941 its sounding pretty awesome which is probably what were going to call the next record
187942 weve got quite a few new ideas and songs weve been working on and were hoping to record some of that stuff by the end of the year
187943 i can tell you its on our latest record its in the middle somewhere
187944 i went and got a fake id with a different name and i have a pair of sunglasses and a hat
187945 the game is incredibly accurate its identical and its so intuitive for me as a player that i have become better at my instrument its gotten me a hotter girlfriend its made me better looking and ive made more money since playing it
187946 that or you pick out of a hat which is not fun we can run faster than dashboard confessional so if it comes down to a foot race it should be us
187947 were working stuff out with his management and were talking about splitting the cost of a ping pong table to take out
187948 get out and vote or the end will be near
187949 the world is ready for change because obama is here
187950 any chair unless hes paralyzed yeah i said it cause bush is mentally handicapped
187951 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to this song is not only outrageously offensive to senator clinton reverend jackson senator mccain and president bush it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
187952 i heard about his skills when he was doing his thing in chicago i definitely heard some rumors that he was going to run but i just wanted to feel his vibe man hes real down to earth his energy is great hes just an honest dude and hes all about change im all for change im just pro obama i dont think theres anybody better who can be put in that office right now besides that man

187972 iptv operators around the world have shown that systems are scalable and can handle rapid growth in subscriber numbers
187973 however developing and agreeing to standards will help these operators deliver iptv more simply and effectively over a variety of access technologies and help to drive higher uptake in other markets
187974 this report shows that although dsl remains the key vehicle for delivering broadband associated services alternative access technologies such as fibre are increasing their footprints and their requirements need to be considered in our work
187975 the broadband forum recognises this and is working hard to make sure fibre is integrated seamlessly in to existing broadband architectures and management platforms worldwide

188049 we interviewed the people who have inspired us with the hope that they will inspire and teach others
188050 the plain fact is that washington is disappointed and has decided not to take him seriously the real washington needed to have a first hand look at the man they were being asked to deal with after general musharraf
188051 lacking the depth of understanding and vision in dealing with complex international and security issues articulation to comprehend and project pakistani policies in a clear and candid way
188052 the washingtonians got the message that they were dealing with a non entity and should not take him seriously
188053 the level of discourse and understanding came crashing down to earth
188054 this was a menu full of vulgarities for a man who was not even in control of his own office was surrounded by appointees who received orders from other power centres and reported the results somewhere else he was mercilessly thrown to the wolves and made into a punching bag in washington
188055 it is now trying to mitigate the damage this move by the government reflects the reality the need to control the intelligence agencies in pakistan the need to say that the policies of pakistan are made by the civilian government and not decided anywhere in the ghq general headquarters in rawalpindi or in the isi headquarters
188056 the fact that there is a reversal sends the message that nothing can be done without the consent of the military without the consent of the isi itself and this message doesnt help gilani in one sense he gilani reinforces the perception that these forces the pakistan army and the isi act independently and that the political government is not necessarily responsible for it
188057 they the government are powerless against it and no one wants to cooperate with someone who is powerless
188058 we all know that it is going to take time to do something meaningful i think that what has been understood now is the fact that in the long term there is no real solution without the predominance of the civilians over the military the past eight years have proved that a military government is a disaster ultimately pakistan is much worse off today with all these issues and in the security situation as well
188059 its going to be frustrating its going to be exasperating at some point theyll be a lot of disillusion of mistrust i mean something needs to be done at some point but patience is part of the equation as well

188152 these two students are getting to do a little bit of everything with these internships they have great mentors at radnor and are getting excellent hands on experience these internships allow our department to participate in the community at large and allow jesse and paige to add to a body of research knowledge in their field of study
188153 jon lowrance is one of the main reasons these two students are here with us we were able to pay for one intern through state funds and receive a second intern through lipscomb its a perfect example of the state working with the private sector to mutually benefit both groups they are getting to do research that most students dont have access to we are getting two exceptional interns
188154 jesse and paige did a lot of legwork for this project once i arrived at radnor we worked together using identical sampling methods that other scientists had used we systematically measured the forest again it was exciting to work with the students and share with them the techniques used in the field of historical ecology radnor lake is a rare gem to study and this work will be part of the science of long term ecological research my hope is that my research will give steve ward radnor an idea of how forests will change in the future in order to maintain a mature forest and make management decisions about the future of the natural area
188155 it was very interesting to work with a professor onsite we were recording data on the types and sizes of trees we located i had studied ecology in the classroom but this work was a lot more in depth dr loeb was open to questions and he shared a lot of his information and research techniques with us i also enjoyed being available to help with other projects this summer has given me a good window to view the life of the rangers and researchers this internship has been mentally and physically hard at times but you really feel like you have accomplished something when the day is done
188156 i enjoyed all of my experiences at radnor i have been able to work on research with dr arnett through my previous lipscomb classes this summer jesse and i also helped out with water quality research projects getting to know the kids through radnors educational programs has also been fun i really enjoyed working with the junior ranger program and going on one of the canoe floats down the buffalo river we helped with a ten mile clean up float where participants cleaned up debris from the banks it was a fun day and it made a difference
188157 jesse and paige were very bright motivated students working with them made what could have been an arduous task very rewarding i hope other students i work with are of the same caliber as paige and jesse

188334 we are hearing voices i believe those inside the rubble will be saved
188335 we almost wish this had been a whodunit but we know who did it the real question was how could they
188336 though it was her mother who actually killed her there are many layers of blame for what happened to danieal kelly from parents to case workers to supervisors to administrators
188337 cheryl ransom garner who was dhs commissioner when danieal died helped set the tone of accountability at dhs when she testified before the grand jury she was asked whether she believed that anyone from dhs bore any responsibility for danieals death she answered that she did not
188338 the dysfunction at dhs goes deep down to the bone
188339 despicable as the parents were they were not that remarkable there are people like that in the world that is why dhs and the private company hired by dhs exist yet these agencies whose sole function is to be protecting children from such parents passed up almost every opportunity over a period of years to save danieal
188340 in the final weeks of her life danieals brother himself only a child kept telling his mother that something was wrong but she dismissed him shortly before his sister died he begged his mother to call an ambulance she refused only the next day with flies buzzing all over her body was 911 contacted
188341 during this investigation we found a tall filthy cardboard box in dhs social worker dana poindexters cubicle big enough to hold a file cabinet the box was filled to the top with random case files food wrappers and unopened business envelopes some with four year old postmarks at the bottom of the pile was danieals file
188342 even when she personally visited the kelly apartment dhs social worker laura sommerer failed to check on danieal on the last occasion five weeks before the childs death when she had already lost 50 of her weight and at times was left sitting in her own urine and feces sommerer noticed nothing amiss at all
188343 there was plenty of manpower at dhs to make sure that danieal kelly received the services that would not only have saved but improved her life the failure to do so was a failure of inclination at every level of the agency
188344 at least one dhs administrator herself back dated reports about danieal some by more than a year with false dates and determinations to make it look like they had been properly completed she said this was a common practice at dhs
188345 on the afternoon and evening of danieals death part owner director of multiethnic behavior health mickal kamuvaka convened what in essence was a forgery fest in her office she directed employees to concoct almost a years worth of false progress reports to substitute for all the work that had never actually been done
188346 on june 24 2004 dhs received a third report about danieal this time from an anonymous female neighbor
188347 mr miller said he was moved to make the report to dhs because i seen danieal kelly upstairs in a hot room laying in pee no curtains no blinds no fans just laying in pee according to mr miller no one from dhs ever contacted him about this report
188348 the grand jury finds the evidence that the mistreatment suffered by danieal the malnutrition the bed sores the lack of stimulation and the dehydration and heat stress caused her death the photographs taken of danieal first as the healthy and high spirited child enrolled in arizona later as a skeletal corpse in a philadelphia morgue do not lie danieal was a victim of homicide

188455 kissing the hajr e aswad is a very desirable and honourable action however pushing bullying fighting and quarrelling with people in order to jump the line represent the worst actions a pilgrim can do in the masjid al haram sometimes people in ahraam fight with other pilgrims which destroys the spirit of their umrah or hajj in the state of ahraam fighting quarrelling pushing bullying hurting people yelling and screaming is haram forbidden how do people figure that their umrah or hajj will provide them with any benefit when they fight and use vulgar language while in the state of ahraam in fact this person is simply increases his stock of sins by fighting and yelling in the state of ahraam it is important to remember that islam is about the essence of the act not simply the act alone one does not have to physically touch the stone in order to gain its benefits therefore if a person is unable to reach the hajr e aswad due to the large crowds then this person can symbolically kiss the hajr e aswad from a distance and his kiss will still be as good as someone really kisses the haj e aswad prophet muhammad peace be upon him himself did this symbolic kiss many times he wanted other people to get the chance why do pilgrims not look to the holy prophets peace be upon him example remember in islam the reward of all actions is based upon the intention not on the actual action but when you know that you may cause unintentional harm to someone then stay away from that action allah will reward you insha allah for being careful and being considerate of others a person who causes harm to himself or other pilgrims while trying to kiss hajr e aswad will gain no benefits from his her kiss instead the person will be committing a sin in masjid al haram the worst thing a pilgrim could do

188481 i went to watch her yesterday i expected her to be good
188482 this is my first tournament since wimbledon so its hard to get the rhythm back i was fighting a lot in this match and thats why i won but i give her all credit
188483 i got a little bit tight sometimes but i think i did pretty well throughout the whole match
188484 shes a grand slam champion shes a really great player she was running me side to side and it was really tough but it was a fun match it was a good fight and i enjoyed myself
188485 the first thing i was thinking was well girl you made it
188486 the second thing was that it was the first top 10 player ive beaten ive had a lot of chances before and played some great matches but never did that it was also the first night match i won in my career so there were a lot of first times today i dont know how but i managed it
188487 it was very frustrating because i didnt know how it was going to pull up i was in pain through the whole match
188488 the pain wasnt so sharp but i couldnt hold my racquet on my forehand i tried to fight as much as i could i really wanted to win this match but obviously shes a very good player she figured it out
188489 i took out two canadians maybe the people here will start to hate me now
188490 in those two matches the crowd was obviously against me its not easy to be in this kind of atmosphere but i tried my best i really wanted to focus on myself and my game on what i have to do in order to win im pleased with how i handled it im happy to have gotten through this match

188505 net users everywhere should be worried by this memorandum of understanding between the bpi and the six largest isps in the uk faults exist at every level
188506 the first stage gives the bpi the right to track file sharers and pass their details onto isps thats an attack on civil liberties in itself but the true folly of the scheme rests in what those isps can do next
188507 their new powers run in two halves initially they merely send warning letters to suspected file sharers if these fail to deter them the isps threaten to slow or cut off their internet connections this is a hugely disproportionate response
188508 it would not matter who had done the sharing it would not matter if it was someone else in the building it would not matter if your machine had been assaulted by malware and used without your knowledge the isps will target suspects which means that many people on shared internet connections will be cut off under these rules

188575 hey its definitely not ben affleck but it is someone who starred with him in a film once of course that could be a lot of people so lets narrow it down to b actor 95 films although two great television appearances that come to mind are also part of his resume he has basically been off the radar the past year oh sure a bit part here and a bit part there but this actor with the a list facial recognition has spent the better part of the past year in rehab not quite the crack smoking in the living room firing off shotguns but he did manage to abuse just about every drug you can imagine over the past three years what finally sent him to rehab though was his ex wifes promise to take away visitation rights of their child ren if he didnt stop leaving her him them unattended so he could both score and use drugs the drug paraphernalia littering the floor was probably also not good parenting
188576 nobody reported it as a racial comment the only time this became an issue was when mccain campaign manager rick davis and their campaign decided to kick it up and make it a racial issue

188608 barack obama has a long record of bipartisan accomplishment and we appreciate that it is respected by his democratic and republican colleagues in the senate but in this race oregonians should know that barack obama supports jeff merkley for senate merkley will help obama bring about the fundamental change we need in washington
188609 based on the survey results i see little change going forward for the region with excessive inflationary pressures and slight job losses and an economy that continues to grow at an anemic pace without strong farm income and healthy exports the regional economy would already be dipping into recessionary territory
188610 as in previous months job expansions linked to exports healthy farm income and biofuels production were more than offset by the negative impact of higher energy and commodity prices
188611 for the second quarter job losses for the region as a whole have been less than 0 5 percent annualized i expect the region to continue to lose jobs at this pace for the next three to six months
188612 higher energy and commodity prices combined with the flood of bad news stemming from the national mortgage banking sector have clearly undermined supply managers economic outlook six months down the road
188613 the cheap dollar which makes u s goods less expensive abroad pushed the new export orders index to 55 4
188614 while this is healthy it is down from junes more robust 59 2 and reflects slowing economic growth for our trading partners at the same time the weak dollar has yet to really restrain imports to any great degree the july import index rose to 56 3 from junes 53 8
188615 we have withdrawn support to the congress how can there be any support to the party in the event of a hung parliament

188618 ive commented mathematical formalism in economics before see here and here i will here aside from linking to these posts only add that mathematical formalism does not prevent bad ideas you can express any theory including communist ones as a bunch of greek letters and then differentiate them and pretend that this operation have somehow made it scientific far from stopping bad theories mathematical formalism will help advance them because they will distract from the actual issue at hand by instead focusing on series of differentiated greek letters
188619 of course government skews choices but my point is government never skews choices to be undertaken that would not otherwise also be by definition increasing positive subjective value and hence voluntarily undertaken
188620 and housing is far far in a galaxy far far away from being net
188621 even today we have a huge shortage of all types of housing which would exist in the absence of government interference in the market
188622 what of people who go to disneyland instead investing in stocks or a training course
188623 the ever decreasing owner occupancy rates and the millions of empty homes across the country
188624 the distortion of market indicators and information has led to a greater degree of capital investment that is not in line with consumer time preferences and their propensity to save
188625 had the state not intervened some of that money spent on housing though not every penny of it would have gone toward investing in capital that improves productivity
188626 hes been consistent in his view of global imbalances over several years now
188627 as rtr pointed out people splurging out on frivolities would be poorer than if they actually spent it on something meaningful skills that would further their productivity
188628 but they borrowed to make those new houses that are now worth less while their debt obligations havent correspondingly decreased how is that wealthier not to mention what more productive use that money would have been better spent

188638 this just shows again how bush republicans are bankrolling barlettas feeble fundraising effort
188639 by taking and keeping the stevens money barletta basically buys into the gop culture of corruption that forced them out of the leadership in congress in 2006 and still persists today special interests like halliburton and oil companies dominate the bush administration lobbyists run the mccain campaign and indicted public officials contribute to barletta
188640 this campaign has not received a contribution from the pac in question
188641 if its too dangerous to touch it cant be clean
188642 we have withdrawn support to the congress how can there be any support to the party in the event of a hung parliament

188645 she is talking about some other conspiracy which she alone knows and which her party also does not know
188646 the things that have happened to convert a minority government to majority to engineer defections to manage cross voting this victory was managed by cross voting and the left has not been isolated
188647 is not in national interest is full of lies and an exaggeration
188648 he has waved away all of the concerns over inflation all the concerns over growth and as a consequence he presented a spring budget devoid of action now the economy has ground to a halt these are serious errors of judgment
188649 furthermore we need to strengthen swedish productivity it remains very low and this is of great concern for our competitiveness it is thus totally wrong to cut back on education and training as the government has done
188650 the government has made a great many people employable but has not taken care of that which companies need in order to employ more people small businesses have created 80 000 new jobs over the past five years while large companies and the public sector have cut back 10 000 people

188655 they say on the news they arrested people because of the bombing on gaza beach but they didnt even ask me about it they know i dont even know how to use a gun they just want to scare us
188656 we dont arrest people just to arrest people there are no political reasons
188657 i say clearly anyone who is found to have nothing to do with the bombing will be released

188670 we are hearing voices i believe those inside the rubble will be saved
188671 in five years now the sky has not fallen the earth has not opened to swallow us all up and more to the point thousands and thousands of good people contributing members of our society are able to make free decisions about their personal future and we ought to seek to affirm that every chance we can
188672 what we can do is tend our own garden and make sure that its weeded and i think weve weeded out a discriminatory law
188673 pay really close attention and it really is so simple to put it out at the end of the day were telling people to just add water and stir
188674 thats the key thing stir up that fire make sure its good and cold because unfortunately we are still finding a number of campfires out there that are not being attended or people have left the site and the fires are still warm or hot in some cases
188675 sometime this rain although it can be a blessing for the fire hazard it also can be a curse because it gives folks a false sense of security while we did get some rain we are still at a high hazard and with just a little bit of sunny weather we can bounce back quickly from that moisture so we need people to remember we are still at a high hazard and there still is potential for fires to spread out there
188676 witnesses say it burned within four minutes it was fully engulfed by the time we arrived on scene and it had spread into a grass fire
188677 luckily none of the workers were in their tents at the time they had all gone to the lake to cool off the fire was about three or four feet from the nearest tent before we got it knocked out
188678 just as parents dont choose him hoping to sway his vote parents dont choose to receive his services at a particular hospital because dr coburn has somehow endorsed that hospital because he is a senator

188680 has sen leahy provided an improper endorsement to warner brothers for appearing in batman
188681 will millions of americans now see batman not because it features stars like christian bale or the late heath ledger but because patrick leahy a distinguished united states senator has offered his illustrious endorsement to this motion picture
188682 if sen coburn can only deliver babies for free at a public hospital shouldnt sen leahy only be allowed to donate his notable thespian skills to a public entity like pbs

188707 its fantastic we were all a bit surprised we knew graham had got out of hospital on wednesday
188708 but for graham to walk into the club it was overwhelming for the players its just terrific to see graham back
188709 we realise graham has an enormous amount of work in his recovery but its just fantastic to see him back around the club
188710 aw no doubt its been a tough few weeks with everything thats happened with graham and at richmond
188711 to see graham walk into the rooms this morning it just put a smile on everyones face
188712 graham hasnt spoken to the players ive got no doubt hell come into the team meeting and have a sit down so we might have a bit of fun with him when that does occur
188713 i hope it does help geelong are a very very good football side so every one per cent that we can gain and no doubt were all feeling really happy for graham hes made the place a happier place because hes come back
188714 were still a long way off part of the rehabilitation from my understanding was just him coming down here today and i guess how he handles all the attention
188715 to see him now and where hes come hes come a long way but we all realise hes got a long way to go

188733 tenemos que mirar como garantizamos a todos los chilenos podemos buscar un sistema que no sea una negociaci n un binominalismo
188734 como toda decisi n del senado yo la respeto y no hago m s comentarios sobre eso
188735 uno de los problemas que tiene a mi juicio este sistema es que se politiza este tipo de decisiones y creo que eso genera situaciones que creo que no es lo mejor para el pa s ni para los jueces
188736 recordemos que a principio de gobierno a pesar de que era una propuesta del ex presidente lagos el juez carlos cerda no fue aprobado y tuvimos que buscar un nombre que pudiera contar con la aprobaci n en este caso es lo que vamos a hacer
188737 vamos a buscar la mejor alternativa que pueda contar con el consenso del conjunto de la mayor a de los senadores la mejor alternativa que pueda contar con la votaci n de los senadores

188739 en esta caso como en otros no me doy gustos personal cuando hay un acuerdo entre las fuerzas pol ticas estamos pensando que la corte suprema env a personas que desde el punto de vista de su capacidad jur dica son personas aptas
188740 en este caso si hay una acuerdo que pueda considerar el consenso yo no me doy gustitos personales y yo cumplo la palabra empe ada a mi entender hubo un acuerdo de un grupo importante que permit a cumplir que este nombramiento pudiera ser aprobado por el senado pero eso no se dio

188758 democracy is a poor system of government at best the only thing that can honestly be said in its favor is that it is about eight times as good as any other method the human race has ever tried democracys worst faults is that its leaders are likely to reflect the faults and virtues of their constituents a depressingly low level but what else can you expect
188759 there was so much to grok so little to grok from
188760 its been a very good season for me so far ill work even harder in the second half to keep improving my skills
188761 in the races ill keep using my head so i can keep doing well i have been consistently fast and this is the area where i have fought the most to keep my performance level high with as few drop offs as possible my goal is to win and i would have liked to come out on top in more of the last lap battles weve had this year but it hasnt bothered me or gotten me down it just made me want to work even harder the race always goes the way it wants to go and as a rider you can only train more and get better
188762 my goal is to get in the top ten so i can go to indy
188763 at this race i really need to do my best and be consistent wanting to move up in points and earn your way into the riders cup it doesnt really change your strategy you cant worry about it and be too cautious or it will slow you down you have to run your race and just do your best for mid ohio i have been studying the maps but i really wont have the track down until we get to ride on it i have never been to the track but i hear it has a great atmosphere and that is always fun the circuit looks technical and i did well at barber earlier this year were racing about every other weekend for a while so i hope i can get some momentum
188764 ive gotten two sixths a fourth and a fifth and now i am looking for a podium
188765 it hasnt been too long since laguna so i think i can adapt a little quicker when we get to the track ive been riding supermoto and motocross at home trying to stay in top shape the guys that have been finishing in front of me between qualifying and the race their pace becomes a lot faster they really step it up i think the key is to get up with them on the start and learn few tricks my goal is the podium and once i get it i think it will help my confidence

188773 we are going to nationalize banco de venezuela i make an appeal to grupo santander to come here so that we can start to negotiate
188774 months ago i received the information through intelligence sources that banco de venezuela which had been privatized for years was being sold by its spanish owners that an agreement had been signed between grupo santander and a venezuelan private banker then the venezuelan banker needed the permission of the government to buy a bank this is not a small operation and then i sent a message to the spanish and the venezuelan banker to tell them that the government wanted to buy the bank we want to recover it then the owners said no we dont want to sell it so now i say no i will buy it how much is it we are going to pay for it and we are going to nationalize banco de venezuela
188775 from this moment the media campaign on the part of the spanish and international media is going to start they are going to say that ch vez is an autocrat that ch vez is a tyrant i dont care we are going to nationalize the bank regardless
188776 there is something obscure here because its owners first were desperate to sell and now they are saying they do not want to sell it to the venezuelan state we are going to nationalize it so that it is put at the service of the venezuelan people
188777 we need a bank of that size because this is the banco de venezuela but this bank generates massive profits but these profits are going abroad
188778 profits will not go to one private group they will be invested in socialist social development socialism is stronger every day that passes
188779 its looking like a negative development i dont see why the banking sector needs to be under the purview of the public sector
188780 the private sector does a much more efficient job of running that type of business

188789 mimetex is an entirely separate little program that doesnt use tex or its fonts in any way
188790 it looks like we have this continued pattern where more people are coming into the labor market looking for work
188791 for any given household people who werent at work before are now working to try to make up the gap in income so you had a 213 000 rise in the labor force
188792 its a bit of a mixed bag on the margin its probably a little better than what the markets had feared going into it but its not a slam dunk positive by any means
188793 were still in this limbo the fed cant ease the fed cant hike
188794 wall street breathed a sigh of relief because the employment news was bad but not terrible
188795 were on a roller coaster right now but people are afraid of a crash this report reassures us that the employment situation is bad but not about to careen out of control and crash the job market wont get better for a while recessions dont tend to be as dramatic because the manufacturing base has gone offshore so you dont get those massive layoffs in manufacturing the flip side is youre not going to have the dramatic upticks either these shifts tend to be prolonged
188796 its sort of a mixed bag the payroll numbers were a little bit better than expected they were only down 51 000 but on the other hand the unemployment rate shot up to 5 7 percent which is worse than anticipated
188797 we were little surprised last month because the labor force participation rate dropped and i think what this indicates that was a bit of a fluke and it came back this time
188798 its a high number were above the historical average slightly by itself the actual level is not that big a deal but its up 1 3 points from where it was at the bottom weve never had that big an increase where it wasnt called a recession
188799 my opinion remains the same were in a recession its going to be a mild recession one but a long one
188800 people really thought the non farm payrolls number was going to be bad number youre bouncing back in equity futures from the fact that the number wasnt as bad
188801 so not only was the latest number 20 25 000 better than expected but the prior two months were revised up so its not a good number but its not as bad as expected
188802 were pretty close to expectations the market was bracing itself for an ugly number the dollar rallied on the data because we didnt get a steep decline in payrolls as had been forecasted for the dollar it will be technical for the rest of the day if 1 5518 for eur usd is broken well probably see further strength in the u s dollar
188803 this is exactly in line with the weak u s economy while we arent seeing a loss of 200 000 or 300 000 in layoffs we never really saw corporations go on a hiring binge either we are clearly in a growth recession and my fear is that we are in a mild but longer recession than the one we experienced in 2001 2002 this figure might not be as weak as expected but it is still painful i dont think this will change anyones perceptions on slow economic growth
188804 on balance its a favorable report it has to be perceived as better than expected because of the payroll number which is not as dire as feared
188805 a higher jobless rate is worrisome from a worker perspective but from the fed perspective this should assuage inflation concerns because a higher unemployment rate clamps down upward pressure on compensation
188806 clearly its a pretty weak labor market payrolls are more than weak enough to keep the unemployment rate going up and theres no sign of a turnaround for now the fed is hold but we still think the next move is down not up if unemployment keeps going up i think ultimately therell be pressure for them to ease again
188807 based on the headlines it is not as discouraging as we thought it would be it is the smallest job loss in a few months anyway job losses in manufacturing were significant but not as large as i feared they might be overall the report looks to be broadly consistent with other data that show the economy quite soft basically stalled not growing very much but not contracting very much either
188808 the job losses are not dramatic but they show that the economy is very close to recession and that problems in the labor market are probably going to be a concern to consumers
188809 payroll employment fell for the seventh consecutive month showing that companies are still trimming their workforce the unemployment rate rose to 5 7 percent partly because more people are looking for jobs and its a difficult job market

188864 this is the busiest time for the campaign and we appreciate your willingness to allow us to produce these records after the campaign activities have ceased
188865 that date may be significant to those you represent but it is not relevant to this investigation
188866 others continue to provide documents pursuant to our requests and there is no justifiable reason why your client cant as well moreover i do not intend to interject politics into this investigation by stalling our progress until the election is past

188896 theres a 600 million shortfall that the governor through some modest unilateral actions has already resolved this whole exercise is about david paterson becoming governor this is his coming out so to speak and hes chosen to come out as the governor who cut spending and imposes discipline on a profligate legislature and thats not the governor we want him to be
188897 i hated the job the whole time i was there
188898 but the only reason i stayed was because i was worried about the visa situation
188899 like those doctors or engineers that come over from india or pakistan or africa and they have to be cab drivers almost
188900 when i told her she was like oh my god
188901 she doesnt want her grandkids being brainwashed into the american way of life
188902 are the best and brightest of the canadian human resource pool
188903 mit sicherheit h tte es uns auch besser treffen k nnen
188904 madrid ist in der letzten saison vierter in der spanischen liga geworden und verf gt ber exzellente spieler wir werden sie jetzt sehr genau beobachten und uns perfekt auf die spiele einstellen im hinspiel m ssen wir uns dann schon eine gute ausgangsposition f r das r ckspiel in spanien verschaffen
188905 in dieser runde h tte es eh kein leichtes spiel gegeben daf r ist das niveau bei allen teilnehmern zu hoch wir haben aber schon in der letzten saison in der champions league gezeigt was wir leisten k nnen und brauchen uns nicht zu verstecken ich freue mich auf dieses besondere spiel und denke dass es auch f r unsere fans ein erster saisonh hepunkt wird
188906 madrid war sicherlich der schwerste gegner den wir bekommen konnten aber sie h tten sich wahrscheinlich auch einen anderen gew nscht in dieser partie sehe ich jetzt keinen favoriten und glaube die chancen stehen 50 50
188907 wir sind eine wachsende mannschaft die immer besser wird dazu haben wir einige sehr gute spieler verpflichtet
188908 a great idea thats born at the university of michigan that we want to turn into a good business the venture capitalists on coasts will come knocking and say we want you to move we want to keep those businesses here
188909 both of those are obviously well above the 8 percent rate of return which is sort of the watermark youre looking for
188910 the expectation is that the potential rates of return are generally speaking very good
188911 but were starting to build momentum and this is another great tool that we can use to bring to bear to sell michigan
188912 and with the expertise they have and how can they link us to other opportunities its a great retention tool
188913 with a project this size youre going to have issues to overcome so far weve overcome them and maintained the schedule
188914 the building was designed to create the same atmosphere that you would have in a gym
188915 its going to have a big arena feel in some ways but the seating is pulled really tight so its very intimate and theres not a bad seat in the house
188916 we can take care of every aspect of the student athletes who are coming here its a big time upgrade its particularly great at the southern conference level
188917 so were going to be out there over the next couple months pushing and promoting season tickets and tying to get people involved
188918 as a private club phoenix country club does not discuss internal affairs especially membership issues
188919 the club is a terrific place with a golden opportunity to raise its standing in the community by adopting more modern policies
188920 unfortunately the clubs board has failed to grasp that and is leading the club down a disastrous path i sincerely hope that the membership realizes what is happening and collectively puts a stop to it before it is too late
188921 force those who cannot afford health insurance to buy it punishing those who wont fall in line
188922 punishing families who cant afford health care in the first place
188923 misleading an example of the kind of slim reeds campaigns use to try and win an office
188924 what were saying is exhaust other remedies mr president it is the economic life of americas families and to suggest that drilling offshore is going to make a difference to them paycheck to paycheck now is a frivolous contention
188925 what an anti american anti reality based form of representation
188926 out beyond ideas of right doing and wrong doing there is a field
188927 the best way to escape from your problem is to solve it
188928 it is up to the states to make those decisions he

188930 out beyond ideas of right doing and wrong doing there is a field
188931 re this is what happens when a lefty woman is put in charge constant whining and nothing getting done good job
188932 there is a small group of jewish neoconservatives who unsuccessfully tried to get benjamin netanyahu to attack saddam hussein in the 1990s and then successfully helped provide the intellectual rationale for george bush to do it in 2003 happily these people represent a very small sliver of the jewish population in this country i remain proud of my jewish heritage a strong supporter of israel but i am not willing to grant these ideologues the anonymity they seek i believe there are a small group of jewish neoconservatives who are pushing for war with iran because they believe it is in americas long term interests and because they believe israels existence is at stake they are wrong and recent history tells us they are dangerous they are also bullies and im not going to be intimidated by them
188933 as for his klein use of classic anti semitic canards i am happy to report that the jewish people will long survive joe klein
188934 most jews disagree with their the jewish neocons politics and many jews are disgusted with their behavior
188935 their defiance was so strident and their anger so intense that the rest of the jewish community respectfully stood back and let the new jews take the lead
188936 foreign minister tzipi livni said a few months ago in a series of closed discussions that in her opinion that iranian nuclear weapons do not pose an existential threat to israel livni also criticized the exaggerated use that prime minister ehud olmert is making of the issue of the iranian bomb claiming that he is attempting to rally the public around him by playing on its most basic fears
188937 larry can you be any more of a yankee apologist just look past your yankee myopia and try some objectivity
188938 wow larry youve produced 25 of the comments on this thread and said nothing meaningful thats impressive even for you
188939 after reading all your postings and daily weblog i believe you have truly become the phil pepe of this generation now this is not necessarily a good thing
188940 you blog sucks it reeds as it was written by the queer son of mike lupica and roids clemens i could write a better column by letting a monkey fuk a typewriter i dont need no 181 million dollar team to write a blog fukkk the spankeees
188941 i think his followers have a different sexual preference than most men
188942 im not qualified to write for online media let alone mainstream media
188943 this is a big boost to government efforts to stem rising unemployment in the central luzon region more than 90 of these projects are foreign direct investments from norway canada korea japan malaysia us taiwan and pakistan
188944 leave the matter concerning the validity of the decision to the parties to take whatever steps they may deem appropriate in the usual course of procedure
188945 if he would give up he would lose his chance for an sc seat and the promise of monetary consideration
188946 at that point i was shocked that he had a very low regard for me he was treating me like there was a price on my person i could not describe my feelings i was stunned
188947 i had called mrs clavano about some personal matters it was during that call that i was again shocked to learn that mr de borja had already called her she told me she was also shocked that he had the gall to ask her to convince me to accept the bribe
188948 im just curious how could he even suggest a thing when he should know that the test is not admissible in court
188949 in the end its a full year gain well just wait and see maybe we can do better in the second half
188950 whats happening now is that banks are going to lending and thats better
188951 there is a possibility the national government may sell the shares of san miguel this year
188952 i will announce in two weeks any breakthrough in discussions with representatives of philippine coconut producers federation inc
188953 the proceeds are intended for small farmers and coconut industry the government wants to book the proceeds to the treasury first so it will count as revenues then put in the trust fund for farmers they want the proceeds to booked directly to the treasury fund set up for them kasi duda daw sila na baka gamitin ng because they are wary it will be used by the government for other purposes
188954 i categorically and vehemently deny the allegations of justice jose sabio that i was waiting in the car while he was allegedly meeting with francis de borja on july 1 2008 at the ateneo law school in rockwell mind you i do not have the habit of waiting in the car for anybody except for my wife the allegation is malicious and pure fabrication
188955 francis is a friend but he is not in any way connected with any of the family businesses especially with meralco clearly the matter is between francis and justice sabio it is lamentable that my name was dragged into this
188956 the market was fair today it was surprising actually to see the market going against the trend of the dow jones
188957 bpi contributed the bulk of yesterdays gain the markets performance yesterday was surprising and we may see some consolidation in the market
188958 the market is attempting to break out of its down channel so far the market is succeeding although it would take some time
188959 a grande diferen a que este um lbum feito por uma banda n s temos uma forma o s lida agora que n s realmente trabalhamos duro pra conseguir percebemos que temos que colocar nossos egos de lado e trabalhar na m sica e nas melhores can es que pudermos fazer n o importa quem teve a id ia se ela for boa n s iremos us la colocamos todas as nossas id ias na mesa e escolhemos as melhores para este novo lbum este processo precisa de muita paci ncia e provou que estamos fortes como uma banda e isto porque n s viemos com um lbum que todos ficamos satisfeitos todo mundo p s 100 de si sem pensar em quem mais importante

188961 eu escrevi a maioria das letras dave e nick escreveram algumas tamb m mas acredite em mim eu posso contar uma hist ria para cada m sica no lbum como blackmailer que sobre a ltima gravadora em que estive eles mentiram para mim me roubaram me trapacearam quebraram o acordo feito ent o uma hist ria ver dica a nica coisa que deixei de fora foi o nome do cara que apertou minha m o assim fomos colocando as m sicas em fila o lbum parece seguir uma certa estrada tudo come a com amargura ressentimento e depois de algum tempo a vontade de voltar a ativa como se voc estivesse em uma situa o dif cil que algu m lhe p s ent o a hora de peg los de volta assim como o lbum progride voc colocado em um trabalho que n o gosta mas faz para sobreviver ent o chegando ao fim as m sicas ganham um pouco mais de peso onde voc percebe que esta a sua vida e voc tem de lutar cada dia para fazer o melhor disto eu espero que as pessoas captem a vibra o do lbum que baseado em minha experi ncia voc sabe depois do ltimo disco as coisas foram realmente ruins e atualmente eu tenho de trabalhar em uma f brica para ganhar a vida n o tenho dinheiro porque eu gastei tudo na banda mas a gravadora me quebrou eu trabalhei em um armaz m e esta experi ncia me lembrou de quando comecei waiting for my life to begin sobre esta poca quando eu estava trabalhando e pensando quando eu poderia estar pronto para entrar numa banda e come ar a cantar novamente eu estava olhando as pessoas ao meu redor que estavam fazendo o mesmo trabalho por quase 20 anos e pensei foda se eu tenho sido totalmente aben oado com as coisas que tenho feito ent o hora de seguir em frente voc sabe eu tenho sido aben oado com alguns f s leais que t m me apoiado mesmo durante tempos sombrios
188962 foi absolutamente incr vel ele um cara muito talentoso o disco estava em uma condi o terr vel com muitos problemas t cnicos e n s fomos at o limite sem saber o que fazer ent o telefonamos para jase pedindo por sua ajuda demos ele tudo e depois de um dia tudo estava de volta ao seu lugar ele fez um magn fico trabalho para n s e eu realmente buscarei trabalhar com ele novamente no futuro
188963 n o n o pensamos entretanto fizemos uma reuni o nos palcos no ltimo natal e foi muito divertido estamos abrindo caminhos se algo bom vier como uma turn no jap o ent o provavelmente faremos isto durar enquanto n o interferir com nada ningu m tem planos e estamos todos em dire es musicais diferentes mas eu n o posso descartar isso nos anos que vir o agora o mais importante para mim a banda blaze

188983 as a result this may turn out to be a longer recession than were used to
188984 without the stimulus package this would have been a very standard u shaped recession

188991 all about the beat why hip hop cant save black america
188992 of course obama and his people have to condemn the rap because it does say some vulgar things
188993 if youre running for president youre supposed to be an upstanding individual
188994 theyre thinking an obama who knows how to play the game is still better for me than a mccain
188995 there are a ton of people who clearly are looking for obama to denounce this in order to continue to view him as credible
188996 he for political purposes has to separate himself from anything controversially black
188997 im not aware of hip hop music affecting any election so far and i dont think that this is going to be one either
188998 theres no doubt that hip hop culture moves our young people powerfully and some of it is not just a reflection of reality
188999 it also creates reality i think that if all our kids see is a glorification of materialism and bling and casual sex and kids are never seeing themselves reflected as hitting the books and being responsible and delaying gratification then they are getting an unrealistic picture of what the world is like
189000 lets get free strategies for organizing the hip hop voting bloc

189047 without shedding of blood there is no remission or forgiveness of sin
189048 thus saith yahweh judgement first starts at my house with my people who calls themselves by my name not with the world and unbelievers
189049 turn your laughter into mourning and your joy into sorrow saith yahweh
189050 do not prophesy to us right things don t preach to us about sin in our lives speak to us smooth things prophesy deceits
189051 may god grant you the ability to forgive us and may we be brothers and sisters again
189052 son of man your people are whispering behind your back they talk about you in their houses and whisper about you at the doors saying come on lets have some fun lets go hear the prophet tell us what the lord is saying so they come pretending to be sincere and sit before you listening but they have no intention of doing what i tell them they express love with their mouths but their hearts seek only after money you are very entertaining to them like someone who sings love songs with a beautiful voice or plays fine music on an instrument they hear what you say but they dont do it but when all these terrible things happen to them as they certainly will then they will know a prophet has been among them
189053 even the denominational and doctrinal differences are a symptom of the problem not the root effect not the cause the root and cause is a proud and stubborn heart
189054 judgement first starts at my house the house of god not with the world and unbelievers
189055 you cannot serve god and mammon either you will love the one and hate the other
189056 your faith can create any kind of future you want
189057 give a dollar and you will get a hundredfold in return
189058 though he was rich yet for your sake he became poor that you through his poverty might become rich
189059 thus saith yahweh believers are going through the tribulation period
189060 god will snatch out believers they won t go through god s judgement
189061 he did not select us to condemn us but that we might obtain his salvation
189062 for the sake of the elect chosen ones those days will be shortened
189063 i will gather my elect from the 4 corners of the earth and of heaven
189064 when you say i am a christian you are saying i am messiah in hebrew i am a little messiah walking earth
189065 are you ready for some real revelation knowledge you are god
189066 though we are not almighty god himself nevertheless we are now divine
189067 pray to yourself because im in your self and youre in myself we are one spirit saith the lord
189068 and i say this with all respect so that it dont upset you too bad but i say it anyway
189069 don t be disturbed when people put you down and speak harshly and roughly of you they spoke that way of me should they not speak that way of you the more you get to be like me the more they re going to think that way of you they crucified me for claiming that i was god but i didn t claim i was god i just claimed i walked with him and that he was in me hallelujah
189070 adam was as much like god as you can get just the same as jesus when he came to earth adam in the garden of eden was god manifested in the flesh
189071 you dont have a god in you you are one

189073 faith is a force and words are containers of that force
189074 you re not looking at morris cerullo you re looking at god you re looking at jesus
189075 god created the world by the power of his word we can create the world around us by the power of our words
189076 every man who has been born again is an incarnation and christianity is a miracle the believer is as much an incarnation as was jesus of nazareth
189077 we re just fine the way we are yahweh leave us alone
189078 beware of when people speak well of you as their fathers did to the false prophets
189079 for they prophesy a vision of their own heart saith yahweh i didn t command them i didn t authorize them or send them they presume to speak for me in my name
189080 let 2 or 3 of the prophets speak and the rest judge
189081 to discern to decide if it s from god to scrutinize
189082 don t believe every spirit brethern but test the spirits whether they are from god or not
189083 many will say to me on that day lord lord didn t we prophesy in your name drive out demons and do many wonderful things i will say to them depart from me you doers of evil and iniquity i never knew you
189084 how dare you question me i m a prophet of god
189085 i wish you all spoke with tongues but even more that you prophesy
189086 how is it then brethern whenever you come together everyone of you has a psalm has a doctrine has a tongue has a revelation has an interpretation let all things be done for edification
189087 thus saith yahweh 2 or 3 people are not to monopolize the spiritual gifts the power of god or the service too many of these preachers are on an ego trip
189088 for now we see in a mirror dimly but then face to face now i know in part but then i shall know just as i am known
189089 we do not want disease we want to be gods
189090 i want you to hear what jesus said about himself god was in christ wasn t he an incarnation god is in you an incarnation if you were born again you are incarnate
189091 for god s purpose through jesus christ is to deify the nature of men and thus forever make them like unto thus he becomes the son of god a saviour and redeemer forever
189092 she arose from her chair her eyes quite shut and came in my direction i got up and moved to my chair she walked right around and came to me she slipped her fingers down gave me a little chuck just like my late wife would have done and said jack my jack god is with you all the time go right on but my baby my teddy i am so lonesome for him but you pray so hard so hard you pray so hard
189093 listen it is not dragging spirits up and isn t dragging some spirits down there is nothing about calling spirits down from god in the word only about calling them out of depths
189094 i rose from that chair with one of the most tremendous passions in my nature one of the most terrible conditions of sensuousness in me
189095 it is not necessary for the soul desiring christ s touch or blessing to have any knowledge of the scientific process by which healing or salvation is accomplished
189096 if the tree is evil the frut will also be evil
189097 lord lord did we not prophesy in your name drive out demons in your name and do many wonderful miraculous signs in your name i will say to them depart from me you doers of evil and inequity
189098 if a person wants to give an exhortation from their soul or say something to encourage people that s fine just don t say thus saith the lord because it s not a prophecy from me an exhortation from a person s soul or feelings is not a prophecy from me god that s what false prophets do prophesy their own personal thoughts feelings and opinions
189099 shall we only accept good things from yahweh shall we only accept good things from yahweh positive feel good prophecies and not the other his discipline correction even rebuke if and when necessary heb 12 5 11 rev 3 14 21 shall we only accept good things from yahweh
189100 i don t like the prophecy therefore it s not from god
189101 the message upsets me therefore it s not from god
189102 yes there is a distinction the biggest difference between the gift of prophecy someone who gives prophecies from time to time in the church and the ministry office of prophet is the office of prophet is a full time position of authority a full time position of leadership in the body of christ
189103 the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets
189104 remember people that prophesy are in control of their spirit and can wait their turn
189105 son of man preach to the preachers the shepherds of my people saying thus saith yahweh so many of them have the sin of pride in their hearts they love being in authority they love being the authority they have forgotten i put them in authority to serve others
189106 i m in charge here and what i say goes
189107 you know that in this world kings are tyrants and officials lord over the people flaunt their position and authority and act as tyrants beneath them but among you it should be quite different whoever desires to become great among you let him be your servant and whoever wants to be first have first place of honor let him be your slave just as the son of man didn t come to be served but to serve and give his life as a ransom for many
189108 my father s house will be called a house of prayer but you have turned it into a den of thieves
189109 dont be disturbed when people put you down and speak harshly and roughly of you they spoke that way of me should they not speak that way of you the more you get to be like me the more theyre going to think that way of you they crucified me for claiming that i was god but i didnt claim i was god i just claimed i walked with him and that he was in me hallelujah
189110 the end is not yet it s the begining of sorrows birth pangs
189111 thus saith yahweh a word for all believers in this country u s a and other developed countries believers are in for a rude awakening god is going to allow trials tribulations hardships difficulties pain and persecution to force his born again children to grow up already
189112 we re not perfect perhaps yahweh but we re fine the way we are leave us alone
189113 but if all prophesy and an unbeliever walks in the secrets of their heart are laid bare and they will be convicted by all and judged by all and he will say god is really among you
189114 and the peace of god will guard or rule your hearts
189115 those who are led by the ruach elohim spirit of god are sons of god
189116 don t be surprised by the fiery trials you are going through as something strange is happening
189117 originally a pagan festival in honor of the goddess of spring eastre held in april
189118 the word easter is of saxon origin eastra the goddess of spring in whose honor sacrifices were offered about passover time each year
189119 i haven t come to destroy the torah law but to fulfill it
189120 no prophecy of scripture that is to say scripture which is prophetic by nature i e speaking for god is open to someone s personal ideas or opinions
189121 if that s true and i didn t say that it is true but if it were true you can interpret the bible any way you want you might as well throw that bible in the garbage because it would be worthless
189122 originally a pagan festival in honor of the goddess of spring eastre held in april
189123 the word easter is of saxon origin eastra the goddess of spring in whose honor sacrifices were offered about passover time each year
189124 i am the lord your god you will not have any other gods besides me
189125 yahweh has sent me to you this is my name forevermore a memorial for all generations
189126 i will bless those who bless you and curse those who curse you
189127 how to be aware of and cooperate with your angels
189128 don t seek the gifts gifts of the spirit as and end in themslves but seek the giver of the gifts jesus
189129 as has been their hallmark this congress bush mccain republicans have once again run away from an important debate failing to back up their words with action

189158 if cannabis causes psychosis in and of itself then one would expect that any increase in the rates of cannabis use would be associated with increased rates of psychosis however in some areas where cannabis use has clearly increased e g australia there has not been a commensurate increase in the rate of psychotic disorders further one might also expect that if the age of initiation of cannabis use decreases there should also be a decrease in the age of onset of psychotic disorders we are unaware of such evidence

189188 a nuclear iran is unacceptable not only to israel but to the united states
189189 also made it clear to him that on the iranian threat there is no dissension in israel this is a national attitude
189190 the clocks and centrifuges are clicking and spinning and not only is time of the essence but the order of things is as well should one fail to neutralize that iranian threat now it would undercut anything that would be achieved with the palestinians syria or lebanon
189191 if you follow that logic the current efforts to move on the palestinian issue are pathetic because they would not be worth the paper theyre written on if iran is not contained if iran became nuclear it would mean the victory of the militants in hamas and hezbollah and undercut the moderates
189192 netanyahu reacted by saying that what is essential here are not means but the ends they are in agreement about the overall objective then netanyahu added his considered judgment that the more credible the military option the more likely it is that diplomacy with sanction will succeed
189193 were in complete agreement on the goal of preventing iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon they certainly agreed that the iran threat is the paramount concern and that a nuclear bomb is unacceptable to both countries
189194 i would say that among those within the government the one issue on which there was absolute unanimity was iran
189195 basically made it very clear that this was a critical national security interest of the united states

189214 okay hopefully thisll work everywhere but im not sure its the direct recording of the news bulletin and the actual interview has been edited a bit theres a bit of rupert missing but here you can see him hopefully
189215 all i can say is that there s no happy ending and no one gets the girl
189216 you know what i think when rupert says that no one gets the girl in the end they all die the end
189217 hey what if the girl gets killed and the guys end up with each other
189218 oh come on dont leave me with her again come back jacob
189219 i needed work done and so many of these issues do come down to price
189220 it is yet to be seen if there is a significant difference in cost and if it will allow poor people to access dental hygiene service
189221 so many people are not getting their teeth cleaned on a regular basis and what are the barriers
189222 cost convenience and the fact that you have people who do not want to see the dentist
189223 if i was practising dentistry right now i dont think id lobby the government and say this isnt good for the public when in fact it is going on and hygienists are practising on their own when dentists are playing golf on wednesdays and fridays
189224 do i think the patient is better cared for by going to two different places to have their work done

189246 no updates during july sorry for that we actually had 3 vocal recording session during july and we got 6 7 out of 10 songs recorded including the cover jarnos vocals sound excellent raw and broken this is the way i like them we are recording the vocals in barrow studios which is actually my home i did the remake of lacrimae mundi on my home studio as well this time i have my own room for computer and listening and jarno is singing in the bedroom the sound is actually quite good we are using r de nt 1a mic its connected to presonus fp10 and that is firewired to my laptop recording everything on 24 bits as i said above jarno is actually singing in my bedroom its still filled with stuff because of the renovation around the house and for this reason the room sounds actually quite nice for vocal recording not echoing not totally dead jarno seems fine with the room and listening we have been recording the main vocals and some of the backing vocals during the sessions so far we are going to listen through the songs and decide where we should have more vocals and what kind of backing is needed the idea is to have one track for the main vocal throughout the whole song and then add backing vocals if needed this is just to have the vocal track as raw and live like as possible and of course this will help the mixing process as well jarno went back to south africa but hell move back to finland at the end of august during august i will sort through the vocal tracks and record the guitars ville will probably record some most of the basses on the album and eve from mygrain will be my helping hand with the synths at the moment it seems that we are not going to use that much synths for this album but this can of course change if eve will blow my mind with ideas hahah so now guitars bass synths and jarnos missing vocals in september the album should be ready for mixing by the end of september damn finally

189260 this secret regulation is an attempt by the bush administration and the business community to fundamentally weaken the scientific process for enacting new regulations that protect american workers
189261 for nearly eight years this administration has consistently failed to respond in a meaningful way to the real health and safety threats workers face while on the job but now they will stop at nothing to rush through a secret rule that will tie the hands of health and safety experts when responding to our nations critical health and safety threats
189262 its outrageous that after spending seven and a half years refusing to respond to known workplace hazards the bush administration is now rushing to make it more difficult to protect workers from these dangers its just the latest example of the bush administrations anti worker anti science bias americas working men and women deserve far better
189263 congress will not stand for any backdoor effort by the political appointees to further cripple our nations ability to respond to vital health and safety concerns
189264 this entire effort is the product of a flawed politicized process that has failed to properly consider the views of experts or the consequences for workplace health

189299 a cualquier cambio que registre el clima del planeta en el tiempo ya sea debido a causas naturales o como resultado de la actividad humana
189300 organizan de tal modo que promuevan la idea de que el cambio clim tico es causado por el aumento de gases de efecto invernadero
189301 observaciones sobre la evoluci n real del clima son o bien ocultas o bien
189302 no son predicciones del futuro y no deben utilizarse como tales

189656 instead of simply utilizing nuclear weapons as a means of deterrence they the us will start manufacturing bombs and other devices of mass destruction for the purpose of actually using them and the most important point i believe is that they clearly stated their intention to use those weapons in combat
189657 overwheening even crazy and criminal by what it implies and one that did not come out of president bush juniors head to be implemented by an extreme right junta seizing power through dubious elections
189658 it is the project which the ruling class of the united states has unceasingly nurtured since 1945 even though its implementation evidently passed through ups and downs encountered a few vicissitudes and was here and there checked and could be not be pursued with the consistency and violence that this implied in certain conjunctural moments like that following the disintegration of the soviet union
189659 the objective of us global policy is not just power for its own sake but the
189660 it is notably in the middle east and surrounding the question of palestine that the united states has systematically instituted impunity in the face of violations of international law
189661 when i speak before american university students i say this to them if i were to write a book called the american empire for dummies page one would say dont ever look for the moral factor us foreign policy has no moral factor built into its dna clear your mind of that baggage which only gets in the way of seeing beyond the clich s and the platitudes they feed us

189663 such a felt sense of political responsibility for empires actions by its citizens is dependent on viewing oneself not as an innocent or impotent bystander but rather as an implicated agent
189664 do have a responsibility to act to resist empire this is based on an analysis of the impunity of empire for it is the idea that there is a nonreciprocal right of empire to run roughshod over everyone else in the name of spreading its own values and its own conception of security globally one of the essential hallmarks of empires law that must be contested
189665 ethically motivated and informed global action has no adequately global instruments
189666 what the american empire fears and i think rightly is that such strategies may contribute to our capacities to become the strong my claim is that such politically inspired attempts litigating against american empire under international humanitarian law may contribute to the goals of cultivating a sense of poitical responsibility while both depending on political action for their broad effectivity and contributing to further political action

189712 it is well established that an erisa fiduciary may delegate its fiduciary responsibilities to either another named fiduciary or a third party if the plan establishes procedures for such delegation

189714 other courts of appeal have interpreted sereboff to allow a plan fiduciary to pursue a claim to recover overpayments even when the funds have been dissipated by the beneficiary

189719 when as here the defendants never possessed the funds in question and thus were not unjustly enriched
189720 appropriate to allow the industry to inform patients directly by any other means
189721 information produced by pharmaceutical industry is usually not objective and neutral therefore even with the proposed quality criteria and supervision mechanisms it would be difficult to prevent advertising of prescription medicines to the public this in turn will increase unnecessary consumption of prescription medicines and hamper with drug cost containment efforts
189722 however it should be absolutely clear that certain information must remain exempted from this categorisation and thus also not fall under a system of
189723 would be appropriate ways for the industry to communicate information on specific prescription medicines
189724 the prescribing doctor is a fundamental supplier of information to the patient within the context of the patient doctor meeting
189725 does not think it appropriate to allow the industry to inform patients directly by any other means
189726 interfere with the freedom for doctors to make prescribing decisions based on clinical judgement
189727 a means to assist the industry in creating more direct contacts with patients
189728 opens the door to widespread abuse of what is already a very unclear distinction between what is information and what is advertising
189729 in the real world it would be difficult to see what motivation industry had to provide information if it wasnt to promote its products in the competitive pharmaceuticals market companies are driven to champion their own medicines conflict of interest therefore prevents them from providing the comparative yet unbiased information that patients need to make an informed decision about their medication
189730 deep concern over the lack of transparency and representation in the role and set up of the pharmaceutical forum whose conclusions have been both taken up as legitimate in the present legal framework as well as used as reference criteria

189749 should be lowered forever from the staff atop south carolinas capitol
189750 i had promised to tell the truth no matter what

189754 john mccain is far and away the most emotional politician i have ever met
189755 people dont understand that so they keep talking about his temperament his temper he reacts emotionally therefore unpredictably
189756 there is no such thing as compromise you either win or you lose
189757 we lost in vietnam because we lost the will to fight because we did not understand the nature of the war we were fighting and because we limited the tools at our disposal
189758 all i can say is they the iraqis are establishing the rule of law theyre going to be having elections and i think theyre becoming an effective government which is what our strategy was thanks to the genius of a guy named david petraeus

189761 what he really enjoys although the witnesses seldom do is to put opposing witnesses on the same panel and sit back and watch them fight and see who has the best argument

189769 i dont know if it will or not but i think youve got to have people who you think would interpret the constitution of the united states most accurately
189770 whether that means that certain decisions go for or against you then i think we just have to obviously you cant have litmus tests
189771 many contemporary conservatives have let their healthy skepticism about government sink into something unhealthy an embittered loathing of the federal government
189772 must not shrink from its duty to be the highest expression of the national will and the last bulwark against all assaults on our founding ideals
189773 unfettered capitalism leads to corruption we are seeing that with the subprime lending crisis
189774 may not be decisive for the average voter right now given our economic troubles but its knowledge they can store in the back of their minds for when they go into the polling place later

189850 we now expect that the pretax return on sales for the year to be at least 4
189851 if however the situation on the car markets particularly for preowned cars does not ease over the course of 2008 there is a risk that this could have a negative impact on bmw groups earnings for the year

189854 for smalls that we deliver currently there is a two inch minimum any potatoes that are below that are not payable

189856 we wanted to make sure the locals here in ottawa had an opportunity to buy ontario rather than buying california or chile or china
189857 this is definitely still local but its just a different distance
189858 it does go against the element of being a local market

189869 this decision was made in part because of the increased activity that will arise due to the agreement made by the itf in october with the atp to take over management of drug testing at atpsanctioned events from the start of 2006 when we considered how best to structure the anti doping department we felt that stuarts scientific and academic background made him the ideal choice during his tenure we have noted his achievements that have helped to make the itf technical department and laboratory the gold standard in this area he has also contributed through his work with the itf technical commission and sport science amp medicine commission we expect stuarts leadership to help us greatly in the fight against doping in tennis
