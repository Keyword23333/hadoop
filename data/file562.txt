5620000 he is an intelligent boy and that is always a very good ingredient when you are intelligent in life and with talent you always have a chance
5620001 for me he is a player who has a good engine good technique and vision he can play the final ball which we like here he has the technical level to go into any combination and is very mobile
5620002 we believe he has the ingredients to fit into our game
5620003 he can replace alex hleb in the build up of the game in the creation of the chances and he is very versatile he is also very young the same age as
5620004 basically we balance the budget in the way we run the club
5620005 i have the money available to buy the players but we go into the competition with that target i think every manager should do this
5620006 we have gone three or four years into a different policy of bringing on our own players which we have to see through
5620007 but i am convinced we have opted for stability with young players who have spirit of our game the spirit of our club
5620008 i think you always want to buy the players at the right price
5620009 when you want to move a club forward as i think i have done here in the last 10 years some investment is needed not only to buy players but to spot players when they are not necessarily stars the quality of a manager is as well to develop players
5620010 for example when we bought adebayor who was thinking that he is a great player we bought him for what you can call at the time a reasonable price
5620011 but it is not necessarily linked with the price of the players it is linked with the how well the player develops how good he becomes and then you assess the situation of the player once he plays
5620012 manchester united are in the 20 30 million bracket of the market chelsea are in an unlimited bracket and we have to be in our own bracket reasonable but shrewd
5620013 of course i have made mistakes there are players i should have done but none at 30m
5620014 with ribery we had top class players in that position rosicky and hleb
5620015 und sind nun immerhin ohne niederlage durch die starke gruppe gekommen
5620016 das ist eine chefausbildung die hier l uft er hat mein vollstes vertrauen und wird sich sehr gut entwickeln

5620020 the italian olympic committee bought economy class plane tickets for all the athletes without any disparity between the various sports
5620021 if then some individual national federation like the soccer federation has chosen to increase the budget for a change in class it is a decision which has nothing to do with us

5620044 well see if they can turn their attention to governance and get a handle on their problems they have been using the musharraf thing as an excuse for non governance
5620045 this is really the moment of truth for pakistan if this fails it is unclear what will happen
5620046 it will take the new government a full year to work things out on counterterrorism a year to make the mistakes they have to make it is a huge experiment
5620047 the resignation of president pervez musharraf is a step toward moving pakistan onto a more stable political footing pakistan is a critical theatre in countering the threat of al qaeda and violent islamic extremism and i look forward to the government increasing its future cooperation
5620048 he hasnt effectively been leading pakistan for the last six months
5620049 youre truly not going to see any great changes in pakistan with musharrafs resignation with the exception you will start to see greater political infighting among the coalition partners

5620067 the lettings market is booming with many vendors opting to rent their property while sales in the housing market continue to dry up
5620068 in the first six months of 2008 the group succeeded in delivering a strong underlying performance both operationally and financially our mobile operations in hong kong and israel strengthened their 3g market leadership position during the period collectively passing two million 3g customers in indonesia we have seen good sales momentum since the launch of the service in the first half of 2007 and are pleased with the progress to accelerate the network rollout whilst in vietnam we have made progress on the conversion to gsm these steps enhance the groups prospect in those markets positioning us favourably to reap the rewards
5620069 there is evidence of some deterioration in our operating environment as the impact of higher inflation and lower growth affects consumer spending in some markets we are also mindful of the availability of capital and credit in view of the global situation however we are a well capitalised company and during this period would aim to maintain high levels of liquidity to ensure we can meet our operating objectives
5620070 i am so happy foot print opened comfy quality shoes in my neighborhood
5620071 you just want to crawl into their strong arms and bury your face in their chest and just like live there forever
5620072 i stumbled upon this place looking for a late late lunch and found it at progressive grounds cafe
5620073 i stumbled upon this place looking for a late late lunch and found it at progressive grounds cafe
5620074 yes of course definitely i really want to make it here
5620075 at the beginning i wasnt really playing maybe only 10 or 20 minutes at the end of the games but when the coach was replaced i found new confidence and i worked myself into the team
5620076 the beginning was difficult because i have never had that situation before that was the hard part i needed to learn from it and i did it just shows that nobody will just give you something you have to work hard for it
5620077 i worked my way into the team and from there my experience was very good i got new friends too so in general it was a very good time for me
5620078 playing professionally is a new situation one where you play in front of 25 000 people one with pressure from press and fans every single week i am not saying it is better than reserve football here because you learn so much but it is different
5620079 it looks more like the first team and that can prepare you and make you a better player
5620080 it fills me happiness that i am at arsenal a great club and one of the best for young people
5620081 i will keep going with what i do best and going into my third season i have the feeling that i want to make it here
5620082 i havent had a chance to speak with ars ne wenger but i have been training with the physio to improve my fitness levels
5620083 but because we have so many injuries i have to rush him a little bit
5620084 a reasonable target for fabregas is the second leg of the champions league game
5620085 diaby will take four to six weeks as we have said and we dont know about senderos yet
5620086 we have been here before twice in fact but this season is one filled with more optimism in many ways
5620087 looking at it from the outside i suppose survival is the main thing but inside the club there is a real sense of optimism
5620088 he has used villarreal and az alkmaar as potential models of what he would like to install at the hawthorns he sees those two clubs from spain and holland as mould breakers who challenged the big teams in their leagues and did well out of it he wants that at albion and the challenge is there for him i suspect the fans would be happy to survive this season and then build on that the following year but the manager and the chairman have far loftier ambitions
5620089 the transfer dealings have been quite interesting in the fact that the four players brought in so far are not of the attacking nature that albions football might suggest there is a goalkeeper who was rated at 8 million last year but was signed for under 4 million a left back marek cech from porto who is good technically he was signed for around 1 million simply because he was in the last year of his deal gianni zuiverloon from heerenveen he wont play on saturday as he is at the olympics has come in and has pace technical ability and likes to get forward also abdoulaye meite has come into the centre from bolton so they have strengthened and are looking for more players especially in midfield the team needs one body in the holding role and then one to replace zoltan gera further up field if they get the players they want they could have a different team by the first of september
5620090 jonathon greening might be a very unspectacular player but he has really grown in the last year he was given much more responsibility as captain and completely transformed himself not into a midfield general but into a player who can dictate play from midfield he orchestrated a lot of goals from there and one game last season saw neil warnock claim that you needed two players to man mark greening he had that effect on the team last season
5620091 the team are better prepared than they were before in the fact they have players that have played in the premier league people like james morrison ishmael miller jonathan greening paul robinson so they do have a nucleus in the team and they are trying to bring more in as we speak the albion team that we eventually see after the transfer window closes will probably be different to the one we see at emirates on saturday
5620092 if i tell you that west brom conceded more goals last season than relegated leicester then that gives its own indications about where they need strengthening in my opinion i feel the spine of the team is a bit weak they are perhaps a body short of doing the dirty part of midfield work the ball winning side of things then of course there is a huge void left by kevin phillips replacing a player that scores 25 goals albeit at a lower level takes some doing having said all that they are getting there
5620093 mowbray has gone with five in midfield pretty much all of pre season and albion i would say were at their best playing that last season
5620094 when folks have a chance to move on they move on
5620095 teachers pay more attention to people messing around than people who want to learn
5620096 the only way to make money is selling dope on the corner
5620097 it gives a really powerful message that if youre not in school were going to your home
5620098 most of the time we find dropouts not working and not happy with life
5620099 i really dig this spot because it reminds me of that little market i used to go to as a kid run by a family small enough to have really
5620100 i go here every christmas eve with my parents what a cliche because this is some of the best chinese food in the city
5620101 ok we also didnt get dessert they said it would take 10 more minutes the tables around us never got dessert either they left in frustration like us
5620102 i have to take you to a new dim sum restaurant that doesnt have a chinese name
5620103 um yeah we dont have pear anymore but we do have sparkling blueberry instead ok
5620104 yeah so we dont have any sparkling drinks so i brought you what you really wanted in the 1st place which is this blackberry lemonade

5620113 the beta sdk that were releasing today is the first big step on the sdks road to compatibility with 1 0
5620114 since this is a beta release applications developed with it may not quite be compatible with devices running the final android 1 0 however the apis are now pretty stable and we dont expect any major changes
5620115 since were now moving quickly toward 1 0 it may also help to know which direction were headed to help out weve also prepared a this will be a living document and well keep it up to date as the android landscape evolves currently it covers the next few months roughly through the end of the year and a bit into next year well update it with additional detail as we are able to but even right now it can help give you a picture of how things will play out as the first phones draw near enough of that though youre probably wondering whats actually new in the sdk well you should read the api delta report for all the details but here are a few highlights first and most obviously the new home screen is included along with a ton of ui changes for 1 0 some new applications are included an alarm clock calculator camera music player picture viewer and messaging for sms mms conversations several new development tools were added such as a graphical preview for xml layouts for users of eclipse and a tool for constructing 9 patch images since weve got a new home screen application now we thought the now obsolete version from the m5 early look sdk might be helpful to developers so its source is included as a sample a number of new apis are fleshed out and improved and others are now close to their final forms for 1 0 tons of bugs were fixed of course if you had problems with the mediaplayer try it now there are a lot of changes the ones in the list above are just my personal favorites so you should check out the links above for the full story not all the changes are additions though im sorry to say that we had to remove a few things such as the gtalkservice for security reasons and the bluetooth api theres a bit more detail in the links above and well follow up on those in particular here in this blog to give you the scoop in fact weve got a little list of topics we want to talk about here so stay tuned

5620134 if people have that type of attitude there its stupid
5620135 everybody has issues and makes mistakes or has things to deal with its about turning the page and moving forward and concentrating on whats in front of you rather than concentrating on whats behind you

5620137 we successfully lured the calf about a kilometre out to sea probably the first time thats been done using a yacht as a surrogate mother
5620138 later we saw whales a bit further offshore and there was a slender chance it may have linked up with them but this morning we have got reports that it has returned to the western shores of pittwater
5620139 while its moving quite freely at the moment its condition would be expected to deteriorate over the next three days
5620140 weve consistently said it was a slim chance that it might link up with its mother or other whales but the reality is that in the wild for various reasons mothers sometimes reject their young
5620141 looking at its behaviour the way it was nuzzling up to yachts would indicate it was primarily still suckling
5620142 it really was trying to suckle just below the waterline and against the keel with its head engaged against the boat

5620148 over the long run fuel prices do have an effect a longer term process of adaption is set off
5620149 it is possible that the recent oil price increases have set off such a process and that if oil prices remain on an upward trajectory the adaption process may still have a long way to run
5620150 i dont think i played a game healthy last season i was at about 50 or 60 at best
5620151 when i had another scan on the knee this summer it had not improved so i came back early to try to fix it at the beginning of pre season
5620152 i am not going to set a timetable but i am close
5620153 i am working on my fitness every day and while i have not joined in with the lads yet hopefully it will happen this week
5620154 whether i am fit for portsmouth or the match after that the most important thing is i am healthy for the rest of the season
5620155 i know how much i better i can get being around the players and coaching staff here
5620156 it is an issue of significant magnitude and it does need proper assessment and all governments working together to minimise the risks and ensure there is as little damage as possible
5620157 this really is very early work and many more factors need to be taken into account before we have concrete projections
5620158 it is going to be a negative story leading to damage of assets and loss of value
5620159 the evidence over the past 12 to 18 months suggests that we have underestimated how fast this aspect of the earths system can change

5620161 in the 21st century a sea level rise of at least 0 5 metres is a certainty a rise of 1 to 1 5 metres is more likely while a rise of up to four metres this century is possible

5620172 what is the value of eight golds in beijing before a prime time audience in the u s
5620173 id say 100 million over the course of his lifetime
5620174 one gold medal is amazing two is well incredible three practically unbelievable but eight eight gold medals thats thats well well were going to need some new adjectives for whatever that is congratulations michael
5620175 we continue to evaluate post beijing activities that will allow us to reinforce our relationship with michael
5620176 its huge its the opportunity that no startup generally gets
5620177 with opportunity obviously theres a lot of responsibility for us to take advantage of it properly and do it in a way that not only benefits the company but also benefits michael
5620178 we are currently evaluating opportunities to build upon this excitement however a final determination about our future plans has not yet been made
5620179 is he funny is he warm is he interesting does he say things that make you want to listen more or is he the great athlete who is pleased to be here and hes done its going to be interesting

5620186 the afghan national army is saying that anytime we get close to them they detonate themselves
5620187 it an alleged threat and it is not true the government of sudan is a serious government and it is totally committed to its obligations especially when it comes to agreement signed with other organizations and especially the united nations and the african union im not aware of any threat that has been towards to the united nations regarding their very existence in the sudan if the icc has and the judges have confirmed the indictment of the president
5620188 i would rather say that the government is totally committed to its obligations and we have never threatened the united nations peacekeeping force here in sudan whether in darfur or in the south
5620189 in fact they usually do that not only in sudan but everywhere just in case because it happens that when the icc announced its indictment of the president of sudan some of the un peacekeepers here have been relocated outside of the sudan in case anything might happen and this proves just a precautionary measure and because nothing happened and things are going normal in sudan and now those are taken away from sudan the peacekeepers have been flown back to sudan
5620190 we are coming here to submit a letter to the british government asking them to return thaksin to receive justice in thailand
5620191 thaksin fled the indictment to london and is planning to seek asylum in britain
5620192 if thaksin is not brought back to face the charges against him in thai courts it will further contribute to the political and democratic deadlock
5620193 extradition requests are decided in strict accordance with the law
5620194 thaksin is not a political refugee but a criminal evading an arrest warrant
5620195 it just feels fantastic to come in with a medal this time and the fact that its gold is just amazing
5620196 i always knew it was going to be a bit of an up and down regatta i didnt start great in the first race but bounced straight back and then from there i was always within reaching distance and sailed a superb day yesterday to give myself the cushion i needed for today
5620197 i think that if the winds here had been a little bit stronger and the racing had been normal then i would have just sailed my race because i would have been more confident that i wasnt going to lose
5620198 but because the wind was so light and so random the only way to guarantee winning was to do what i did
5620199 my heart feels for him i feel sorry for him but at the end of the day you have to do whats best for you
5620200 maybe tomorrow i might be happy im in the final but right now im still a bit mad with myself
5620201 i always make hard work of it when have i ever had an easy ride never once i just accept that im never going to have an easy ride ill be fine
5620202 i was hoping not to need two throws because there were so many people in the pool but i had a bit of food poisoning last week at our training camp in macau and nerves mixed with food poisoning in an olympic qualifying round doesnt make for very good stomach cramps
5620203 i was struggling a bit and it wasnt a great first round but im pleased to be through

5620209 just prior to the attack on moore bertuzzi had been on a shift to kill a penalty had missed the shift change and had remained on the ice for longer than the rest of his line states crawfords third party defence
5620210 after being directed to get off the ice bertuzzi was on his way back to the bench when suddenly and without warning he turned around and skated back in the direction of moore and attacked moore
5620211 this was not done under any specific or general direction or encouragement from crawford was a direct disobedience of the instruction that bertuzzi had been given from the bench to get off the ice and was a violation of bertuzzis duties which crawford could not be expected to have reasonably anticipated let alone control
5620212 were we perfect absolutely not weve had missteps and those are the lessons learned it was over the last few years that we were able to incorporate all of the lessons learned that we have throughout this investigation
5620213 unfortunately a lot of them are not going to be able to be answered in the immediate future
5620214 i dont think no 1 were ever going to put the suspicions to bed
5620215 his only response was that he wanted to hang out there which was not a very compelling reason
5620216 in the end he also became the man who couldnt deliver bush was very slow to realize that he either had been had by musharraf or that musharraf was not up to the task historians will debate this for years
5620217 the new pakistani general hes just been elected not elected this guy took over office
5620218 it wasnt a personal relationship but musharraf tried to play it effectively for domestic advantage
5620219 we pretty much played the musharraf card ad nauseam eventually to pakistans detriment
5620220 so far ive found him to be a man of his word
5620221 the fundamental question i have for president musharraf is will these elections be under emergency rule or law because if they are its going to be hard for well itll be hard for those of us who have belief that hes advanced pakistans democracy to say thats thats still the case
5620222 president bush and vice president cheney backed a discredited dictator which has undercut our ability to work with the new government to eliminate the terrorist sanctuary that has re emerged in pakistans tribal areas
5620223 president musharraf took his country a long way in turning it back from the extremism that was starting to characterize it at the time of sept 11 2001 he also kept his promise to try and help a transition to free and fair elections we didnt agree with everything he did especially the state of emergency but he did take off the military uniform the elections were free and fair
5620224 he tried to play both ends moving against certain terrorist targets but more broadly letting the terrorists increase their influence in his own country he campaigned for democratic reform then staged faulty elections to help himself stay in power
5620225 technical delegations are working on it i will probably go to iran in 15 days together with foreign minister ali babacan we will continue to work to finalize it in a month
5620226 we are very close to deciding to send the prime minister for the closing ceremony of the olympics to be participated by many foreign dignitaries
5620227 while negotiations on a government of national unity are continuing it may be necessary to convene parliament to give effect to the will of the people as expressed in the parliamentary elections held on 29 march
5620228 we hope that no one would do anything to breach the memorandum of understanding on the talks
5620229 we dont have consensus to reconvene parliament how do you reconvene parliament with an illegitimate government
5620230 the zimbabwean issue is far from resolved and so the continent as a whole has a responsibility to continue to engage with us in finding solutions
5620231 part of it is actually a process of trying to unlock the deadlocks that have emerged in the negotiations
5620232 he was indias best bet in pakistan we will miss musharraf
5620233 if he had not fired his judges and gotten bogged down in domestic dramas i believe we would have been able to make a significant breakthrough in a peace deal in kashmir today
5620234 we have no comments to make on the resignation of president musharraf of pakistan
5620235 still musharraf was a one man go to guy in pakistan now who do we speak to these are very uncertain times

5620249 we in the south pacific and pacific island countries in particular take democracy very seriously that is why we believe we cannot sit idly by while the principles of democracy are shredded we look forward to the discussion that will now occur minus fiji in niue on how this matter should be handled in future
5620250 i think that it is absolutely regrettable that the leader of fiji has decided not to attend the forum it would have been far better for the leader of fiji to sit down with the leaders of the pacific island countries and answer for the commitments that have been previously given by fiji to fellow island states
5620251 if someone is not prepared to come and be accountable for breaking commitments given to leaders a year ago that in itself speaks volumes so i expect that there will be a robust outcome from the forum
5620252 there is no reasonable excuse at all for fiji not attending the pacific forum i personally intervened to ensure transit visas were available for the fiji delegation to go through auckland airport to niue so they could be accountable to the forum leaders for commitments given last year

5620281 its one of those situations where he assumed weve talked about assumptions thats an assumption on his part thats part of his game weve got to get rid of
5620282 i think everybody in here will do everything possible to make sure it doesnt happen again its not in joes hands any more its in nobodys hands but ours

5620286 i got this one right my mind is buzzing right now but i have to keep it under control
5620287 ill be getting a lane in the midddle for the semi final getting to mix it with the big boys and i feel that im ready
5620288 it was a big achievement for me to beat spearmon and that also helps my confidence
5620289 we can feel its euro 2008 still in their mind and that they cant wait for the competition and the qualifying campaign to start
5620290 those things leave traces there are so many qualities within the team that this failure can hardly be understood
5620291 after a bad competition we are always expecting the next game to show it was just an accident
5620292 the new generation is coming and mixed with the experienced ones i believe we can do something good
5620293 weve abandoned racing for today following 11mm of overnight rain
5620294 there has also been continuing rain this morning which started up again at around 8am

5620296 we are looking at the feasibility with the british horseracing authority and other parties at staging todays group races later this week

5620300 it just feels fantastic to come in with a medal this time and the fact that its gold is just amazing
5620301 i always knew it was going to be a bit of an up and down regatta i didnt start great in the first race but bounced straight back and then from there i was always within reaching distance and sailed a superb day yesterday to give myself the cushion i needed for today

5620312 the survey paints a stark picture of the challenging business environment that has emerged in the uk over the past year with the economy facing its most difficult period since the early 1990s this is now compounded by high and uncertain oil and commodity prices creating inflationary pressures and fall out from the uk housing market downturn which has continued to gather pace at the same time we are seeing a new realism among businesses about the need to weather the current economic conditions with projected staff and capital investment both significantly down on this time last year

5620329 i used to get into a lot of trouble and i was really horrible
5620330 i was having fights at school all the time and i was always really angry and nasty at my mum
5620331 she sent me to kickboxing to get rid of my aggression in a different way and im so grateful she did
5620332 i dont consider myself to be the best of the ten but colin trained us so hard and we were so fit for the competition that i think we all stood a good chance
5620333 it was a knockout tournament spread over two days so i had one fight the first day and two the second
5620334 i actually watched the girl i beat in the final earlier that day and was worried because she looked really good
5620335 colin told us to go and enjoy ourselves so i did by eating and drinking too much but im back training now
5620336 my aim now is to win a couple more fights and have a shot at another amateur title and then id like to turn professional next year
5620337 it is an ho nour to be recognized for our support and contribution to the derdack success story we have been partners for 2 years and in this time we have seen a growing interest and acceptance of the mobile messaging products offered by derdack in our region
5620338 the ease with which the derdack products can be integrated into existing it systems and the speed of implementation are very important aspects of the projects we undertake in addition the innovation and vision of the derdack team helps us create new opportunities for growing our business which is good news for both ihorizons and derdack
5620339 we invest time in ensuring our partner channel can be effective the annual derdack partner conference allows us to say thank you to our part ners update them on our plans for the year ahead and enable them to see new product developments we have built a strong revenue stream with the help of our partners and we all look forward to 2009 being another year of growth

5620342 these people have uploaded games and made them available to tens of thousands of people
5620343 what they are trying to do is deter people from illegally filesharing their games this is not a massive revenue generating exercise
5620344 some of our sandwich competitors use units that look like microwaves or toaster ovens to try and warm a few of their subs we have high end ovens in our stores that cost 30 000 and bake our sandwiches at 450 degrees it gives us a huge quality advantage they cant match
5620345 people fed up with brown bagging or driving to pick up something cold can save some time and gas by ordering a hot dominos sandwich for delivery to their home or office
5620346 we offer our constantly expanding collection of european wooden toys baby toys educational toys jewelry bags and childrens room decor items to urbane and discerning adults who want to expose the young children in their lives to non character branded quality toys we believe toys should be natural non violent and from manufacturers who provide safe and nurturing environments for their employees we believe in fair competitive pricing and strive for 100 customer satisfaction
5620347 this is surely an indictment on customer data standards at any organisation that sends transactional documents all of whom want to grasp the transpromo opportunity but a section of whom seem to be undermining that opportunity
5620348 if transpromo is to be effectively exploited there needs to be an improvement in customer data standards two fifths of the population have received bills or statements addressed to the wrong person in the last six months which could seriously undermine consumer attitudes to advertising carried in those documents the opportunities presented by transpromo are probably very considerable but their effective use requires british business to make significant enhancements to the way it manages and updates customer records
5620349 we successfully lured the calf about a kilometre out to sea probably the first time thats been done using a yacht as a surrogate mother
5620350 later we saw whales a bit further offshore and there was a slender chance it may have linked up with them but this morning we have got reports that it has returned to the western shores of pittwater
5620351 while its moving quite freely at the moment its condition would be expected to deteriorate over the next three days
5620352 weve consistently said it was a slim chance that it might link up with its mother or other whales but the reality is that in the wild for various reasons mothers sometimes reject their young
5620353 looking at its behaviour the way it was nuzzling up to yachts would indicate it was primarily still suckling
5620354 it really was trying to suckle just below the waterline and against the keel with its head engaged against the boat
5620355 may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5620356 a completely unsubstantiated obama campaign claim that john mccain somehow cheated

5620360 with our previous telephony solution we often felt that important phone calls were missed due to our small workforce and travelling demands the gohello solution has overcome this as calls are now routed directly to employees mobiles our customers may not have noticed our new telephone system but that can only be a good thing by using gohello we dont need to worry about taking messages keeping the office manned or costly business calls leaving us to do what we do best running the business
5620361 we are delighted with the popularity of fishtext and feedback so far indicates that users are extremely pleased with the service
5620362 fishtexts success demonstrates that traditional text messaging is an overpriced and underdeveloped service many users have expressed surprise that the fishtext mobile application delivers text messages all over the world so reliably for just a couple of pence while their own operator charges over ten times that amount with some not even providing delivery reports or charging extra for them
5620363 squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5620364 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5620365 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5620366 much to our mutual disappointment i wont be appearing in qts forthcoming inglorious bastards due to insurmountable scheduling difficulties we really tried to make it work but in the end it just was not possible without severe ramifications elsewhere im trying to remain upbeat as
5620367 sci fi is our umbrella brand for casual and online gaming in the uk and other countries outside the usa science fiction and fantasy fans have a huge affinity with gaming and our relationship with bigpoint will allow us to take advantage of growing popularity of multiple players

5620369 whilst operators understandably dont want to be perceived as trying to unfairly glean excess revenues from unwitting subscribers while abroad taking a one size fits all approach blocking their usage while abroad will result in them losing very significant revenues at a time when you would expect them to be looking to maximise their 3g network investments
5620370 operators need to take better control of their network assets so that they can offer a bespoke service to each user on a case by case basis
5620371 in a competitive european market where operators are increasingly trying to differentiate their service and the many millions of corporate subscribers are becoming increasingly international operators surely have no choice but to ensure they maximise all mobile broadband revenue opportunities whilst offering subscribers the best possible service

5620374 one of humanitys great conquests is indeed the overcoming of racism unfortunately however there are new and worrying examples of this in various countries often linked to social and economic problems that nonetheless can never justify contempt or racial discrimination
5620375 and therefore also to italy where sorry to say there are many signs of racism that trouble us and which cannot be hidden

5620384 he was a man who kept himself to himself but he was friendly he always said hello
5620385 its amazing he was not extravagant he was quite a reserved man but he was pleasant
5620386 we are very grateful to william kinghorn for his generous legacy
5620387 gifts left in wills are extremely important to the charity
5620388 i feel a bit indifferent i know ive done well with the hard bit im pleased with my as
5620389 im thrilled id like to thank all my teachers and my mum and dad for their help and support
5620390 the very able students have done well and won their places at top universities but there are some significant success stories from those who have had to work to achieve pass grades
5620391 the time we spent in the village opened my eyes to another way of life the people really made us feel welcome and showed great hospitality i felt like a member of the community and will never forget our time there
5620392 weve met some amazing people and seen how they live which has made me realise that we are only a tiny part of the world and that we should open our eyes to other cultures it was an experience i wont forget
5620393 these two weeks have been one of the best experiences of my life there were many challenges we had to face and not many people can say they camped in the sahara desert in temperatures of over 50c working in the village was so rewarding knowing how much it was appreciated
5620394 mohamed made the trip so special and thrilling a once in a lifetime trip by showing us the different cultures and environments of morocco including the sweltering camel trip in the sahara and aguersioual village in the atlas mountains i want to go back to the country and the village
5620395 this was another example of just how adaptable our young people are they went with open minds and realised just how much people from much poorer backgrounds have and how much we can learn from this
5620396 this is the fifth world expedition i have organised in the geography department and i feel really privileged to be able to show people from barrow very different sides of life i maintain that travelling doesnt necessarily broaden the mind because your mind needs to be open in the first place
5620397 but looking at these figures it looks like theres been a marked improvement in year nine pupils performance so that now theyre significantly out achieving national averages
5620398 school children in this county are getting a better and better foundation in the core subjects that set them up for the future but we are not complacent we are setting challenging targets for the future and have in place a major programme of change in secondary education which will revolutionise performance in some of our weaker schools
5620399 the tale so far is one of significant improvement across the board for both girls and boys
5620400 there has been research to show if parents are involved with childrens learning children do better
5620401 parental involvement in childrens learning is vital and the framework really supports this
5620402 it brings these frameworks together to make a more coherent nought to five framework its what early years educators have been striving for for a long time it follows a pattern used in new zealand called te wharike weaving together frameworks
5620403 all the areas are of equal importance but personal social and emotional development is the key one if you dont have personal social and emotional development in place then the other learning cant happen effectively
5620404 it hopes children reach the goals by the end of reception but some children wont so there needs to be a sensitive using of the framework
5620405 im feeling a bit sad today i miss granny granpa
5620406 you look a bit sad today lets do something nice to cheer us up
5620407 we are looking at certain major cities and towns that are vulnerable and could be possible targets and we are now in the process of securing these places
5620408 the fact that we remained on alert and the fact that the interior secretary ronaldo puno ordered local chief executives and the police to establish community defenses is already a sign that we might see other attacks
5620409 if this should happen we hope not it will be more of the same
5620410 after going through charley this doesnt seem nothing more than a gust of wind
5620411 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5620412 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5620413 we just want to make sure its not a problem

5620429 were so excited to be returning to the studio to work with jason hes a phenomenal producer and we adore working with him the songs we recorded in february that we originally wanted to release as a 4 song demo turned out better than anything weve done so far in our career weve decided to put them on our debut record for jason to finish the album starting september 1st for the demo we did in february we did pre production on the 4 songs with a wonderful producer named don debiase whos worked with bands like beneath the sky we arent sure if well be able to coordinate schedules with him to do pre production on the remainder of the album because september is right around the corner but we are 100 confirmed to start recording with jason on the 1st we did release one song from our february session for streaming only on our myspace page its called ruin and we hope you like it we cant wait to finish the album and bring some more metal to you all

5620449 were looking at it heading to the northeast as it makes landfall
5620450 if it doesnt make it onshore as a hurricane which it looks like it wont then we would continue to see winds lessen and lessen in the bay area kacmarik said

5620452 in the end he also became the man who couldnt deliver bush was very slow to realize that he either had been had by musharraf or that musharraf was not up to the task historians will debate this for years
5620453 the new pakistani general hes just been elected not elected this guy took over office
5620454 it wasnt a personal relationship but musharraf tried to play it effectively for domestic advantage
5620455 we pretty much played the musharraf card ad nauseam eventually to pakistans detriment
5620456 so far ive found him to be a man of his word
5620457 the fundamental question i have for president musharraf is will these elections be under emergency rule or law because if they are its going to be hard for well itll be hard for those of us who have belief that hes advanced pakistans democracy to say thats thats still the case
5620458 president bush and vice president cheney backed a discredited dictator which has undercut our ability to work with the new government to eliminate the terrorist sanctuary that has re emerged in pakistans tribal areas
5620459 president musharraf took his country a long way in turning it back from the extremism that was starting to characterize it at the time of sept 11 2001 he also kept his promise to try and help a transition to free and fair elections we didnt agree with everything he did especially the state of emergency but he did take off the military uniform the elections were free and fair
5620460 he tried to play both ends moving against certain terrorist targets but more broadly letting the terrorists increase their influence in his own country he campaigned for democratic reform then staged faulty elections to help himself stay in power
5620461 we assure you that we will do our best to be the voice of africa along with african nations on the security council

5620467 ons doelpubliek is het woon werkverkeer en het woon schoolverkeer voor die mensen hebben we w l interessante tarieven de gemiddelde prijs voor een gezin ligt hier tussen de 1 200 en de 1 300 euro per jaar

5620470 i think the deaf and hard of hearing community welcome any chance to go see a movie i think we dont think about when its just sound they cant hear it
5620471 were thrilled with the aspect there will be open caption movies coming back to chattanooga
5620472 deaf parenting uk is delighted to have emmerdales support and recognition of our work and the needs of deaf parents in uk we continue to work hard on limited budget and vastly on voluntary basis to raise the profile of deaf parenting uk to the mainstream as well as championing the needs and rights of deaf parents in accessing to mainstream services without barriers
5620473 if you are a parent yourselves it is challenging being a parent but for deaf parents it is even more challenging as information and services are not accessible for deaf parents who use sign language as first main language
5620474 little things like access to info during pregnancy birth the choices of labour birth planning the baby childs first few years their education
5620475 deaf parenting uk is working hard to reach out to deaf parents enabling them to have confidence in being parents as well as to raise awareness of deaf parenting issues among deaf parents and professionals who work with them
5620476 for those reasons all cast from emmerdale production team are thrilled in support of deaf parenting uk and wish to highlight that deaf parents should have the same opportunities in life as any other parents in accessing to information and services
5620477 there are micro melodies on the album generally layers and layers of stuff hopefully the more you listen to it the more new stuff will reveal itself stuff you didnt notice the first few times you played it its intricate but that should mean its more rewarding over the distance so that people can go back to it and hear new things each time
5620478 each song is approached in a different way but i often use a commodore amiga 500 for sequencing work
5620479 i dont use pcs or macs i use a midi device to control the various instruments and hardware the keyboards synthesizers and samplers and it all gets recorded onto a hard disk machine hopefully its a more pristine sound than before but with the warmth of my other records
5620480 there are trumpets violins cellos guitars dulcimers xylophones whatevers lying around
5620481 thats another reason the record took so long to make i thought a cello would be good so i had to spend three weeks learning to play that part and then layering it with so much stuff that people wouldnt notice that im not exactly an amazing cello player

5620487 he and daryl mitchell are fast becoming one of the most reliable opening partnerships in the county championship and i am pleased we will see this partnership develop over the next few years
5620488 i know that stephen has aspirations to play for england and it is well known how committed we are to developing players for england
5620489 it is testament to the club that he has chosen to pursue those aspirations with us when so many counties were after his signature
5620490 i am really pleased to continue my career with worcestershire and i am looking forward to taking the field with the current squad of talented players and competing for trophies and championships in the future
5620491 by doing this i hope that myself and other members of the squad can push for further honours with england

5620494 if youre one of the many developers who were waiting for something a bit more mature
5620495 this might be a good time to take another look
5620496 the beta sdk that were releasing today is the first big step on the sdks road to compatibility with 1 0
5620497 since this is a beta release applications developed with it may not quite be compatible with devices running the final android 1 0 however the apis are now pretty stable and we dont expect any major changes
5620498 since were now moving quickly toward 1 0 it may also help to know which direction were headed to help out weve also prepared a this will be a living document and well keep it up to date as the android landscape evolves currently it covers the next few months roughly through the end of the year and a bit into next year well update it with additional detail as we are able to but even right now it can help give you a picture of how things will play out as the first phones draw near enough of that though youre probably wondering whats actually new in the sdk well you should read the api delta report for all the details but here are a few highlights first and most obviously the new home screen is included along with a ton of ui changes for 1 0 some new applications are included an alarm clock calculator camera music player picture viewer and messaging for sms mms conversations several new development tools were added such as a graphical preview for xml layouts for users of eclipse and a tool for constructing 9 patch images since weve got a new home screen application now we thought the now obsolete version from the m5 early look sdk might be helpful to developers so its source is included as a sample a number of new apis are fleshed out and improved and others are now close to their final forms for 1 0 tons of bugs were fixed of course if you had problems with the mediaplayer try it now there are a lot of changes the ones in the list above are just my personal favorites so you should check out the links above for the full story not all the changes are additions though im sorry to say that we had to remove a few things such as the gtalkservice for security reasons and the bluetooth api theres a bit more detail in the links above and well follow up on those in particular here in this blog to give you the scoop in fact weve got a little list of topics we want to talk about here so stay tuned

5620554 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful

5620562 i went to law school and all they wanted to talk about were these ghastly lawsuits
5620563 i went to medical school and the whole lot seemed preoccupied with hospitals and medical care and such
5620564 my time in the economics program was wasted with all sorts of boring numbers dreadful i tell you
5620565 he claims to now owe 175 000 in tuition fees
5620566 for all its vast reputation power and pomposity you feel that hbs neither understands the complexity nor acknowledges the chaotic unpredictability of the world economy any better than anyone else
5620567 i get the sense that this guy really doesnt understand capitalism at all i mean making huge amounts of money is a very socially responsible thing to do if you play by the rules people make lots of money because they provide lots of value to society
5620568 we need to resuscitate that shared vision and commitment the unity and cohesion that have characterised sadc from its inception as we consider the next step that will be required further to advance our regional integration efforts in southern africa
5620569 the increase in intra sadc trade requires a vibrant transport infrastructure while seamless network are needed to interconnect land locked countries as well as link them to the major ports
5620570 it is my strong belief that the private sector has a key role to play especially in the area of regional infrastructure

5620575 sen obama made it clear that he was really going to get into the nuts and bolts of the kinds of questions oregonians are talking about and i think it has served him well in our state
5620576 im confident that once sen obama gets as well known in these larger states as he has in oregon he is going to see the same success elswhere
5620577 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
5620578 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
5620579 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
5620580 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
5620581 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
5620582 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
5620583 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
5620584 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
5620585 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
5620586 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
5620587 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
5620588 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
5620589 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
5620590 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
5620591 we the citizens of the united states of america have the ultimate responsibility to elect the
5620592 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
5620593 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
5620594 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
5620595 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
5620596 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
5620597 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
5620598 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
5620599 this is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it
5620600 i dont think theres anything more unseemly than the sight of a rock star in academic robes its a bit like when people put their king charles spaniels in little tartan sweats and hats its not natural and it doesnt make the dog any smarter
5620601 what happens is the water tunnels to the bottom and makes the ice like swiss cheese sort of like termites
5620602 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
5620603 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
5620604 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
5620605 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
5620606 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
5620607 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
5620608 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
5620609 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
5620610 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
5620611 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
5620612 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
5620613 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
5620614 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
5620615 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
5620616 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
5620617 they were all our first choices everyone said yes which is so rare
5620618 our motto has been get the story right get the facts right tell it honestly
5620619 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
5620620 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
5620621 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
5620622 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
5620623 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
5620624 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
5620625 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
5620626 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
5620627 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
5620628 and captains of work must always be but there is a wide difference between being captains of work and taking the profits of it
5620629 even a great mistake a lifelong mistake and perhaps as long as eternity too
5620630 so are you saying that were all just like really excellent sheep
5620631 a full portfolio of resources can ease the energy crunch
5620632 this being my first match there was some rustiness besides you had two players who know each other inside out it was more of a mind game for i knew what he was going to do and he knew what i was up to so the trick was to out think each other
5620633 every time i took a lead he would catch up with me and it was getting very nagging i also had trouble while standing back as i could not gauge the ball and had most of the time dipping it just in front thats why i could not put top spin and was lobbing it which made it easy for him
5620634 i lost to him 4 3 in the austrian open but that was a really close match and im talking about a match that took place two years back things have changed a lot since then and ill put my best foot forward tomorrow
5620635 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5620636 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5620637 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5620638 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5620639 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5620640 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5620641 many in the christian right tend to get their information
5620642 id be remiss if i didnt say hello buddy cianci mayor of providence
5620643 i want you to know i was wearing my rhode island democrats t shirt when i was exercising this morning put that in the paper
5620644 i get amused when i see that stern faced young man from colorado extolling the merits of assault weapons
5620645 i didnt see any donkeys although we heard a weird sound when we first got in here
5620646 they must have you know seen me coming but they all hid somewhere
5620647 i dont care if you have jesus christ in the van
5620648 no i know if i needed to get out id make my way out just as i made my way in you have to see the possibilities
5620649 if my opponent had been there at the moon launch it would have been called a risky rocket scheme
5620650 if hed been there when edison was testing the light bulb it would have been a risky anti candle scheme
5620651 and if hed been there when the internet was invented
5620652 there was a ramp that went over the rubble my son brendan and i were able to come here and all the world stops when we had whole bodies or something that would resemble a whole body and people would line up on each side of this makeshift ramp and i went down with my son brendan and we were able to collect jonathan he was already in a basket and ive got to stop for a second so we were able to go down spend a little time and then brendan and myself and some of the guys in jons company we carried him up put him in an ambulance and took jon away we were blessed in a way because my son was a whole body
5620653 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
5620654 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
5620655 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
5620656 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
5620657 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
5620658 who would have thought last year that me and t boone pickens would be in the same boat pulling the same oar the same way
5620659 when you go to the gas pump you dont check whether you are a democrat or republican
5620660 now dependent on foreign nations for 70 percent of its oil the u s is exporting 700 billion annually more than four times the cost of the iraq war
5620661 there are people standing by with billions ready to invest in the future sun wind geothermal biomass
5620662 we cant drill our way of this situation but we will do everything we can to produce more domestic energy just two years ago i pushed for 8 3 million acres of drill sites in the gulf of mexico now that is done
5620663 any credible domestic energy policy must reduce our dependence on foreign oil by at least 30 percent in the next 10 years
5620664 he understands the issues and is interested and excited by the work we are doing to educate and involve the people
5620665 importing 70 percent of our oil now thats an issue of security its going to take us 10 years to reduce our dependency by 30 percent
5620666 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
5620667 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
5620668 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5620669 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5620670 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5620671 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5620672 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5620673 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
5620674 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
5620675 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
5620676 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
5620677 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
5620678 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
5620679 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
5620680 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
5620681 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
5620682 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
5620683 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
5620684 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
5620685 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
5620686 just so you all know we did set a record
5620687 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
5620688 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
5620689 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
5620690 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
5620691 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
5620692 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
5620693 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
5620694 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
5620695 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
5620696 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
5620697 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
5620698 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
5620699 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
5620700 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
5620701 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
5620702 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
5620703 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
5620704 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
5620705 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
5620706 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
5620707 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
5620708 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
5620709 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
5620710 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
5620711 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
5620712 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source
5620713 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
5620714 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
5620715 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
5620716 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
5620717 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
5620718 where we have strong emotions were liable to fool ourselves
5620719 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
5620720 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
5620721 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
5620722 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
5620723 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
5620724 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
5620725 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming
5620726 obama mccain discussion with megachurch minister warren has auburn producer director
5620727 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
5620728 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
5620729 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
5620730 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability

5620732 if youre one of the many developers who were waiting for something a bit more mature
5620733 this might be a good time to take another look
5620734 the beta sdk that were releasing today is the first big step on the sdks road to compatibility with 1 0
5620735 since this is a beta release applications developed with it may not quite be compatible with devices running the final android 1 0 however the apis are now pretty stable and we dont expect any major changes
5620736 since were now moving quickly toward 1 0 it may also help to know which direction were headed to help out weve also prepared a this will be a living document and well keep it up to date as the android landscape evolves currently it covers the next few months roughly through the end of the year and a bit into next year well update it with additional detail as we are able to but even right now it can help give you a picture of how things will play out as the first phones draw near enough of that though youre probably wondering whats actually new in the sdk well you should read the api delta report for all the details but here are a few highlights first and most obviously the new home screen is included along with a ton of ui changes for 1 0 some new applications are included an alarm clock calculator camera music player picture viewer and messaging for sms mms conversations several new development tools were added such as a graphical preview for xml layouts for users of eclipse and a tool for constructing 9 patch images since weve got a new home screen application now we thought the now obsolete version from the m5 early look sdk might be helpful to developers so its source is included as a sample a number of new apis are fleshed out and improved and others are now close to their final forms for 1 0 tons of bugs were fixed of course if you had problems with the mediaplayer try it now there are a lot of changes the ones in the list above are just my personal favorites so you should check out the links above for the full story not all the changes are additions though im sorry to say that we had to remove a few things such as the gtalkservice for security reasons and the bluetooth api theres a bit more detail in the links above and well follow up on those in particular here in this blog to give you the scoop in fact weve got a little list of topics we want to talk about here so stay tuned
5620737 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
5620738 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
5620739 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
5620740 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
5620741 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
5620742 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
5620743 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
5620744 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
5620745 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
5620746 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
5620747 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that

5620749 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
5620750 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
5620751 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
5620752 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
5620753 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
5620754 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
5620755 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
5620756 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
5620757 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
5620758 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
5620759 oh my gosh the ice caps are melting and were all gonna die before lunch
5620760 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative
5620761 which is as textbook a case of the pot calling the kettle black as has ever been recorded
5620762 gore is the person who in the congress most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an internet
5620763 has played a powerful role in policy terms that has supported its continued growth and application for which we should be thankful
5620764 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years

5620776 quando si ha finito di lavarsi al mattino bisogna fare con cura la pulizia del pianeta bisogna costringersi regolarmente a strappare i baobab appena li si distingue dai rosai ai quali assomigliano molto quando sono piccoli e un lavoro molto noioso ma facile
5620777 e un giorno mi consiglio di fare un bel disegno per far entrare bene questa idea nella testa dei bambini del mio paese
5620778 questo consiglio gli potra servire qualche volta e senza inconvenienti rimettere a piu tardi il proprio lavoro ma se si tratta dei baobab e sempre una catastrofe ho conosciuto un pianeta abitato da un pigro aveva trascurato gli arbusti

5620784 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
5620785 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
5620786 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
5620787 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again

5620814 weve had a very disturbing trend of school shootings in the us
5620815 it is my belief this is caused by making schools gun free zones when schools were made gun free zones they became targets for people who wanted to rack up the body count
5620816 its up there with the worst ideas in the history of education
5620817 you could have a gun accidentally taken away or a gun could be dislodged or discharged while a teachers breaking up a fight in the cafeteria
5620818 allowing armed staff and teachers will provide a last line of defence if other security measures at the school fail
5620819 officers cant be everywhere and in an emergency every second counts

5620835 its an ancient concept in judaism that the spiritual and the physical are united that to win a war you need both spirit and strength
5620836 you need people fighting but you also need people learning and praying
5620837 this sounds funny to the western ear what can a man learning in a yeshiva all day possibly give back to the world
5620838 torah learning that we do is the hidden code of the physical existence of all mankind and if for one single second there is no torah learning in the air all the world would go back to chaos
5620839 theres no point to our physical existence without a spiritual purpose and i as the husband who is learning all day am primarily responsible for that

5620869 if youre one of the many developers who were waiting for something a bit more mature
5620870 this might be a good time to take another look
5620871 the beta sdk that were releasing today is the first big step on the sdks road to compatibility with 1 0
5620872 since this is a beta release applications developed with it may not quite be compatible with devices running the final android 1 0 however the apis are now pretty stable and we dont expect any major changes
5620873 since were now moving quickly toward 1 0 it may also help to know which direction were headed to help out weve also prepared a this will be a living document and well keep it up to date as the android landscape evolves currently it covers the next few months roughly through the end of the year and a bit into next year well update it with additional detail as we are able to but even right now it can help give you a picture of how things will play out as the first phones draw near enough of that though youre probably wondering whats actually new in the sdk well you should read the api delta report for all the details but here are a few highlights first and most obviously the new home screen is included along with a ton of ui changes for 1 0 some new applications are included an alarm clock calculator camera music player picture viewer and messaging for sms mms conversations several new development tools were added such as a graphical preview for xml layouts for users of eclipse and a tool for constructing 9 patch images since weve got a new home screen application now we thought the now obsolete version from the m5 early look sdk might be helpful to developers so its source is included as a sample a number of new apis are fleshed out and improved and others are now close to their final forms for 1 0 tons of bugs were fixed of course if you had problems with the mediaplayer try it now there are a lot of changes the ones in the list above are just my personal favorites so you should check out the links above for the full story not all the changes are additions though im sorry to say that we had to remove a few things such as the gtalkservice for security reasons and the bluetooth api theres a bit more detail in the links above and well follow up on those in particular here in this blog to give you the scoop in fact weve got a little list of topics we want to talk about here so stay tuned

5620895 what it does is take away the rights and power of property owners and passes that on to the zoning board and city council
5620896 there are no guidelines with respect to the zoning board
5620897 and certainly not with the specificity of the building code
5620898 the intention is not to hurt or hinder peoples rights but to give a budding property owner a voice
5620899 we never ever intended to put extra burden on people who had a natural disaster
5620900 but we are tired of the landlords that want to be slumlords in this city
5620901 my thing is if you see a bus you should be keenly aware that there are valuable things on that bus
5620902 to make everyone aware of what happens when those school buses get out on the street
5620903 we simply have about a zero percent tolerance for violating the law because those signs are up to protect the students
5620904 weve been lucky that we have had no accidents but you just want to minimize the exposure to any risk for the kids
5620905 mainly people are just trying to drive past the stop arms because theyre in a hurry
5620906 theyre not our buses and theyre not our drivers but they are our kids
5620907 we dont really have too much of an issue there
5620908 we probably get calls from the public about two times a year
5620909 it usually happens every day some days are worse than others especially in the springtime our drivers have to be more aware
5620910 if it becomes a major issue here then we will work with law enforcement to attempt to encourage arrests of those who put childrens safety in jeopardy
5620911 youll see their expressions and they realize theyre making a mistake
5620912 a lot of it is teenagers theyre in a hurry to get to school
5620913 if theyre speeding past us its not always possible we turn them in to the police to follow through
5620914 our drivers are trained to be really careful but weve had a few close calls its a hazard my drivers try to be aware of

5620925 la 1701 ha spiegato nissi prevede fra laltro la piena applicazione della risoluzione 1559 soprattutto per quanto concerne il disarmo di tutte le milizie operanti in libano e chiede la chiusura del confine fra siria e libano al passaggio di armi e munizioni in particolare quelle dirette a hezbollah pertanto hezbollah sta violando alla grande la 1701 e non solo nascondendo le proprie armi nei depositi nel libano meridionale oltretutto non abbiamo visto uscire dal libano meridionale una sola arma per cui cosa ha fatto hezbollah di tutti gli armamenti usati nella guerra del 2006 li ha gettati in mare
5620926 essersi coordinato con hezbollah e non con il governo libanese
5620927 lo dice chiaramente no armi a sud del fiume litani no milizie a sud del fiume litani questo il motivo per cui lunifil si trova l il mandato dellunifil coordinarsi con hezbollah o cacciare fuori hezbollah dal territorio libanese a sud del litani
5620928 quello che so che stanno ben attenti a non sfidare lunifil e che per questo non si fanno vedere in giro uomini di hezbollah armati dal punto di vista dellunifil questo equivale al rispetto della risoluzione in libano tutti hanno armi quello che forse graziano intendeva dire che nessuno va in giro con le armi in vista a sud del litani tranne i soldati libanesi le truppe unifil e i cacciatori locali in questo senso avrebbe ragione

5620968 the cav was formally established in 2006 in response to the urgent need for the creation of an aerospace supplier park to support south africas innovative manufacturing processes
5620969 this supplier park is not only modelled on the successes of the local automotive industry but also mirrors similar international parks such as the silicone valley in california and toulouse in france
5620970 not only will the project lead to increased job creation but would also serve to accelerate the integration of small companies in the industry
5620971 the objectives of the cav include the development construction and full operation of an aerospace supplier park the upliftement of small medium and micro enterprises smmes and for the repositioning of the aviation sector
5620972 the cav has been designed to unlock the growth potential of the local aerospace and aviation industries where local original equipment manufacturers suppliers of components parts and tools as well as service providers stand to benefit equally from synergistic and economy of scale applications
5620973 the cav concept was not however limited to manufacturing but also offers opportunities in service related activities including logistics training and technology centres shared services and co ordinated education

5621041 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country

5621061 this photograph captured these elements but what made it more unusual is that the gymnast came from under the lower bar
5621062 here certainly there is no place for the vain argument of those who defend the foreknowledge of god against the grace of god and accordingly maintain that we were elected before the foundation of the world because god foreknew that we would be good not that he himself would make us good this is not the language of him who said you did not choose me but i chose you john 15 16

5621069 i think the government is concerned that the insurance market should develop to enable businesses to protect themselves because existing public liability clauses do not normally cover any regular operating or any environmental exposure apart from that which is accidental
5621070 repaying the agency for the clean up was not covered
5621071 major organisations in key industries like fertiliser manufacturers and those in the petrol and chemical industries have environmental liability insurance in place already however smes which have previously been considered low risk may want to consider these issues following the introduction of the new directive

5621131 durch den zielgruppengerechten zuschnitt der triple play pakete und die vielfalt bei digitalen tv programmen haben die kunden immer mehr auswahl finden aber trotzdem in wenigen klicks zur gew nschten information
5621132 as a long time technical advisor to visual numerics im pleased to see the company extending the imsl c library to python developers
5621133 it gives their commercial customers an outstanding option to quickly prototype in python and then write production applications in c using the same algorithms for the education community making the imsl libraries accessible to python developers is important given the growing popularity of the language python is very popular on campus these days but good numerical packages are difficult to find
5621134 we are committed to offering our customers the highest quality most sophisticated numerical analysis solutions for mainstream platforms
5621135 visual numerics is proud to extend the imsl libraries to python and bring such strong analytics to python developers
5621136 in an economic environment with considerable uncertainty our fourth straight year of double digit revenue growth clearly demonstrates that clients increasingly desire the top quality global integrated services that we are committed to provide as a result we expect to continue to grow as more corporate and financial institutions appreciate the depth and value of our global platform not only clients but also potential recruits are coming to appreciate and understand the strength of our platform and so we are experiencing worldwide an unprecedented number of approaches from top quality talent
5621137 we are very grateful for this encouraging client response to the extraordinary efforts of our lawyers and professional staff around the world we remain confident that we are on the right track but we also know theres much more to be done if we are to achieve our ambition to position baker amp mckenzie as the premier global law firm
5621138 als ein langj hriger berater von visual numerics freut es mich zu sehen dass die numerische bibliothek imsl c nun auch pythonentwicklern verf gbar gemacht wird
5621139 dies gibt ihren kunden die hervorragende m glichkeit prototypen schnell in python zu entwickeln und dann anwendungsprogramme in c unter verwendung der gleichen algorithmen zu schreiben
5621140 wir haben uns verpflichtet unseren kunden h chste qualit t und anspruchsvolle numerische analyse f r etablierte plattformen zu liefern
5621141 visual numerics ist stolz die numerischen imsl bibliotheken nun auch auf python erweitert zu haben und so entwicklern berzeugende analysetools zur verf gung zu stellen
5621142 our strong balance sheet and the long term secured cash flows constitute the right ingredients to manage alstria successfully through the current market conditions although this specific financing is only the first step of a global plan to better align the maturity of our debt with the maturity of our assets between now and 2011 we believe it also helps to address some short term concerns with regards to the ability of alstria to raise or refinance debt in the current market this financing clearly demonstrates that there is currently sufficient liquidity in the german debt market to finance high quality assets at attractive terms
5621143 although that the lower values of the whole german real estate have caused us to report a net loss for the period this impact was limited by the effect of rent increases and other asset management activities this however does not influence the cash generation capabilities of alstria as this is not dependent on the state of the real estate investment market we are therefore very pleased to be able to confirm today the eur 101 million of revenues and eur 40 million of ffo guidance for the full year 2008

5621618 he has served his sentence and the authorities in vietnam will deport him he does not have any sentence to serve in london if he wants to stop wherever he wants to he can do that
5621619 if he wants to he can change flights he is a free man from today the only problem is the countries he wants to go to because he has to get a visa
5621620 i would hope that the authorities make sure that gary glitter does not slip off to another country
5621621 once youre overseas you can just go from country to country we know that some of the most high risk offenders do that
5621622 glitter is a persistent offender responsible for a catalogue of sexual crimes against children on his return to the uk the authorities must assess the level of risk he poses to children and make sure he is carefully managed and supervised in the community to keep children safe from harm
5621623 there is a massive question mark over whether he will have criminal charges brought before him
5621624 certainly that was the declared intention of nawaz sharif the former prime minister now one of the main partners in the coalition government and the man musharraf ousted in a coup in 1999 he said before musharraf resigned that he wanted to see him stand trial that he wanted to see him put in jail
5621625 and of course amongst the possible charges is treason and the maximum sentence for that is death
5621626 i think it was quite clear when we saw that guard of honour as he left the presidential palace that the army is in no mood to see their former boss humiliated
5621627 the goodbye was full of respect it was a clear signal to the country and definitely to the coalition leaders that this is a man that they still have a lot of pride in and hes not to be messed with and they will try to protect him

5621632 my suggestion was that we come back to albany now on august 19th tomorrow and that i will close the deficit internally that we have
5621633 and the legislature will address a possible deficit that we can have after that by matching me with a 600 million cut were rolling the dice if we dont get to 600 million because well have to come right back and be in deficit
5621634 were not going to cut aid to education that would bring it back to the property tax payer were not going to cut the quality of healthcare that new yorkers want and i dont think its appropriate to lay off state workers but i think were at 300 to 400 million
5621635 i think it borders on criminality you cannot threaten people to give contributions certainly thats not the change i think people are looking for thats thuggery
5621636 with regard to the comment senator skelos made calling me a thug i think that demeans his position and has questionable overtones
5621637 the deals are possible to be made but one misconception is that this is a way to make some easy money and thats just not the case
5621638 one of the great things about the lis pendens stage is it looks exactly like a normal sale
5621639 you should work with a broker youd be able to go look at the property
5621640 the seller is able to sell the home without damaging their credit report
5621641 you as a buyer you receive the home that you want probably at a discounted price and the bank wins too because they dont have to go through the costly painful process of foreclosure
5621642 its not for the feint of heart because many times when you bid you have to be able to put up cash money and you dont have that opportunity to inspect the house
5621643 you also may purchase a property with someone living in the property and then if you purchase that property you are now the owner and you have a tenant and you have to go through the eviction process
5621644 the bank then goes out and gets a broker to represent that property so then youre really doing a transaction a normal transaction with a broker
5621645 what really makes our stuff different than the typical animation you see out there is our characters instead of telling a story theyre playing a piece of music so instead of dialogue their hands or little moving parts are playing music
5621646 dave is more of the hardcore trained artist and my background is much more in music and in computers and animation
5621647 i write a lot of the software that we use to drive all of this partially because you cant just buy off the shelf software that you plug music into and animation comes up its not the way stuff is usually done
5621648 we can start an animation from any number of angles
5621649 you could start literally writing all the music first and then deciding what the instruments look like weve done that before we could actually design a whole instrument without figuring out any music for it to play until its done and weve done that as well or the ideal way to do it is where youre co developing the music and the instruments together

5621654 what the viewer can do is interrupt this state of grieving
5621655 so the viewer can just go and gently touch the work and it causes her to respond she begins to wipe away a section of the condensation that is really like a layer of atmospheric difference between her and us and she creates this little opening which is an opening for connection so you can see her and she can see you and in that moment i think there is a kind possibility for understanding
5621656 when you see this person in this state what you want to do is reach out and touch her
5621657 ive seen people stand with their hand on this glass for a really long time people do different things its interesting some people completely mirror her actions so they want to copy her actions

5621659 he was a virtuoso at age five and was toured by his parents all over the world
5621660 he was a real child prodigy both as a composer and a performer so i think that also has an appeal he is a remarkable phenomenon and what i find wonderful about him as a subject for a festival is he feels as alive today as he did in the time in which he lived
5621661 theyre wrong because whatever they think of classical music that isnt what it is

5621663 its great therapy for me im not trying to make it from the bed to the bathroom ive extended my tour all the way to new york
5621664 what i enjoyed the most was playing in a little joint for the fun of it not to become known not to capitalize on it make a fortune or a big name or any of that but just to have fun
5621665 its in the feet its in the knees its in the back its in the shoulders in the elbows and the wrist and the hands its all over
5621666 see i must have changed playing the guitar five times five times and each time you have less to work with
5621667 dont be foolish and try to play like you were when you were 20 years old and so you do the best you can and the people will accept you the way you are now
5621668 it took a long time for me to say doggone it i missed that note i missed that note

5621796 when you establish a mine like this it becomes a part of your community
5621797 and bokan mountain has turned out to be one of north americas largest rare earth element deposits
5621798 going through this years budget im proud to say 90 percent of our 4 million was directed to alaska based firms
5621799 by that time we should know how many pounds of each mineral we have in the ground and well be able to start going on to the next phase in the next two years of whats called mine pre feasibility
5621800 finally i figure between 2011 and 2013 the mine permitting and mine construction
5621801 bottom up development by concentrating on micro finance vocational training and community development programs
5621802 to continue the andean counter drug program and update it to meet evolving challenges we will fully support colombias fight against the farc well work with the government to end the reign of terror from right wing paramilitaries we will support colombias right to strike terrorists who seek safe haven across its borders and we will shine a light on any support for the farc that comes from neighboring governments this behavior must be exposed to international condemnation regional isolation and if need be strong sanctions
5621803 its time for a new alliance of the americas after eight years of the failed policies of the past we need new leadership for the future after decades pressing for top down reform we need an agenda that advances democracy security and opportunity from the bottom up so my policy towards the americas will be guided by the simple principle that whats good for the people of the americas is good for the united states
5621804 whats good for the people of the americas is good for the united states
5621805 i wish i could smile when im nervous i cant even talk
5621806 i think they are going to be the olympic champions for sure
5621807 i think nobody is going to beat them we are happy to go for the bronze
5621808 i told them im going to see you up on the podium and well be sitting side by side again
5621809 but im not playing ive got to be the nice guy
5621810 it was hard at first but now i can talk about it freely
5621811 canadian professional chuckwagon association competitors lost seven outriding horses and the pull horse of mine
5621812 thats eight head of horse that we had to put down this weekend on this track
5621813 we were too close so i couldnt get around him
5621814 it was lucky mitsuings wagon didnt veer left or it would have been a big mess
5621815 the other two gorst and waldenbach had infractions when they left the start
5621816 i guess its a win but its not how i wanted to win it
5621817 if it wasnt for the misfortune i would have had the pcs championship
5621818 this is the worst track weve ran on all season
5621819 the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
5621820 they need to resurface the whole thing if they are going to keep running horses on it
5621821 ive been around it my whole life my grandpa did it my dad did it
5621822 since my dads been driving ive wanted to outride i knew that right away
5621823 the better the outrider you are the more heats youre gonna ride in
5621824 i was riding the heat jumping into the wagon box then id jump off the wagonbox onto the outriding horse and not even miss a heat
5621825 i really want to concentrate on making calgary stampede i got to start concentrating on driving
5621826 its a team thing its tough to get into this sport without a family
5621827 usually youre unlucky enough to have eight through a whole summer
5621828 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
5621829 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
5621830 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
5621831 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
5621832 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
5621833 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
5621834 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
5621835 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
5621836 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
5621837 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
5621838 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
5621839 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
5621840 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention

5621844 i was going to quit but instead of quitting i decided to go over there to the cpca for a year
5621845 i wanted to go to new venues meet new people and show the people my face instead of on tv its been great so far
5621846 in the wpca youve just got more top end competitors
5621847 the cpca still has lots of good drivers and lots of tough drivers but theres a few more of them in the wpca

5621870 if i look at this beautiful cathedral it is a living proclamation it speaks to us itself and on the basis of the cathedrals beauty we succeed in visibly proclaiming god christ and all his mysteries here they have acquired a form and look at us all the great works of art cathedrals the gothic cathedrals and the splendid baroque churches they are all a luminous sign of god and therefore truly a manifestation an epiphany of god and in christianity it is precisely a matter of this epiphany that god became a veiled epiphany he appears and is resplendent we have just heard the organ in its full splendour i think the great music born in the church makes the truth of our faith audible and perceivable from gregorian chant to the music of the cathedrals to palestrina and his epoch to bach and hence to mozart and bruckner and so forth in listening to all these works the passions of bach his mass in b flat and the great spiritual compositions of 16th century polyphony of the viennese school of all music even that of minor composers we suddenly understand it is true
5621871 buka aku pipie berapa lama aku harus jadi temanmu kalau suaraku aja ngga bisa kau kenal
5621872 sialan kalau mau cepat mati ngga usah ngajak ngajak teman dong mati aja sendiri
5621873 waduh kok berantakan amat sih ngga malu pula kalau ada tamu
5621874 ah menurutku lukisannya biasa biasa aja malah banyak yang ngga proporsional kaya pohon itu kan terlalu besar kelihatannya pantulan tebing di danaunya ngga mirip malah ngga sama terlalu tinggi juga tebingnya yah lukisanmu ini sama kaya lukisanmu yang lain ngga bertambah bagus norak dan terlalu kontras
5621875 itu kalau kau menceritakan keadaan lukisan saat itu yang aku komentari kan bukan ceritanya tapi struktur dan komposisi lukisanmu masa di sana sini terjadi kesalahan ukuran kau kan pelukis naturalis jadi menurutku ukuran suatu objek mesti seimbang dengan objek lain
5621876 yah temen temen yang lain juga bilang gitu kok jadi ngga baru buatku
5621877 christ aku ngomong samamu bisa berhenti ngga sih sebentar aja
5621878 kita udah ngomongin ini sejak lama aku ngga suka kalau kau terus terusan kaya gini
5621879 christ apa sih yang ngga ku buat samamu aku lakuin semua buatmu kenapa kau ngga ngasih aku kesempatan jadi seorang yang lebih di hidupmu
5621880 jangan bilang bilang itu lagi ya aku ngga suka yah aku memang kaya gini kenapa kau malah merepotkan diri untuk mengurusku aku sudah cukup senang kok dengan keadaanku dari dulu sampai sekarang jadi aku ngga bisa jadi pacarmu maaf ya kan masih ada yang lain teman teman di kampus kita sama roy jeffri atau yang lain kek ngga mesti aku kan
5621881 lagian apa yang kau harapkan dariku coba ngga ada kan kalau sama yang lain kau bisa senang senang nonton bioskop jalan jalan makan malam semua itu ngga kan bisa kau dapat kalau kau pacaran samaku dan tentu saja mereka terang terangan bilang kalau suka sama kau kan ngga usah repot repot lagi
5621882 tapi aku udah memahamimu aku coba selalu ada untukmu saat kau di opname karena kecelakaan itu siapa yang jagain kau di rumah sakit saat kau butuh uang untuk kuliah lalu uang kirimanmu belum datang siapa yang bantu aku kan
5621883 oh kau mau jadi pacarku karena alasan itu ya kau mau jadi pacarku hanya untuk berkorban buatku kok aneh apa aku harus membayar semua kebaikanmu selama ini dengan jadi pacarmu kau gila rupanya buat apa kalau aku ngga suka samamu sedikitpun
5621884 kau jahat aku tak tahu lagi harus bilang apa samamu aku udah pernah bilang dan selalu bilang kalau aku sayang kau tapi alasan tulus itu ngga kau acuhkan apa yang harus kubuat untukmu sebagai alasannya lukisan itu itu yang terus mempengaruhimu
5621885 ini sama sekali tak ada hubungannya dengan hobiku aku kenal melukis jauh sebelum aku kenal kau jadi jangan kau bawa bawa lukisanku tolong
5621886 ayo jawab apa yang kau dapat rupanya kau jadi aneh karena lukisan ini perlakuanmu sama lukisan jadi dasar perlakuanmu sama semua orang coba kau jawab kau sama sekali tak menghargai orang lain melukis juga kan semua orang menganggap kau pelukis tak berperasaan jiwa seni apanya kau hanya melukis untuk dirimu sendiri melihat sesuatu dengan mata membuat sesuatu seperti yang kau inginkan seperti maumu saja gitu kan
5621887 kau benar aku melukis untukku aku melukis untuk kesenanganku untuk apa aku melukis untuk dilihat orang membuat orang lain senang dan puas aku melukis seindah apa yang kuanggap indah bukan untukmu atau untuk orang lain yang aku ngga kenal sama sekali
5621888 itulah yang kau lakukan juga buatku kau memperlakukanku seperti maumu dekat denganku tapi tak mengerti perasaanku seperti lukisan itu christ kalau saja dia punya hati dan mampu bicara dia pasti bilang kalau dia tak suka kau perlakukan sesuka hatimu tentu saja lukisan juga ingin dilihat orang lain dikagumi orang lain yang memandang ngga hanya dibuat apalagi orang seperti kau ini menumpuk lukisan di kamar selesai dibuat disimpan saja di bawah tempat tidur tak kau rawat sama sekali mereka pasti nangis christ kalau mereka bisa
5621889 tolong hargai sedikit saja perhatianku samamu kau membuatku iba tapi aku ngga mau dianggap kasihan samamu aku selalu ada buatmu christ seperti kuasmu atau kanvasmu itu selalu ada untukmu membantumu membuat lukisan tempatmu mengadu menunjukkan keadaan hatimu setiap saat kau mau tapi bukannya kau hargai malah kau campakkan ke bawah tempat tidur tertumpuk berdebu ngga pernah sekalipun kau rawat dan gitu jugalah christ kau perlakukan aku
5621890 aku juga ngga mau maksain kok buat apa aku cuma mau nyadarin aja kalau sikapmu sama semua lukisanmu itu sama halnya perlakuanmu samaku ngga berperasaan sedikitpun ngga
5621891 kalau saja aku bisa menyadarkanmu betapa aku sayang samamu saat kau senang atau sedih sekalipun tapi kau tak menghargaiku aku juga benci kenapa aku sayang kaya ini samamu christ kalau saja bisa aku ngga mau terus terusan menunggumu hanya menunggumu
5621892 aku lelah christ aku mesti jalani hidupku kan ngga semestinya aku mengerti kalau nyatanya hanya aku yang berusaha tapi ngga kau pedulikan aku juga sadar kalau aku salah mengharapkanmu selama ini tapi kita masih teman kok tapi ngga kaya dulu lagi aku ngga bisa selalu ada buatmu aku pulang dulu ya jam 2 siang aku harus masuk kampus maaf tadi aku membentakmu aku khilaf permisi
5621893 jonal went out and had a great season out of nowhere he just decided he was going to be a great player and there was nothing i could do
5621894 it was best for the team which is fine but absolutely it does motivate you to want to be a better player to want the same type of thing to happen to you to help your team out hopefully ill have a similar result
5621895 he made a little comment to me in the offseason which was a little funny i was really getting after him pretty good about a couple things and he said coach it seems like youre on me quite a bit and i said last year you were a backup this year youre a starter that comes with the territory
5621896 that woke him up and he realized what i was trying to do was motivate him to become a better player hes really had a good offseason and i look for brandon to have a good year this year
5621897 brandons just an athletic freak he squatted like 600 pounds
5621898 hes playing with a lot more confidence and technique than he was last year he doesnt realize it but im around him all the time and i realize hes going to explode this year
5621899 we had the blahs after a tough home stand 4 6 capped by sundays 16 8 loss and we hung in there and got it done
5621900 the only thing i care about that ive ever done
5621901 its a park where you never whats going to happen and pitching here is for a whole season is extremely difficult mentally and physically
5621902 if you want to be a little pumped up because its your former team thats good i understand that and i dont have any problem with that
5621903 but to me hell make the biggest mistake of his life if he takes the mound trying to show the rangers they made a mistake
5621904 and thats kind of tough because we dont know about bonderman we dont know about willis we dont know about zumaya
5621905 weve got to do a better job of pitching to people our scouting reports have been excellent brandons next step in returning to catching will be to get adjusted to all our pitchers then get a feel for what he sees during the game
5621906 take for instance carlos quentin from the white sox twice he burned us this season with two strikes on balls low and away when he was shortened up and diving out over the plate no one recognized that we needed to pound the fastball in with two strikes little things like that
5621907 i thought it would take an injury for me to be back on that squad and that wasnt something i wanted to root for or have happen
5621908 and if i wasnt called up until september then most likely i wouldnt be on the playoff roster and the only pride id have in staying with them would be to be on the playoff roster
5621909 when i said granderson might catch crawford for the league lead i didnt mean tonight
5621910 weve got to stay physical and weve got to run the ball
5621911 weve just got to keep making that investment and just keep hammering in there
5621912 were a track team out there we have to tackle when were supposed to tackle and hammer the run when were supposed to
5621913 today in accordance with the decision of the president of the russian federation the disengagement of troops from the areas temporarily held by the units of the russian armed forces has begun
5621914 increased subversive and terrorist activities against russian troops and south ossetian civilians were recorded
5621915 they have never been stopped and are on the increase now
5621916 the situation in the russian peacekeepers responsibility zones is under their full control providing favorable conditions for the disengagement of the troops to the designated areas
5621917 we are fully aware that the georgian side is capable of carrying out provocations toward our troops and civilians at any moment
5621918 if somebody thinks that he can with impunity murder our citizens murder our soldiers and officers who are peacekeepers we will never allow this
5621919 all those who try to do something like that will get a crushing response
5621920 we have all possibilities for this economic political and military
5621921 now it is essentially important to restore order and discipline in the republic
5621922 a novel that since its publication in 1932 has probably been read by only two people namely james wood and joseph roth
5621923 in recent years the trend in ya fiction has been toward a proliferation of darker edgier fare aimed at a more mature audience
5621924 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected
5621925 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf
5621926 the vermont college writers community is so caring and the faculty amazing you cant help but dig in

5621928 hopefully well finally beat them in a series they have beat us three series in a row
5621929 what is incontestable is that the country must move on from this crisis quickly
5621930 but the departure of mr musharraf even while denying all charges levelled against him in the impeachment charge sheet also brings with it hope
5621931 insightful leadership political wisdom and can live up to the task of guiding the country onwards along the path of progress
5621932 staying on in power beyond five or six years is simply not an option
5621933 the country doesnt have the right software in terms of the rule of law and constitutional government for us
5621934 im definitely a little upset you know i was hoping i could get another gold

5621941 this spiral has to be nipped in the bud and that means having interest rates at a suitable level until the threat of higher inflation has passed
5621942 all being well inflation will fall again next year and will be much closer to the two percent target by the end of 2009 but that will only happen if people dont chase inflationary wage increases
5621943 the reality is that new zealand has many beautiful spots and this bay while wonderful could be a teensy bit overhyped
5621944 yet the subtropical tip of the north island has more breathtaking coastline per square kilometre than anywhere but the offshore islands
5621945 awesome beaches a world away from the glitzy face presented for tourists in the bay of islands
5621946 in the wild newborn dogfish are at risk from a variety of predators including adults of their own species
5621947 so this salmon like ability is probably a valuable defence mechanism
5621948 i was amazed id never heard of dogfish doing anything like this and no one else ive talked to has ever seen it before
5621949 within the space of about 20 minutes all six had jumped out again

5621953 i guess theyre going to hitch their wagon to him and just ride him off into the sunset
5621954 i always knew he was a good athlete but most pitchers lets be honest cant hit he can swing the bat a little bit i just wish i could have hit some home runs in front of him instead of making him run like that
5621955 i was just looking for something out over the plate trying to put a good swing on it put it in play
5621956 he threw me a curveball and i was able to flip it to left
5621957 ive got to tip my cap because it was a slider down and away i looked at the video 100 times and ill probably see it 100 times when im not sleeping tonight he really helped himself out there its frustrating when something like that happens
5621958 it was a little awkward but i was just trying to get in scoring position
5621959 i like to hit but i think since ive been here the more i hit the worse ive been getting
5621960 hes definitely confident in his hitting abilities and for the right reason hes a good hitter
5621961 cyber bullying is not under any definition trespass or theft
5621962 cyber bullying is a relatively new phenomenon as is social networking
5621963 it is therefore not surprising that there have been relatively few prosecutions in this area
5621964 as a tool to address all manner of cyber crimes
5621965 moreover the vehicle for the cyber bullying at issue here a social networking web site only became mainstream after 2000
5621966 invites a host of difficult thorny problems and unwanted results
5621967 i would choose john terry 100 i always have and i always will i went on record before the last world cup that i thought he should have got it then
5621968 he would have been my captain then and nothing has changed since for me he is a great leader a great man and a great footballer
5621969 i have nothing against stevie gerrard who i had the pleasure of playing with on his debut or rio
5621970 they are both great players but john terry can organise it and lead better than anyone else why has he not already chosen him

5621980 esos juicios fueron claramente injustos y ahora sud n se prepara para juzgar a m s personas con este sistema es eso justicia

5621984 mit blick auf die konjunkturelle entwicklung und die steigenden lebenshaltungskosten fordern wir die abschaffung des solidarit tszuschlags anstelle der derzeit diskutierten ma nahmen wie r ckkehr zur alten pendlerpauschale oder ausweitung der reduzierten mehrwertsteuer als zweites wichtiges signal fordern wir die weitere senkung der sozialbeitr ge damit w rden auch die b rger in die entlastungen einbezogen die keine oder nur geringe steuern bezahlen

5621991 the resulting clamour damaged him it meant sadly that the final public and media view of harold wilson in action was besmirched and did not give credit to the remarkable achievements of his political career
5621992 the time has come for others to consider their own response to the tragic conflict of loyalties with which i have myself wrestled for perhaps too long

5622001 the u s mint buys direct from the refiners and this suspension of gold eagle sales may be an indication that the supply line is already backing up or that the mint expects that it will back up for the rest of the year i wonder who would give up physical metal at these prices and under these circumstances except distressed sellers the central banks are in a hunker down mode as far as i can determine and its the mines that supply the refiners so if the mint which buys from the refiners is having a difficult time locating metal what does that tell you i keep saying that we may get a surprising rubber band effect later in the year when the pre holiday festival season kicks off in september october it may happen sooner one of our indicators of approaching a bottom in gold is how many calls centennial precious metals gets from our u s based indian clientele heres a quote from my offices report to me at the end of the day today today was a good day there must have been an indian convention where someone was handing out usagold business cards that may give you a clue as to thinking in india proper and probably the rest of the asian rim

5622021 were seeing that when these ceramic flat irons are used at the highest heat settings and on a daily basis to achieve straight hair they can really take a toll on the structure of the hair and cause very noticeable problems that can be hard to repair
5622022 if you look at the sales statistics you see that people are pursuing straighter hair with more vigour
5622023 most people on tv and in films have straight hair and its a trend the public is trying to emulate
5622024 the problem starts when they do it wrong or too frequently and they cause a real mess that takes a long time to fix

5622033 unfortunately the labor party cant even agree to dig uranium out of the ground and sell it to the rest of the world he said
5622034 weve had the labor party and prime minister kevin rudd for some ridiculously stupid reason refusing to sell uranium to india to help its domestic nuclear power industry
5622035 my view is we will need both sides of politics thats the labor the liberal and national parties to jointly support the development of a nuclear power industry
5622036 we need more rational discussion about nuclear power in australia and much less of the emotive political debate weve had in the last few years

5622080 what is heartening on that question is that both candidates have indicated that they will be moving on this and with an ambitious set of targets
5622081 many of the developed industrialised countries are not very keen on coming forward with strong commitments post 2012 without knowing what the us is doing
5622082 we could do some practical good work at this stage
5622083 if i could be the dictator of the world it would come out as minus 30 that would be what we should aim for for 2020

5622105 well actually we are going to go on all platforms but we will come out on pc first we will even come out on cell phones and stuff one of the things in the game is that as you go around and encounter things creatures and plants or whatever you make trading cards of each thing that is the metaphor for the database trading cards so you can collect your cards you can print them out you can now play your own card game that might be like the cell phone part that stuff is so light its more about collectability as opposed to interaction every creature in the pc game is three or four megabytes but the cards that is the database that the player is building

5622107 how much fun can it be when you dont have the ball
5622108 as a result we decided to compete in quality not size
5622109 if you play team fortress 2 thats a great example they have a small number of maps and some of them are remakes but the quality is so high
5622110 players expect more than before the game is already half done right but most sequels have less development time and indeed we didnt get much pre production time its really hard to eke out pre production time for a sequel the lesson is to compete in novelty not size
5622111 one have the best guns two have the most guns three sell guns
5622112 sorry if there is anyone from switzerland in the audience but what i mean is just stay out of the war and do your own thing and expect it will work out

5622127 were still working through exactly how we want to price and what price we want to put to consumers but i think it would be fair to say our roaming prices will come down
5622128 this is the latest in a long line of attacks on churches church halls mission halls and orange halls in the mid ulster area and i have been consistent in my condemnation of all such attacks there most be no hiding place for those scoundrels who would attack any place of worship of any denomination
5622129 it is clear to me that there is a pattern here in which property which is perceived to symbolise the protestant community is regarded as fair game for attack
5622130 as i have said before this is completely unacceptable every community and faith has the right to live free from attack and intimidation an attack on one faith is an attack on us all and i would call upon anyone with information to make it available to the police so that they can catch the culprits and bring them before the courts
5622131 it has been brought to my attention that farmers who are signing up for a second five years of the countryside management scheme are being offered the same rate of grant for example double fencing with new restored hedge remains at 10 per metre however costs of wire posts tractor fuel have all risen to push contractor charges above the available rate this can even be the case when a farmer plants a hedge themselves as many often do
5622132 on the flip side those farmers who are signing up for the new scheme are being offered much higher rates for grants which take into account the increase in running costs while i have nothing against the farmers who are getting the higher amounts we do want to see equality across the board it cant be right for some farmers to get more money simply because they applied after others who face the same challenges day in day out in relation to costs
5622133 by way of resolving this issue i believe that the inclusion of an annual review of inflation costs upon which rates of grant would be set would allow for equality among the farmers who apply for the scheme for example the review could take place every two years with any rise of fall in inflation accounted for meaning that grants could be altered as necessary
5622134 there needs to be some serious changes made green haslost the markets confidence so if he goes i guess that isprobably a step in the right direction
5622135 the issue is that there is concern about the value of itsunderlying satellite investments the level of gearingassociated with the overall group
5622136 at a glance the t shirt that is being sold on the sinn fein website would pass as a typical piece of clothing only with the words in irish however after stumbling across the product and enlarging the image i realised that the basis for the design appears to have come from a logo belonging to guinness while whoever designed the t shirt had cunningly removed the registered symbols a capital r within a circle which highlights the copyright belonging to diageo the famous harp symbol was the same as is synonymous with the guinness brand across the world
5622137 when i saw the harp i knew immediately that something was amiss and after comparing the t shirt and the guinness logo i had my staff contact diageo immediately to make them aware
5622138 he requested me as a friend on facebook that was the highlight of my day
5622139 they say im having to work so hard to breathe im just going to give up and sit around in a wheelchair

5622142 sensitivity to this belief will promote development of a trusting relationship
5622143 when youre a parent and youre standing over the body of your child who you think is dying you have to have that
5622144 we need the elements of secrecy to try to be ahead of the game
5622145 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5622146 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5622147 over the year we will not see the same kind ofdouble digit momentum that we saw in the first quarter we aremore likely to be talking about single digit growth for theindustry
5622148 continuing worries about a u s economy slowdown which may spread to the euro zone and perhaps also asia are weighing down on oil pricing
5622149 in the near term there will be a lot of downward pressure but i dont foresee a fast collapse of pricing to 100 a barrel or below there is still strong support at 110 a barrel level because of supply side issues
5622150 hes an icon here in china he has a very bright future
5622151 if anybody takes a hit from it its certainly nike simply because theyre all about performance whereas the others are about brand image
5622152 nikes all about you dont win silver you lose gold with that attitude its much tougher for them because he was certainly the cornerstone for their program
5622153 whenever he goes out he sees his own picture in the streets
5622154 we will continue to count on liu xiang as an ambassador for our company and our brand because his achievements both on and off the field will continue to inspire fans and consumers throughout china
5622155 its about picking yourself up when youre down and coming back stronger
5622156 i can count on one hand the number of people here with any kind of crop this year
5622157 but growers are the ultimate optimists hopefully well have a good crop next year
5622158 i dont care if youre making spark plugs or olives you need a constant flow into the market
5622159 we cant build a market and then say we dont have any olives this year
5622160 compared to the last two years this is a pleasant change of pace
5622161 this would be considered an average to slightly above average crop and a night and day difference from the last two years
5622162 we are seeing the beginnings of the internet flu instead of mega killer pandemics we have these recurring infections that are not very dangerous in and of itself but pervasive hard to identify and stamp out

5622165 as you can imagine you get different types of hoaxes that are targeted at cellphone users we try to monitor them and put them on record for future purposes
5622166 customers have to be aware and should not give out their personal details like banking and id numbers to anyone on the telephone
5622167 when you do receive such calls ask for some type of proof and take down their phone number and their details but do not give them any personal details
5622168 the most harmful aspect of this situation is the perceptions about mtn that may be created by the media and the public

5622188 hindalco industries is an excellent metals company but currently commodities are seeing a downtrend largely on the basis of the fact that probably the demand is slipping down although it produces aluminium as well as copper and aluminium would account for something like 40 of the turnover copper would be around 60 but aluminium continues to be the cash cow when it comes to the ebitda earnings which accounts for something like 90 which come out of aluminium

5622190 the rate of users with internet access is rising exponentially in fact we haven t seen such growth since 2000
5622191 the recent incidents by standard bank s internet banking experiencing downtime in june and july for example was said to be blown out of proportion by consumers and the media according to the bank however situations like this can no longer be downplayed
5622192 bandwidth will go from a luxury as it stands now to a commodity
5622193 online media has a fairly good idea of where it is going
5622194 the advertising industry has woken up as it moves more and more away from traditional media there is an estimated r650 million predicted to be spent on online advertising by 2010
5622195 if you look at what distinguishes an sme from a corporate in terms of it needs smes are lacking from a knowledge perspective a corporate invariably has an it manager director cio and 20 or 30 it staff when we deal with such customers they know what technology they want and where they re buying it from all they want is an operating lease
5622196 they do not have the luxury of investing resources in those areas they typically invest in sales and operational executives what s left over goes to admin and it is last
5622197 with an sme customer we start with the basics they deal with technology needs reactively they don t know what they require where to get it how to get it or how to structure it to meet their needs
5622198 sme specific software has upgrade paths that can grow with a business making it more efficient as opposed to using enterprise software where the strengths quickly become an sme nightmare training on scaled down products is also not comprehensive or complete enough making the challenges even greater
5622199 what if the particular whistle that has been left out is one the sme needs and what if there are still features in the lite version that the sme can easily do without
5622200 take a low end sme with a receptionist who also does invoicing these people never know what s a debit or a credit and they shouldn t have to the attitude from vendors has always been that you need a bookkeeper the guys should have said no i don t have one and your software should be easy enough to use that i don t need one
5622201 the guys are going back to excel where they can make corrections anyway if we don t give them software they can use they opt out of accounting software completely
5622202 it s a combination of licensing costs the difficulty in supporting managing and maintaining it correctly hardware costs exchange 2007 requires 64 bit architecture and the eco system around it exchange requires active directory and a domain controller
5622203 open source alternatives don t need this and can run as standalones on older hardware and give the same functionality also not all smes require collaboration functionality with the majority of oss collaboration solutions the licensing model says that if don t need the full suite you don t license the bits you don t need
5622204 a few are looking at accounting or erp packages but erp is not big in the sme space i think smes don t see the benefits it s too complex for small organisations to run
5622205 the main thing smes are looking for is good e mail and collaboration software shared mail calendaring a place to put files and share them a big thing we are starting to see demand for is central log in and good smme security network gateways and backups
5622206 we see a lot of smes that have been given bad advice in the past and are running white box cheapies and now realising that it makes sense to use enterprise stuff in their environments they re buying brand name servers because they get better value in the long run we re seeing a lot of them realise that enterprise technology can fit into their budget and environment a lot of time it s pure education
5622207 smes just think they can t afford or use enterprise technologies
5622208 it s not just a matter of filling in and signing a form
5622209 we want to make sure they understand the programme that their product runs on ibm and that both parties agree to their signing up to the express advantage programme too

5622213 i had a strong feeling last weekend when john edwards finally acknowledged having an extramarital affair that we hadnt heard the end of this thing
5622214 just days before the start of the democratic convention in denver which will culminate in the crowning of barack obama are we in fact seeing the early outlines of a first rate political cover up
5622215 based on who i really am not based on some plastic ken doll
5622216 being in love with a still somewhat dysfunctional married man
5622217 edwards hired her as a front to continue their relationship
5622218 he said he said he just couldnt live with the constant pounding from the tabloids
5622219 admitted the national enquirer was correct when it reported he had visited hunter at the beverly hills hilton last month
5622220 keep this mistake i had made two years previously private
5622221 saiid it was possible some of his friends or supporters may have made payments without telling him
5622222 you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
5622223 if there is not an explanation thats satisfactory acceptable and meets high moral standards the answer is no he would not be a prime candidate to make a major address to the convention
5622224 obviously the convention has not been our driving force behind the story
5622225 perel pauses if the convention wasnt part of the timetable before it is now
5622226 praying that tomorrow will not be as cold as today because she doesnt have the coat to keep her warm
5622227 ok were not hiring him because of his sterling private behavior
5622228 disappearing from the national stage unless he finds a way to squelch this story fast
5622229 a super rich pal who was closely involved with the campaign finances
5622230 this isnt something you would normally see in a newspaper more than once we already wrote the one post quoting the national enquirer which slipped out before pierces ban kf and i dont think youd see more than that if there were no blogs and this was just a newspaper
5622231 its a story that were taking a long view of
5622232 weve got a big exclusive coming out this week and we are on the trail of some stuff thats even hotter
5622233 not about the photos but about the rest of the story and the story is just going to get bigger from here
5622234 everythings done incrementally so im not going to tell you exactly what our process is perhaps my time frame is different than your time frame im not worried about the rest of the media im worried about us
5622235 if you had this rumor about bill clinton it probably wouldnt cause a ripple
5622236 but given john edwards and his public relationship with his wife something close to a model of the perfect family and their perfect relationship it would hurt that much more
5622237 opponents of affirmative action are trying to get a referendum on the ballot here that would do away with affirmative action do you support that
5622238 yes i do i do not believe in quotas but i have not seen the details of some of the proposals but ive always opposed quotas
5622239 i do not have a firm enough grasp on the historical and relevant context of mccains remark in 1998 to give you the pushback that this question deserves
5622240 within minutes of posting yesterday i recognized that it was indeed heavyhanded and had it unpublished
5622241 i may be identifying with elizabeth a little too closely as an oversharing cancer survivor and all
5622242 we dont want to get it at all not even just a mention of the allegation not even second
5622243 edwards isnt considered a likely vice presidential candidate by the press
5622244 its so easy to jump to conclusions and i admit this looks bad
5622245 if the account of him being caught in a hotel rendezvous with rielle hunter was false edwards wouldnt be changing the subject hed be suing
5622246 which story gets a bigger audience a story the blogs run with but the mainstream news ignores or a story the news runs with but the blogs ignore im thinking the news comes out ahead but just barely and at this rate not for much longer
5622247 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
5622248 will mccain respect obamas views once obama has studied the issue
5622249 supposed to be about supplying some needed capital to the subprime market
5622250 the most dangerous foreign policy blunder in this country since vietnam
5622251 im a big success and im telling you losers what to do
5622252 you are probably not that good a rapper maybe you are the next lil wayne but probably not in which case you need to stay in school
5622253 i urge you all to stay in school ive seen what happened to friends of mine i know what would have happened to me the odds against people who drop out of high school are not good
5622254 so turn off the tv set put the video game away
5622255 you need to make sure your child can speak spanish
5622256 many americans with good cause didnt believe us when we said we would secure our borders and so we failed in our efforts we must prove to them that we can and will secure our borders first while respecting the dignity and rights of citizens and legal residents of the united states of america
5622257 we resolved that matter of my campaigns structure back in july
5622258 i would bet my firstborn that they will be excluded from the accounting change it would bankrupt them
5622259 unhappy california business won the support of mayor antonio r villaraigosa of los angeles who wrote a letter
5622260 the federal system to check the working papers of new hires
5622261 i find comfort in the fact that the longer im in politics the less nourishing popularity becomes that a striving for rank and fame seems to betray a poverty of ambition and that i am answerable mainly to the steady gaze of my own conscience
5622262 i dont think mccain can afford to do any more major reshuffling without running the risk of key republicans concluding that hes hopeless and abandoning him en masse
5622263 a mid size sports sedan for 60 000 a competitor to the bmw 5 series and jaguar xf
5622264 it would be my top priority yesterday today and tomorrow
5622265 but we also must proceed with a temporary worker program that is verifiable and truly temporary
5622266 in increasingly strident terms his commitment to legalizing all the illegal aliens
5622267 i dont want you to take out of context what i said during the campaign
5622268 s peaking to reporters aboard his campaign plane obama said the actress doesnt have his personal email address
5622269 she sent one email to reggie who forwarded it to me
5622270 i write saying thank you scarlett for doing what you do and suddenly we have this email relationship
5622271 i feel like im supporting someone and having a personal dialogue with them and its amazing
5622272 failed to generate the kind of republican primary turnout typically enjoyed by house incumbents
5622273 keep a more progressive social security program from being seen as welfare
5622274 does a work test keep the eitc from being seen as welfare
5622275 the eitc has fared much better than welfare programs without a work test
5622276 then he said i bet some of you dont know this did you know spanish was spoken in arizona before english
5622277 i didnt call him i called my friend who happened to be with him at the time
5622278 black fathers who arent in the home are much more likely to sustain regular contact with their children than absentee white fathers or for that matter fathers of any other ethnic group
5622279 obama is the greatest nothing this great has happened to us in a long time the only thing we have to worry about is what well have to wear to the inauguration
5622280 hey were contributing all this money but not getting much back in benefits so the hell with this system
5622281 hey this is to help old folks whove worked all their lives
5622282 he stayed for a good almost half hour afterwards shaking hands listening to our concerns talking to us
5622283 pointed out that he supported bill clinton with both ginsberg sic and breyer
5622284 we have seen this before there is dirt and lies that are circulated in e mails and they pump them out long enough until finally you a mainstream reporter asks me about it
5622285 it will only produce an immediate 17 increase in immigration
5622286 editorial staff is about two thirds its size in the late 1990s
5622287 on the board of five companies that granted lavish pay packages to their executives
5622288 dell makes it easy to migrate to vista on your schedule
5622289 lets see how about never that fits my schedule t
5622290 youd imagine that someone like the senator who is constantly traveling and constantly on how can he return these personal e mails
5622291 done a brilliant job of insulating itself for the down cycle
5622292 obama aides also said clinton is in no position to stiffen oversight after taking contributions from mortgage industry lobbyists including funds from representatives of countrywide which has been at the center of the mortgage meltdown
5622293 im glad to report that starbucks is indeed considering some sort of elite status
5622294 we dont comment on campaigns that are utter and complete failures
5622295 you find you can eliminate a fair number of people without eliminating much content
5622296 supported by fed chairman alan greenspan and treasury secretary larry summers
5622297 but we must enact comprehensive immigration reform we must make it a top agenda item if we dont do it before and we probably wont a little straight talk as of january 2009
5622298 mr mccain has made some gains in reassuring conservatives nervous about his views on issues like immigration polls suggest
5622299 there were not all of these pundits and bloggers and everything who were all over it
5622300 you bloggers do a great job digging up stories for us in the msm keep it up
5622301 on a message to balance the crazy left wing things a president obama is sure to try
5622302 what it says is that im not very well known in that part of the country
5622303 sen clinton i think is much better known coming from a nearby state of arkansas so its not surprising that she would have an advantage in some of those states in the middle
5622304 last time i checked illinois was more nearby kentucky than arkansas heck they even touch
5622305 i snt there something a tad condescending in his reference to
5622306 stephen is highly regarded within the media sector and i have been impressed with his achievements within the newspaper industry over many years and in particular the innovative and exciting developments he has brought to the mail on sunday
5622307 i have no doubt that his drive along with his commercial and management experience will enhance our business and i look forward to him joining the company
5622308 we now have the right management balance to drive the business forward and ensure that global and its radio brands lead the industry
5622309 ashley tabors vision of creating the largest commercial radio business within the uk has now become a reality and i look forward to joining his company at this very exciting time
5622310 cyber bullying is not under any definition trespass or theft
5622311 cyber bullying is a relatively new phenomenon as is social networking
5622312 it is therefore not surprising that there have been relatively few prosecutions in this area
5622313 as a tool to address all manner of cyber crimes
5622314 moreover the vehicle for the cyber bullying at issue here a social networking web site only became mainstream after 2000
5622315 invites a host of difficult thorny problems and unwanted results
5622316 most anybody when they leave their country their first choice would be to go back home if they could
5622317 if you look at these groups coming here theyre among the most unlikely to go back and those having the most trouble
5622318 because we have the arabic speaking community and new jersey has a lot of diversity we do get them here

5622323 eso era todo lo que quer a hacer estar con mi mam y mis hermanas y ver a algunos de mis amigos que vinieron a darme aliento
5622324 simplemente quer a relajarme divertirme sentarme por ah y no hacer nada
5622325 no s a d nde estoy yendo o lo que estoy haciendo simplemente voy a donde me llevan
5622326 creo que va de la mano con mis objetivos de elevar los est ndares de la nataci n

5622329 if team gb remains ahead of australia come the end of the olympics there will be renewed enthusiasm for an australian republic and they will take the queens head off the stamps
5622330 watching their celebrations watching how great it makes them feel that transfers on to us as well and we feel part of it
5622331 when we listen to the commentaries its the gb team and how well we are doing and that use of language draws us into it and makes us feel part of it
5622332 i suspect it will be a temporary thing its not going to substantially affect a nationalist movement in scotland or wales
5622333 this might be a good time to push out our chest and lift our head above the barriers
5622334 i had 16 years at the highest level and only three of those werent quite so glorious
5622335 i learnt a lot over there it wasnt always rosy but i got to play on a day to day basis with some amazing players i got to know zinedine zidane in turin and that was great
5622336 thats my greatest team memory its a title recognised around the world and it was the first one in the competition for an african team
5622337 my goal against spain in 1998 on top of everything it was the decider it gave us the win everyone still remembers it now
5622338 at the 1994 caf africa cup of nations i was one of the best players
5622339 after that i went to italy before experiencing the best season of my career at cologne where i was voted best defensive midfielder in the german championship
5622340 i had a fabulous time there we did the double in 1998 and went on to win the cup again the following season we played good football too it was the best
5622341 starting in the top division wasnt an obsession for me ive known the highest level and as a coach i enjoy myself just training my son
5622342 the team is young so well see what happens in two or three years
5622343 more of a whiney british asshole than an actual bastard
5622344 ask anyone who saw the guru that guy is a complete and utter bastard
5622345 i mean come on death proof anyone who sat through the directors cut of that shit pile knows what kind of bastard i am
5622346 no way that guy is beyond a bastard i mean come on were not making inglorious c ts here
5622347 if youre one of the many developers who were waiting for something a bit more mature
5622348 this might be a good time to take another look
5622349 the beta sdk that were releasing today is the first big step on the sdks road to compatibility with 1 0
5622350 since this is a beta release applications developed with it may not quite be compatible with devices running the final android 1 0 however the apis are now pretty stable and we dont expect any major changes
5622351 since were now moving quickly toward 1 0 it may also help to know which direction were headed to help out weve also prepared a this will be a living document and well keep it up to date as the android landscape evolves currently it covers the next few months roughly through the end of the year and a bit into next year well update it with additional detail as we are able to but even right now it can help give you a picture of how things will play out as the first phones draw near enough of that though youre probably wondering whats actually new in the sdk well you should read the api delta report for all the details but here are a few highlights first and most obviously the new home screen is included along with a ton of ui changes for 1 0 some new applications are included an alarm clock calculator camera music player picture viewer and messaging for sms mms conversations several new development tools were added such as a graphical preview for xml layouts for users of eclipse and a tool for constructing 9 patch images since weve got a new home screen application now we thought the now obsolete version from the m5 early look sdk might be helpful to developers so its source is included as a sample a number of new apis are fleshed out and improved and others are now close to their final forms for 1 0 tons of bugs were fixed of course if you had problems with the mediaplayer try it now there are a lot of changes the ones in the list above are just my personal favorites so you should check out the links above for the full story not all the changes are additions though im sorry to say that we had to remove a few things such as the gtalkservice for security reasons and the bluetooth api theres a bit more detail in the links above and well follow up on those in particular here in this blog to give you the scoop in fact weve got a little list of topics we want to talk about here so stay tuned
5622352 the important thing for all of the philippines is to find the right framework for lasting peace in mindanao
5622353 and im hopeful that that would be the focus and the violence that is currently destroying lives and property and taking away the prospect of peace and prosperity would go away
5622354 were not going to walk away just because there have been a few bad days
5622355 you all know we have bent as far backward as possible to give peace a chance
5622356 if they keep on saying that line and they continue to fail controlling them milf sub commanders then the government will certainly control them
5622357 but that is all right she takes care of her old parents and sends her brothers and sisters to college
5622358 there are no notable differences between children raised by straight or gay parents
5622359 its truly sad that the catholic hierarchy condemns homosexual acts when it has treated its erring gay priests and lesbian nuns who figured in molestation rape sexual harassment cases with kid gloves if there are closeted gay clergy who engage in homosexual practices what does that make of the catholic hierarchy that condemns homosexuality i think it only makes the church look ridiculous
5622360 there are some gay priests hiding in the confessional boxes afraid to come out in the open what we get from the newspaper headlines are only a few isolated cases most of the young and helpless victims are afraid to speak out yet we hear of condemnation of gays high up in the pulpit

5622366 se trata del mayor incremento interanual de los precios desde octubre de 1981 cuando los precios aumentaron un 9 1 por ciento

5622368 she went for tests and results have come back and she has cancer
5622369 she was phoned up and informed this is a massive blow for her
5622370 most anybody when they leave their country their first choice would be to go back home if they could
5622371 if you look at these groups coming here theyre among the most unlikely to go back and those having the most trouble
5622372 because we have the arabic speaking community and new jersey has a lot of diversity we do get them here
5622373 well have muslim and christian refugees too so we hope the community will welcome everyone
5622374 it took a little while to get the plans out and just how we were going to do this
5622375 a year ago we didnt even have the equipment to move to the units
5622376 one of humanitys great conquests is indeed the overcoming of racism unfortunately however there are new and worrying examples of this in various countries often linked to social and economic problems that nonetheless can never justify contempt or racial discrimination
5622377 and therefore also to italy where sorry to say there are many signs of racism that trouble us and which cannot be hidden

5622379 we have not seen any significant russian movement out of georgia today
5622380 whether i win or lose the impeachment the nation will lose
5622381 weve said for years that musharraf is our best bet and my fear is that we are about to discover how true that was
5622382 you can sit here and tell your friends that this didnt happen but you know it did
5622383 but i forgive you and i do pray you will ask for forgiveness god has something more for you
5622384 he requested me as a friend on facebook that was the highlight of my day
5622385 they say im having to work so hard to breathe im just going to give up and sit around in a wheelchair
5622386 he can have the quality of life of a normal person
5622387 we are a religiously pluralistic state there are many kinds of people who have to live together in california and i think the court framed this decision to make crystal clear that all patients must receive equal services regardless of the reason that an individual health care practitioner might have for wanting to turn people away
5622388 do the rights of religious freedom and free speech as guaranteed in both the federal and the california constitutions exempt a medical clinics physicians from complying with the california unruh civil rights acts prohibition against discrimination
5622389 californias compelling interest in ensuring full and equal access to medical treatment irrespective of sexual orientation
5622390 this decision may have a big impact on californias proposition 8 the initiative to protect traditional marriage as voters begin to recognize the radical agenda of our opposition
5622391 the ruling is an important one for california and beyond because it stands for the general principle that when you engage in discriminatory conduct in this case the refusal to treat someone in a medical setting based on their sexual orientation you cant claim that conduct has first amendment protection
5622392 you are a business and as a business non discrimination laws apply to you the same way they apply to any business
5622393 this just adds fuel to that fire and underscores the urgency for cultural conservatives at winning where they can win
5622394 i wanted to create a policy that would tell everyone how we are going to go about evaluating fire stations
5622395 san jose doesnt have a good policy to determine how to close fire stations
5622396 our group is not opposed to fire station 37 per se what we are opposed to is linking 6 and 37
5622397 we proberen de speelsters te bewegen rokjes en mooiere shirts te dragen geen shirts die gemaakt zijn voor mannen maar juist die met meer vormen weergeven
5622398 if you put together a big wave with small children you get disaster
5622399 so it was really important to have this piece of legislation to regulate the wave pools
5622400 the question before us then becomes at what point do you expect people to exercise a motive of parental responsibility and common sense when going to a water park where the chief object of said water park is to enjoy the waves that it generates
5622401 i was shocked to see he is not supportive of this
5622402 i thought him being an advocate on health and everything i thought this would have been a natural thing for him to support
5622403 this is something that is going to take away from the real work that needs to be done
5622404 if any word of my speech at the rally at tourist reception centre ground has the potential to harm the unity of the freedom movement i sincerely apologise for it
5622405 the present movement is due to the joint leadership of all sections of society which includes both hurriyats

5622411 women are delaying their childbearing until they complete their educations
5622412 this is the first time weve looked at a lot of these characteristics
5622413 that to me is counter intuitive because a large share of our poor population is latino and they tend to have higher birth rates
5622414 tend to be two parent families and overwhelmingly working and because if youre undocumented youre not eligible for cash assistance programs
5622415 i couldnt go to sleep because i was really excited
5622416 but its kind of sad because my brother and all my cousins are still sleeping
5622417 when we came back from the december break the use of time was not as productive as wed like it to have been
5622418 our real job is helping them become a good citizen
5622419 nagori along with his brother karimuddin were the key trainers during the simi training camp held in kerala december 2007 and halol in gujarat january 2008
5622420 they are also key conspirators who designed and planned the terror attacks in ahmedabad they may also be involved in jaipur and hyderabad blasts
5622421 we are presently concentrating on interrogation of those arrested by us later we will bring nagori for further interrogation we believe he was instrumental in planning the blasts in ahmedabad he may have also arranged for funds to procure explosives and other materials
5622422 not to indulge in such unfair trade practice a copy of this order be also sent to director general of civil aviation for appropriate action
5622423 this contention appears to be without any substance because consumer organisations are required to take up such causes for preventing unfair trade practices and under the consumer protection act they are entitled to file such complaints
5622424 it was chance that i stumbled upon this programme while surfing the internet and was elated when i was told that i had qualified for the scholarship
5622425 emotive profiling of student in e learning and face to face lecture
5622426 in this application we profile a students emotional responses to teaching content being delivered in an e learning situation among other aspects the emotional responses can be used to change the pace of content delivery in future this work will be extended for delivery of emotionally intelligent lecturers
5622427 it has been a whole new educational experience which has given us an insight into australian society and culture the professors and students here have a more open approach

5622531 the beta sdk that were releasing today is the first big step on the sdks road to compatibility with 1 0
5622532 since this is a beta release applications developed with it may not quite be compatible with devices running the final android 1 0 however the apis are now pretty stable and we dont expect any major changes
5622533 since were now moving quickly toward 1 0 it may also help to know which direction were headed to help out weve also prepared a this will be a living document and well keep it up to date as the android landscape evolves currently it covers the next few months roughly through the end of the year and a bit into next year well update it with additional detail as we are able to but even right now it can help give you a picture of how things will play out as the first phones draw near enough of that though youre probably wondering whats actually new in the sdk well you should read the api delta report for all the details but here are a few highlights first and most obviously the new home screen is included along with a ton of ui changes for 1 0 some new applications are included an alarm clock calculator camera music player picture viewer and messaging for sms mms conversations several new development tools were added such as a graphical preview for xml layouts for users of eclipse and a tool for constructing 9 patch images since weve got a new home screen application now we thought the now obsolete version from the m5 early look sdk might be helpful to developers so its source is included as a sample a number of new apis are fleshed out and improved and others are now close to their final forms for 1 0 tons of bugs were fixed of course if you had problems with the mediaplayer try it now there are a lot of changes the ones in the list above are just my personal favorites so you should check out the links above for the full story not all the changes are additions though im sorry to say that we had to remove a few things such as the gtalkservice for security reasons and the bluetooth api theres a bit more detail in the links above and well follow up on those in particular here in this blog to give you the scoop in fact weve got a little list of topics we want to talk about here so stay tuned

5622543 the dissolution of syria and iraq into ethnically or religiously unique areas such as in lebanon is israels primary target on the eastern front
5622544 an iraqi iranian war will tear iraq apart and cause its downfall at home even before it is able to organize a struggle on a wide front against us every kind of inter arab confrontation will assist us in the short run and will shorten the way to the more important aim of breaking up iraq into denominations as in syria and lebanon
5622545 in iraq a division into provinces along ethnic religious lines as in syria during ottoman times is possible so three or more states will exist around the three major cities basra baghdad and mosul and shiite areas in the south will separate from the sunni and kurdish north
5622546 a clean break a new strategy for securing the realm
5622547 work closely with turkey and jordan to contain destabilize and roll back some of its most dangerous threats
5622548 change the nature of its relations with the palestinians including upholding the right of hot pursuit for self defense into all palestinian areas
5622549 forge a new basis for relations with the united states stressing self reliance maturity strategic cooperation on areas of mutual concern and furthering values inherent to the west
5622550 the strategic initiative along its northern borders by engaging hizballah syria and iran as the principal agents of aggression in lebanon
5622551 israel can shape its strategic environment in cooperation with turkey and jordan by weakening containing and even rolling back syria
5622552 rebuilding americas defenses strategy forces and resources for a new century
5622553 over the long term iran may well prove as large a threat to us interests in the gulf as iraq has
5622554 the united states has for decades sought to play a more permanent role in gulf regional security
5622555 the need for a substantial american force presence in the gulf transcends the issue of the regime change of saddam hussein
5622556 may be to correct the historical defect and move in stages toward a three state solution kurds in the north sunnis in the center and shiites in the south
5622557 citing the example of the break up of yugoslavia gelb stated that the americans and europeans
5622558 the first step would be to make the north and south into self governing regions with boundaries drawn as closely as possible along ethnic lines
5622559 at the same time draw down american troops in the sunni triangle and ask the united nations to oversee the transition to self government there
5622560 several islamic fundamentalist organisations including osama bin ladens al qaeda
5622561 mujahideen mercenaries from the middle east and central asia were recruited to fight in the ranks of the kosovo liberation army kla in 1998 99 largely supporting natos war effort
5622562 the u s state department listed the kla as a terrorist organization indicating that it was financing its operations with money from the international heroin trade and loans from islamic countries and individuals among them allegedly usama bin laden
5622563 the brother of a leader in an egyptian jihad organization and also a military commander of usama bin laden was leading an elite kla unit during the kosovo conflict
5622564 is an exact replica of an extreme right wing israeli plan to balkanize iraq an essential part of the balkanization of the whole middle east curiously henry kissinger was selling the same idea even before the 2003 invasion of iraq
5622565 this is classic divide and rule the objective is the perpetuation of arab disunity
5622566 independent commission set up by congress with the approval of president george w bush
5622567 has grown increasingly interested in the idea of splitting the shiite sunni and kurdish regions of iraq as the only alternative to what baker calls cutting and running or staying the course
5622568 iraqs federal future is already enshrined within its constitution allowing regions to form if not actually prescribing how this should happen
5622569 the iraqi parliament dominated by shia and kurds passed a bill earlier this month october 2006 allowing federal regions to form by majority vote in the provinces seeking merger
5622570 the law which unsurprisingly failed to win sunni support will be reviewed over the next 18 months in a bid to bring its opponents round
5622571 a system based upon five regions would seem to have more chance of succeeding
5622572 in the article peters explains that the best plan for the middle east would be to
5622573 accepting that international statecraft has never developed effective tools short of war for readjusting faulty borders a mental effort to grasp the middle easts
5622574 iraq should have been divided into three smaller states immediately
5622575 saudi arabia would suffer as great a dismantling as pakistan
5622576 iran a state with madcap boundaries would lose a great deal of territory to unified azerbaijan free kurdistan the arab shia state and free baluchistan but would gain the provinces around herat in todays afghanistan
5622577 what afghanistan would lose to persia in the west it would gain in the east as pakistans northwest frontier tribes would be reunited with their afghan brethren
5622578 for now but given time and the inevitable attendant bloodshed new and natural borders will emerge babylon has fallen more than once
5622579 oh and one other dirty little secret from 5 000 years of history ethnic cleansing works
5622580 has been used in a training program at natos defense college for senior military officers this map as well as other similar maps has most probably been used at the national war academy as well as in military planning circles
5622581 the sweeping reconfiguration of borders he proposes would necessarily involve massive ethnic cleansing and accompanying bloodshed on perhaps a genocidal scale
5622582 the idea as in bosnia is to maintain a united iraq by decentralizing it giving each ethno religious group kurd sunni arab and shiite arab room to run its own affairs while leaving the central government in charge of common interests
5622583 the first is to establish three largely autonomous regions with a viable central government in baghdad the kurdish sunni and shiite regions would each be responsible for their own domestic laws administration and internal security the central government would control border defense foreign affairs and oil revenues
5622584 the second element would be to entice the sunnis into joining the federal system with an offer they couldnt refuse to begin with running their own region should be far preferable to the alternatives being dominated by kurds and shiites in a central government or being the main victims of a civil war
5622585 would look like this the central government would be based on the areas where there are genuine common interests among the different iraqi parties that is foreign affairs border defense currency and above all oil and gas production and revenues
5622586 as for the regions whether they be three or four or five whatever it may be its up to all this is up to the iraqis to decide would be responsible for legislation administration and internal security
5622587 something that the united states was going to force down their throats
5622588 when ambassador ryan crocker appeared before the senate foreign relations committee he testified in favor of federalism in his private conversations with senators he also supported the idea
5622589 break up of iraq into three separate states with their own governments and representatives to the united nations but continued economic cooperation in a larger entity modeled on the european union
5622590 that the united states shouldnt necessarily keep iraq from splitting up

5622598 history makes it clear however that the legend of fanatical muslims sweeping through the world and forcing islam at the point of the sword upon conquered races is one of the most fantastically absurd myth that historians have ever repeated
5622599 the sword indeed but where will you get your sword every new opinion at its starting is precisely in a minority of one in one mans head alone there it dwells as yet one man alone of the whole world believes it there is one man against all men that he takes a sword and try to propagate with that will do little for him you must get your sword on the whole a thing will propagate itself as it can

5622613 unfortunately all my appeals towards reconciliation and to address the complicated issues fell on deaf ears
5622614 certain vested interests began an atmosphere of confrontation and of vendetta they blamed me of hatching conspiracies from aiwan e sadr
5622615 had it been a conspiracy we would not have done it
5622616 i publicly announced support to the government and offered to share all my experience with them to help address complicated issues it was confronting

5622621 whosoever says that our policies for last nine years were faulty and unsatisfactory should not damage pakistan
5622622 forget about the past and focus on future the government should find solutions for the problems and take the country forward
5622623 overall the environment for equity markets remains very difficult as it has now become clearer that we are witnessing a more severe economic slowdown

5622654 we successfully lured the calf about a kilometre out to sea probably the first time thats been done using a yacht as a surrogate mother
5622655 later we saw whales a bit further offshore and there was a slender chance it may have linked up with them but this morning we have got reports that it has returned to the western shores of pittwater
5622656 while its moving quite freely at the moment its condition would be expected to deteriorate over the next three days
5622657 weve consistently said it was a slim chance that it might link up with its mother or other whales but the reality is that in the wild for various reasons mothers sometimes reject their young
5622658 looking at its behaviour the way it was nuzzling up to yachts would indicate it was primarily still suckling
5622659 it really was trying to suckle just below the waterline and against the keel with its head engaged against the boat

5622670 about 4 years ago my wife and i decided to buy as many presents as possible online to avoid the traffic and malls and find online discounts instead we ended up saving almost 20 off what we would have paid retail with local taxes by using coupons and free shipping offers ive been a big fan of finding the best deals online since
5622671 many of the online coupon and deal sites are difficult to use its tough to find expiration dates we wanted to make a site and list as many deals as possible every day organize them and make it easy to search
5622672 sometimes a store will have a 20 off coupon running at the same time as a 10 off coupon with free shipping even if there is a great deal on the home page of a site still search for the merchant or product name to be sure youre getting the best possible deal

5622706 if youre one of the many developers who were waiting for something a bit more mature
5622707 this might be a good time to take another look
5622708 the beta sdk that were releasing today is the first big step on the sdks road to compatibility with 1 0
5622709 since this is a beta release applications developed with it may not quite be compatible with devices running the final android 1 0 however the apis are now pretty stable and we dont expect any major changes
5622710 since were now moving quickly toward 1 0 it may also help to know which direction were headed to help out weve also prepared a this will be a living document and well keep it up to date as the android landscape evolves currently it covers the next few months roughly through the end of the year and a bit into next year well update it with additional detail as we are able to but even right now it can help give you a picture of how things will play out as the first phones draw near enough of that though youre probably wondering whats actually new in the sdk well you should read the api delta report for all the details but here are a few highlights first and most obviously the new home screen is included along with a ton of ui changes for 1 0 some new applications are included an alarm clock calculator camera music player picture viewer and messaging for sms mms conversations several new development tools were added such as a graphical preview for xml layouts for users of eclipse and a tool for constructing 9 patch images since weve got a new home screen application now we thought the now obsolete version from the m5 early look sdk might be helpful to developers so its source is included as a sample a number of new apis are fleshed out and improved and others are now close to their final forms for 1 0 tons of bugs were fixed of course if you had problems with the mediaplayer try it now there are a lot of changes the ones in the list above are just my personal favorites so you should check out the links above for the full story not all the changes are additions though im sorry to say that we had to remove a few things such as the gtalkservice for security reasons and the bluetooth api theres a bit more detail in the links above and well follow up on those in particular here in this blog to give you the scoop in fact weve got a little list of topics we want to talk about here so stay tuned

5622719 i have asked her whether she has applied for a permit under her own bylaw for that if she hasnt and she does it i will take out a private prosecution of her and i will take it all the way through the courts

5622731 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
5622732 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5622733 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
5622734 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
5622735 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza

5622739 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5622740 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5622741 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5622742 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5622743 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5622744 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso

5622748 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5622749 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5622750 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5622751 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5622752 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5622753 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5622754 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5622755 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5622756 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5622757 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5622758 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5622759 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5622760 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5622761 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5622762 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5622763 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5622764 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5622765 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5622766 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5622767 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5622768 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5622769 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5622770 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5622771 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5622772 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5622773 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5622774 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5622775 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
5622776 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
5622777 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
5622778 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
5622779 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
5622780 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso

5622782 y as pa no morir de hambre buscaban los animales de los men ndez por eso los mataba men ndez
5622783 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer

5622786 sangre del gaucho y del indio s lo sirve para abonar la tierra
5622787 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
5622788 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta

5622792 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n

5622807 ber die richtige und notwendige konsolidierung der staatsfinanzen d rfen die b rger nicht vergessen werden denn sie und die unternehmen sind es die den aufschwung erwirtschaften und die finanzielle last der konsolidierung tragen deswegen ist es richtig jetzt ber entlastungen zu diskutieren
5622808 f r die politik ist es f nf vor zw lf wir stehen vor einem sp rbaren weltweiten abschwung die politik kann nicht so tun als ginge das uns nichts an die unternehmen erwarten weitere reformschritte wenn aus der derzeitigen korrekturphase nicht doch noch eine trend umkehr werden soll dem b rger mehr netto in der tasche lassen ist f r eine berw ltigende mehrheit von 85 prozent der richtige weg um das wirtschaftswachstum zu stabilisieren

5622828 die halbjahresergebnisse waren zweifellos entt uschend die margen kamen durch stark gestiegene rohstoff und energiekosten die allein im zweiten quartal um 10 prozent gestiegen sind immens unter druck besonders stark war der anstieg im april und mai ab mitte juni gelang es uns jedoch die h heren kosten mit verkaufspreiserh hungen zu kompensieren weitere signifikante preiserh hungen setzten sich auch im juli durch
5622829 die wirtschaftlichen bedingungen werden auch im zweiten halbjahr sehr anspruchsvoll in einigen m rkten vor allem in europa sp ren wir einen konjunkturr ckgang w hrend wir in anderen regionen allen voran in asien wo wir gut positioniert sind weiterhin solides wachstum sehen basierend auf unseren gegenw rtigen markteinsch tzungen der entwicklung der rohstoffkosten und wechselkurse gehen wir davon aus dass der im ersten quartal kommunizierte ausblick erreichbar ist diese einsch tzung st tzt sich auf die verbesserung der margen aufgrund von verkaufspreiserh hungen die sich im zweiten halbjahr auswirken werden f r den fall dass sich das wirtschaftliche umfeld weiter jedoch verschlechtert k nnten die ergebnisse schw cher ausfallen als wir zum jetzigen zeitpunkt erwarten

5622843 we booked it up a cliff in 10 seconds and we just saw this massive rush of water rage down the creek side
5622844 i think it is because of the intense training i have experienced in the past the great pressure that government officials exert on the athletes as well as the coach that they demand a gold medal otherwise it is meaningless liu xiang has been put under a bit too much expectation

5622850 those afraid of the universe as it really is those who pretend to nonexistent knowledge and envision a cosmos centered on human beings will prefer the fleeting comforts of superstition they avoid rather than confront the world but those with the courage to explore the weave and structure of the cosmos even where it differs profoundly from their wishes and prejudices will penetrate its deepest mysteries

5622860 if you think someone went up there to build that it would take a greater miracle than the flood of noah itself

5622862 ive got new found optimism as far as my continuing push to have the intelligence community declassify some of the more definitive type imagery
5622863 i had no preconceived notions or agendas when i began this in 1993 as to what i was looking for
5622864 i maintain that if it is the remains of something manmade and potentially nautical then its potentially something of biblical proportions
5622865 it was the official decision of members of turkeys ministry of foreign affairs of internal affairs and researchers from ataturk university among others that the boat shaped formation did indeed contain the remains of noahs ark
5622866 evidence from microscopic studies and photo analyses demonstrates that the supposed ark near dogubayazit is a completely natural rock formation
5622867 it cannot have been noahs ark nor even a man made model it is understandable why early investigators falsely identified it
5622868 no one has ever looked for noahs ark on this mountain in armenia
5622869 there is a rectangle shaped boat on the top of this mountain this boat has what appears to be either a vent or windows you can see the whole outline of this ship and it is locked in the mountains you can see that it is big and man made
5622870 just when i think ive seen it all another group of nutters shows up

5622897 our committee is now in a position to put the final steps in place to complete the restructuring plan and note holders can look forward to the issuance of new notes and the establishment of a liquid market for them
5622898 absent any further appeals we expect the restructuring to close by sept 30 2008
5622899 it appears that even though this offer has been withdrawn there are other things happening at corel that could still involve an outright acquisition
5622900 it looks like the board and even vector given theyre such a huge holder with 69 per cent of outstanding shares have collectively identified what they believe to be a better alternative than vector taking the rest of the company private again
5622901 given the stocks so cheap its trading at five times 09 earnings and the growth rate is probably going to be 8 to 10 per cent there are probably other potential acquirers out there taking a look at corel
5622902 they see things a little bit weaker than they were expecting but not a heck of a lot
5622903 prices are still well above those in the u s
5622904 our prices are quite a bit lower this year than last year due to our increased purchasing power
5622905 i think people are much more cautious today than they were even three four months ago
5622906 i dont see doom and gloom but consumers are being careful
5622907 our main target is to boost the presence of our group in the united states
5622908 had this dragged on there could have been a negative impact on unionbancals business or some sort of reputational risk
5622909 i find that it is completely implausible to conclude that mr kaneshan could continue to drive a transport truck full time but that he was unable to occasionally drop his children off at school

5622917 most anybody when they leave their country their first choice would be to go back home if they could
5622918 if you look at these groups coming here theyre among the most unlikely to go back and those having the most trouble

5622950 theres always going to be a spore on a grassy knoll
5622951 we are a religiously pluralistic state there are many kinds of people who have to live together in california and i think the court framed this decision to make crystal clear that all patients must receive equal services regardless of the reason that an individual health care practitioner might have for wanting to turn people away
5622952 do the rights of religious freedom and free speech as guaranteed in both the federal and the california constitutions exempt a medical clinics physicians from complying with the california unruh civil rights acts prohibition against discrimination
5622953 californias compelling interest in ensuring full and equal access to medical treatment irrespective of sexual orientation
5622954 this decision may have a big impact on californias proposition 8 the initiative to protect traditional marriage as voters begin to recognize the radical agenda of our opposition
5622955 the ruling is an important one for california and beyond because it stands for the general principle that when you engage in discriminatory conduct in this case the refusal to treat someone in a medical setting based on their sexual orientation you cant claim that conduct has first amendment protection
5622956 you are a business and as a business non discrimination laws apply to you the same way they apply to any business

5623015 it is an issue of significant magnitude and it does need proper assessment and all governments working together to minimise the risks and ensure there is as little damage as possible
5623016 this really is very early work and many more factors need to be taken into account before we have concrete projections she said
5623017 it is going to be a negative story leading to damage of assets and loss of value
5623018 the evidence over the past 12 to 18 months suggests that we have underestimated how fast this aspect of the earths system can change he said

5623027 it is tough these days to get one gas cylinder due to their scarcity in the domestic markets and the increase of people demanding the same thing makes the situation a problem that affects all families
5623028 every year before ramadan there is a crisis like the one taking place these days i am sure that there is a terrible plan to worsen people s lives behind this crisis
5623029 diesel shortage in the governorate will be solved and diesel will be available in the coming 24 hours

5623032 over the long run fuel prices do have an effect a longer term process of adaption is set off the analysis said
5623033 it is possible that the recent oil price increases have set off such a process and that if oil prices remain on an upward trajectory the adaption process may still have a long way to run
5623034 a total of 71 people were on the coach including the driver
5623035 unfortunately one man suffered fatal injuries and was confirmed dead at the scene
5623036 the accident occurred in a very difficult area to access with the coach ending up on its side down a steep embankment which hampered rescue attempts
5623037 due to the scale and seriousness of the incident its fortunate there were not more serious or indeed fatal casualties
5623038 weve got two halfbacks with us and theres other players as well with us this time whove played in that position before the likes of matt giteau
5623039 i think in the first instance it probably wouldnt be a surprise to you that well look to experience
5623040 so im giving you an insight there that we dont normally do ive broken protocol there
5623041 experience is valuable but it comes down to how you use that
5623042 what previous experience in these sort of contests gives you is an insight but if you then dont use that to your best advantage then its not much value
5623043 they ran today and reported no ill effects on that so we just have to see how they go see how they respond to that work in particular tomorrow and just push on and take it as it comes
5623044 well consider our selection and that will pertain to the springboks
5623045 well look at what we believe will serve us best we havent made those decisions yet believe it or not so well have those discussions and well settle on a combination
5623046 the reality is you can only live in the moment and you can only deal with the challenges that youre presented with at any given point in time and weve got an opportunity coming this weekend and we are not thinking beyond that
5623047 foles has accepted a position with the waratahs which is great for him gives him some certainty
5623048 the russian side is gravely violating the conditions provided for by the peace accord signed by the presidents of georgia france and the russian federation
5623049 we will do whatever is necessary and no one should have any illusion
5623050 nobody is planning to withdraw the russian contingent very swiftly as there is no such necessity
5623051 i was shocked to see he is not supportive of this
5623052 i thought him being an advocate on health and everything i thought this would have been a natural thing for him to support
5623053 this is something that is going to take away from the real work that needs to be done
5623054 he requested me as a friend on facebook that was the highlight of my day
5623055 they say im having to work so hard to breathe im just going to give up and sit around in a wheelchair
5623056 he can have the quality of life of a normal person
5623057 i wanted to create a policy that would tell everyone how we are going to go about evaluating fire stations
5623058 san jose doesnt have a good policy to determine how to close fire stations
5623059 our group is not opposed to fire station 37 per se what we are opposed to is linking 6 and 37
5623060 i couldnt go to sleep because i was really excited
5623061 but its kind of sad because my brother and all my cousins are still sleeping

5623064 zimbabwes annual rate of inflation surged in june to 11 2 million percent
5623065 it gained 9 035 045 5 percentage points from the may rate of 2 233 713 4 percent
5623066 zimbabweans must realise that the country is in a practically binding state of socio economic emergency
5623067 as such there is need for a universal moratorium on all incomes and prices for a minimum period of six months
5623068 women are delaying their childbearing until they complete their educations
5623069 this is the first time weve looked at a lot of these characteristics
5623070 that to me is counter intuitive because a large share of our poor population is latino and they tend to have higher birth rates
5623071 tend to be two parent families and overwhelmingly working and because if youre undocumented youre not eligible for cash assistance programs
5623072 i can put the great tradition in one word privilege
5623073 alguien del staff le pregunt a zac que para qui n eran los peluqueros y el respondi que eran para vanessa hudgens pero en realidad eran para l
5623074 if the milf as a whole has really no hand in these treacherous attacks then i challenge them to surrender their ground leaders specifically bravo and umbra kato as a sign of good faith
5623075 if it is true that the milf leadership did not issue the order to attack the milf elements who pillaged some villages in lanao del norte should be pursued by the milf in coordination with government security forces they should not allow their rogue members from destroying our gains in the peace process
5623076 if the milf cannot surrender their rogue members they can choose to disown them if these ground leaders do not adhere to their organizations tenets and they prove to be obstacles to the peace path then why dont the leaders expel them from the organization
5623077 they should not protect these elements from being pursued by the government forces if indeed they have acted on their own in attacking several parts of mindanao
5623078 im beginning to doubt if we are conducting peace talks with the right people this defiance to the directives of their hierarchy is a sign that those who are behind the attacks have gone rogue and are no longer part of the milfs chain of command it shows sign of weak leadership if the milf leaders cannot act to discipline their own members
5623079 they should take a grip first of their entire organization unless and until unity and cooperation inside the milf structure is ensured peace talk should be suspended how can the government forge unity and agreement with an organization that cannot forge the same in its own backyard
5623080 you all know we have bent as far backward as possible to give peace a chance
5623081 if they keep on saying that line and they continue to fail controlling them milf sub commanders then the government will certainly control them

5623091 we have heard about suicide bombers on foot they are receiving indirect fire

5623109 its huge its the opportunity that no startup generally gets
5623110 with opportunity obviously theres a lot of responsibility for us to take advantage of it properly and do it in a way that not only benefits the company but also benefits michael
5623111 we are currently evaluating opportunities to build upon this excitement however a final determination about our future plans has not yet been made
5623112 is he funny is he warm is he interesting does he say things that make you want to listen more or is he the great athlete who is pleased to be here and hes done its going to be interesting
5623113 i have one simple question when was the first time that mccain told this story
5623114 der einsatz von st cken macht aus walking ein training bei dem zus tzlich die muskulatur des oberk rpers beansprucht wird nordic walking ist f r ambitionierte sportler ebenso geeignet wie f r untrainierte menschen
5623115 ich hatte die stelle erst zwei tage als die maschine eine st rung hatte sie zerfetzte meinen finger unabl ssig floss blut niemand aus meiner familie war bei mir deshalb befolgte ich einfach was die gesch ftsleitung mir geraten hatte und lie den finger amputieren ich dachte jetzt ist alles gelaufen was konnte ich mit der verst mmelten hand noch anfangen meine eltern und die nachbarn zu hause hatten mich vorher sehr gemocht bei der suche nach einem mann hatte ich die wahl gehabt das war jetzt anders es war gar nicht daran zu denken dass ich mir jetzt noch jemanden h tte aussuchen k nnen
5623116 the single largest contributing factor to the pollution of streams creaks rivers and near shore coastal waters is stormwater runoff
5623117 the city has exercised great leadership by putting this on the ballot and its the right course of action
5623118 all we need is some very specific projects that catch the water before it reaches the ocean filters it cleans it and then puts it into the ocean
5623119 it doesnt take that much to do these specific projects
5623120 they are very transparent and i think its very clear how we spend our money
5623121 its well spent and we will continue to do that
5623122 once we get this plan set up and working well have other neighborhoods looking at this model
5623123 he was quiet calm collected a real thinker and not a risk taker
5623124 today were doing a more intense search than sunday turning over every inch
5623125 he has the skills and ability to take care of himself out there
5623126 hes heavily involved in the community both he and his wife
5623127 as far as edwin getting lost in the area its hard to believe
5623128 he knew his land so well knew every tree on his property unless something overtook him physically or mentally he wouldnt be lost
5623129 if it cuts off circulation in a leg or wing you have dead tissue
5623130 wed go out in the skiffs and take the hooks out
5623131 if anything its been on the positive side of the ledger pelicans are part of our ecosystem just like us we should be able to maintain a healthy balance
5623132 we dont feel like this is a loss at all
5623133 its not surprising kelsay released him its good news that he was released with conditions
5623134 i dont know if he had a change of heart the conditions are a little bit different than last time
5623135 normally i dont come across a property with 50 dogs on it like this
5623136 were concerned about our victim and what shes been through
5623137 we know thats important this guy may not have given her his real name if he intended to rape her when he met her
5623138 wed like to talk to anyone who was in the area who may have seen something
5623139 some of that is information that only the suspect would know
5623140 he may have decided he was going to leave the country he may have been here for the weekend and then gone back
5623141 this is a serious felony you cant run to another country and expect to hide from something like this
5623142 you can sit here and tell your friends that this didnt happen but you know it did
5623143 but i forgive you and i do pray you will ask for forgiveness god has something more for you
5623144 as a friend a fellow police officer a fellow brother in christ
5623145 i placed my trust and my heart in his hands
5623146 he took one of the most important people in my life save for god and spit on them
5623147 i do apologize for all the pain ive caused the victims family
5623148 i dont care about the 9 000 car trips that doesnt mean anything to me
5623149 i want to know how long my kid is going to be unsupervised in the parking lot
5623150 i just think its a poor place to put it
5623151 the traffic the noise will be bad i live fairly close to here i just can imagine the back up horns at 3 a m
5623152 still cause traffic mess anywhere in the area its not going to be too pleasant
5623153 i can tell you if the traffic and economics prove to be a hardship for the city were going to vote no its that simple
5623154 i feel very disenfranchised i cant vote for the city council
5623155 how are you going to consider us because we have no political hold over you
5623156 todos tenemos la misma sangre egipcia y si el motivo de la medida es prohibir el tr fico de rganos lo rechazamos porque puede ocurrir tambi n entre fieles de la misma religi n
5623157 tenemos miedo a que en el futuro haya hospitales para cristianos y otros para musulmanes
5623158 todo es para proteger a los musulmanes pobres de los cristianos ricos que les compran sus rganos y al rev s
5623159 impedir cualquier intento de enga ar a los enfermos y robarles sus rganos sobre todo si ocurre entre cristianos y musulmanes porque en este caso s abre la puerta a una crisis entre ambas comunidades
5623160 instigar a la discriminaci n entre un musulm n y un cristiano que viven en el mismo pa s
5623161 discriminatoria ya que viola los derechos humanos la constituci n y la unidad nacional
5623162 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5623163 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5623164 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5623165 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5623166 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5623167 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5623168 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5623169 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5623170 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5623171 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5623172 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5623173 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5623174 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5623175 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5623176 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5623177 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5623178 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5623179 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5623180 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

5623182 but i love it at worcester and i just want to get on and play now
5623183 i have an ambition to play for england and the club say theyll support me in those sorts of goals
5623184 the support i have received from my fianc e family team mates supporters and the club has been overwhelming
5623185 i am really pleased to continue my career with worcestershire and i am looking forward to taking the field with the current squad of talented worcestershire players and competing for trophies and championships in the future
5623186 stephen has really shown his true worth to the team this season
5623187 he is undoubtedly one the leading batsmen in the country
5623188 he and daryl mitchell are fast becoming one of the most reliable opening partnerships in the county championship and i am pleased we will see this partnership develop over the next few years
5623189 i know that stephen has aspirations to play for england and it is well known how committed we are to developing players for england its testament to the club that he has chosen to pursue those aspirations with us when so many counties were after his signature

5623192 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5623193 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5623194 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
5623195 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5623196 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5623197 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5623198 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5623199 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5623200 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5623201 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5623202 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5623203 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5623204 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5623205 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5623206 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5623207 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5623208 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5623209 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5623210 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5623211 i screamed my head off when you guys won last week
5623212 ahli were disappointed at what happened with the transfer of meteb to bristol city as they felt the involvement of a number of agents clouded the matter
5623213 they are willing to sell meteb for the right price and they have given me the mandate to do any deal
5623214 i have had a long standing relationship with ahli and they do not want any other parties getting involved in any transfer
5623215 i have worked with ahli before in the past and i brought the first egyptian to the premier league when i took ibrahim said to everton in 2003
5623216 news of metebs availability has alerted a number of clubs in england with teams in the premier league and championship interested in his services
5623217 meteb is determined to try his luck in england and a work permit would not be an issue as he was granted one at bristol city before the move fell through
5623218 as far as performance of the team is concerned we have won the trophy what more can i say winning the most valuable player award was a bonus
5623219 he is complaining of a hamstring and calf problem he shall train from tomorrow
5623220 if players do what i expect and say i am sure we will not just be a part of south africa 2010 but we will also do something significant
5623221 i want this to be another big step in my career for me success with the black stars will mean success in angola and success in qualifying for south africa 2010 and doing well there
5623222 if we work together as a team with positive energy then we will be there in 2010
5623223 i will lead from the front of course but a lot will depend on how we all work together
5623224 i am very happy and proud to be to be in a country where football is so popular the talent in this country and the passion for football is one of the reasons i could not turn this down
5623225 since i came here ive played as a winger but i will do what the manager wants me to do
5623226 i played most of my career as a winger but i have played as a striker before
5623227 i want to play and i want to be part of the team so it doesnt matter where i play the manager said i have something he likes as a striker so i have to keep showing him why i should be picked i will keep trying and when i get the chances i will try to score some goals
5623228 i was very pleased with my goal but it would have been better if we had won the game we should have got three points from that game it was very disappointing but we have to look forward
5623229 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5623230 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5623231 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5623232 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5623233 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5623234 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5623235 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5623236 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5623237 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5623238 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5623239 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5623240 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5623241 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5623242 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5623243 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

5623245 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5623246 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5623247 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5623248 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5623249 the last thing i needed in the last week before erotica was to spend all of this time on this but ive always stood up for what i believe in ive never backed away from a fight and im not going to stop at the last hurdle
5623250 im sick of fighting this every year when i believe it is a right lets do it once and for all go to court and ill get a decision which i believe is consistent with the bill of rights
5623251 i have asked her whether she has applied for a permit under her own bylaw for that if she hasnt and she does it i will take out a private prosecution of her and i will take it all the way through the courts
5623252 the bill of rights has trampled all over the rights of families its basically said the pornography industry has more rights than the protection and well being of families and our children
5623253 this is a free for all now any grubby parade can happen on the street and its the bill of rights i have a right
5623254 as soon as somebody has a right other peoples rights are being infringed upon

5623257 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5623258 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5623259 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5623260 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5623261 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5623262 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

5623302 the local consultants who are leading this project are looking forward to treating people in a state of the art facility designed specifically to promote healing and wellness
5623303 we work in collaboration with the national health service and existing hospital providers with the aim to complement their work to serve the provision of a more personal and accessible kind of healthcare in line with government policy
5623304 this is a very exciting project and we are delighted that the wheels are in motion now we have submitted the planning application

5623308 we put some urchins in a tank and got them feeding on algae then we recorded them the noise they were producing caused spikes at certain frequencies
5623309 the noise they make is the sound of those teeth scraping on the rocks a large urchin will have a low resonance frequency while a small urchin will have a higher frequency
5623310 when they emerge from their crevices at dusk theyre probably really hungry munching away quite rapidly

5623320 we are looking at a company in the cardio sector
5623321 the legal cases between oklahoma and arkansas evolved from a conflict over point source pollution involving municipal wastewater discharge to a conflict over nonpoint source pollution in the form of nutrient runoff from poultry litter
5623322 in light of three decades or more of significant structural changes in the animal agricultural production system this shift from point source to nonpoint source mirrors the evolution of how water quality has been addressed since the enactment of clean water act
5623323 discernable confined and discrete conveyances including any pipe ditch channel tunnel conduit well from which pollutants may be discharged
5623324 a consequence of these structural changes is that extraordinary amounts of animal waste are produced in geographically limited areas
5623325 this waste must be disposed of or utilized somehow and a traditional and common method is for producers to apply it to the land as fertilizer
5623326 policymakers may begin to consider new policy approaches to addressing nonpoint source pollution particularly if they conclude that addressing the issue through region based litigation may not be the most effective tool to address a national issue the thought might be that perhaps theres a better way to address these problems without litigation or overly burdensome government regulation
5623327 you will beat us if we were to get to 14 or 15 golds at these games we would view that as a fantastic result
5623328 our chef de mission john coates believes you can see the results at these games of the extra funding which the british team has benefited from across a wider range of sports we are working on a proposal for our government to provide more sports funding for london 2012
5623329 he told me we had the money we have sold players for more than 20 million during the summer and he told me if you sell players you can buy with that too
5623330 i have the support of at least one of the owners i sent e mails to all of them but he was clear we had the money if the manager has an idea and it is not a question of money we have to make the right decision in terms of who we bring in that has to be the decision of the manager
5623331 we have problems because we are not doing things that in my opinion we have to do in terms of signing players
5623332 the question is that we have to be quicker and i told them these things four years ago and i continue thinking the same

5623347 since 1967 developers have been mandated to put sidewalks in with improved streets that have curbs and gutters in wooster
5623348 because of no reason other than maybe oversight some properties do not have sidewalks there are a lot of children who live in apartments along normandy there is one single family residence and the rest are multi family and oftentimes its been observed that children will run out onto the street between cars
5623349 itll cost me money to build it and cost me money to maintain it unless somebody needs a sidewalk or if somebody living on a street asks for it i dont see why it should be done
5623350 this will give them time to secure contractors and do the necessary work
5623351 to delay it another two weeks i dont see much of a difference you either vote for or against it
5623352 in this particular case it would appear that the girl was a willing participant in the sex act
5623353 the law is however written to protect those who are by the nature of their young age unable to make informed decisions
5623354 apparently he felt that trading merchandise in this case beer for sex rather than cash would somehow justify his actions
5623355 while the fact that a 43 year old man engaging in sex with a 14 year old girl is troubling it becomes more so when the man feels that admitting to providing the girl with alcohol will somehow lessen the severity of his crime
5623356 squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5623357 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5623358 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5623359 thats not important to me its the team thats important
5623360 shes the kind of kid that you say is a woman playing with girls
5623361 thats not to undermine any of the other girls shes just ridiculously that good
5623362 she is so athletic with exceptionally long arms and is so strong
5623363 we never make a call we just go we read each other so well and that saves a lot of time
5623364 i dont really know how hard she hits until im on the other side of the net
5623365 i feel like i can just read the court better now
5623366 she now knows that she doesnt have to be perfect
5623367 we hope to build on the progress we made last season we graduated two very talented seniors in heidi wiebe and katie kacere but all of the returnees have improved so we expect to be stronger overall this season
5623368 this will be our second season together we have established our program goals and have a lot of new faces on the floor this year
5623369 we are striving to become one of those strong programs and develop a high level of play our goal is defend our title as league champions and win our schools first ever back to back volleyball championships
5623370 this group has a leadership quality and cohesiveness with each other they have worked to improve strength and will be looking to be stronger at the net and have a quicker defense mentally we have improved and will play a more consistent game because of it
5623371 we have some big shoes to fill from last years seniors we wont overpower teams offensively but we hope to be the better defensive team every time we step on the court
5623372 im so excited to begin my head coaching career here at kingsway the girls are some of the best i have worked with we are very young this season but the girls are all eager to learn
5623373 our style of play team chemistry and leadership have all undergone a major transition we have only three returning letterwinners and no seniors but the fundamental basis of competitive team volleyball at lhs remains
5623374 we are a very experienced team returning all but one letterwinner we are very excited about the upcoming season the girls had a fantastic offseason and summer and are ready to get back into the gym
5623375 we return many in the strength area serving hitting blocking setting and digging
5623376 we are looking for big things this season we will have to raise the bar from last years 17 wins a district final appearance there are many fine teams out there and we must figure out a way to defeat them
5623377 our lineup wont look very new with so many players returning but we have loads of experience now and have become much stronger physically our intent is to speed up our offensive attack
5623378 i have great senior leadership that is determined to have an amazing season im proud of our volleyball program with the all of the hard work they have given we are ready to start the season
5623379 with six seniors on our team we have tremendous leadership their experience and work ethic set the tone everyday whether at practice or during a match this team has terrific rapport with one another and team chemistry is great as with all high school teams serve receive always needs work the titans are looking for sole ownership of the pac championship this season two co championships and a runner up finish in 2005 have left this group hungry they are not interested in sharing this season
5623380 last year we were young and inexperienced this season we have everyone back with the one exception my hope will be that with a high number of seniors with experience we will be competitive
5623381 i think we have a strong team bond and work well together our lack of size in our hitters will cause us to have a hard time putting the ball away our goal is to finish at the top of the league just like everyone else wants to
5623382 the lack of experience and health as we have had 4 5 probable starters out all year so far have been a weakness well be very young and inexperienced but much bigger and more athletic than last year
5623383 losing five seniors whom all played leaves a lot of opportunities for the incoming group the girls have been working hard to get better everyday

5623389 keep in mind that i dont think theres one magic bullet for energy theres a combination of things we can do with increased production being one of the big things
5623390 i think ethanol works great as a blend in gas as an additive and as an extender
5623391 were an energy intensive industry maybe for farmers in holmes county thats not the case we drive diesel tractors pickup trucks we have propane dryers to dry our crops
5623392 were not going to go back to two mules and 40 acres if we did wed turn around american agriculture in the country to where it wouldnt be anywhere as effective as it is now
5623393 if you noticed we had gas over 4 a gallon and the price went down the day president bush signed an executive order repealing a previous executive order protecting anwr from drilling
5623394 we should have been doing that a long time ago
5623395 the way they do things now theyre more environmentally friendly now than they have ever been
5623396 i think congress owes us more than just saying inflate our tires ride our bicycles and wait for the wind to blow they owe us a better explanation than that

5623398 our voters are intrigued by our new top two system of voting which once again allows them to pick their favorite candidate for each office without regard to party
5623399 this system is remarkably simple the top two voter favorites move on to the general election
5623400 every last vote to create momentum from the primary to prove theyre competitive
5623401 our campaign thus far has been outspent 2 1 on tv
5623402 over 2 5 million has been spent on tv advertising either by or on behalf of christine gregoire compared to only 1 2 million spent by for rossi
5623403 the old rule of thumb is that perhaps 60 percent of the vote is counted by election night
5623404 but as more of us vote by mail probably over 90 percent this year the participation rate takes time to tally because the ballot only has to be postmarked from anywhere on the planet by election day

5623407 we are delighted the oft has recognised the sos as a scheme which can make a real difference to way estate agents handle complaints
5623408 we offer a robust process we know how to talk to consumers whose complaints have not been resolved we have systems which are tailored to our needs and an approach to dispute resolution which has been proven to work across different industry sectors
5623409 we will use our experience to provide the best possible service to estate agents which choose to join our service and their customers
5623410 the oft has been careful to ensure that customers of estate agents will have access to effective independent redress if an estate agent fails to resolve a problem appropriately
5623411 with the approval process complete i am pleased we can now work toward providing the same first class service of dispute resolution as we provide to existing members to new members and the consumers who use their estate agency services
5623412 i said that this was an inquiry that was not needed from the beginning
5623413 it is the second biggest economy in the world and in 50 years it will be the biggest economy in the world
5623414 starting with diefenbaker trudeau and all of us we established very good relations relatively speaking with china and suddenly you break the bridge
5623415 i find it ironic that prime minister chr tien somehow skipped the 94 98 2000 and 2002 opening ceremonies based on his remarks should we conclude that relations with those countries were damaged because prime minister chr tien did not attend four out of five olympic games that took place while he was prime minister

5623428 access to the president doesnt mean youre going to get the truth
5623429 he never really aspired to be president but lightning struck
5623430 he turned out to be a good president because he really restored confidence in the oval office and a sense of security in the country after watergate
5623431 missed his calling he would have been a great minister
5623432 they reagan advisers james baker ed meese and michael deaver taught him to say this is not a press conference they had him quite trained on that
5623433 at the tail end both he and mrs bush began to think we were the cause of all their troubles so the press was not liked at all
5623434 clinton was denied his legitimacy as president by the ultra right in this country
5623435 he was asked so many personal questions no president has ever been subjected to that kind of tyranny
5623436 theres a blackout now i believe until the end of his term
5623437 helen represents what is necessary to make our democracy function at its highest level journalists asking tough questions of presidents
5623438 its still the only way the public can get the information to make educated choices
5623439 i havent got a clue to be honest with you i havent played many games recently so i honestly cant say
5623440 there is a big squad there and everyone is fighting for their place and i just have to train well and take the chance if i get it
5623441 you would have to ask the club i have been trying to get into the team
5623442 i havent played but i will just wait and see and when the transfer window closes we will know then
5623443 i will wait and see if i can get into the team if not then obviously i want to play so we will just have to take it from there
5623444 we have spoken about it but at this time i dont think i will say too much more
5623445 theres no doubt i would like to go to a major tournament i havent been for a few years and that appeals to anyone
5623446 the disappointments of the last few tournaments thats in the back of your head and you would love to go to another world cup
5623447 i was fortunate enough to go in 2002 so that enticed me to come back
5623448 when i met the manager at the end of last season it changed my mind
5623449 i had the summer to think about it because it wasnt an easy decision it wasnt easy to quit
5623450 but when i met the manager i liked what i heard so i made that decision
5623451 he has got a lot of experience and just the way he was talking about certain things i suppose he persuaded me to come back
5623452 you have got to respect someone who has done well in management
5623453 pretty caucasian young woman wet in shower in transparent shirt leaning against glass
5623454 im so happy its unbelievable i wanted to reach the final and now that i have won the gold its really great for my family and great for kenya
5623455 we planned to run as a team and bring the medals with janeth and im happy things went the right way i dedicate my medal to my mother and to all kenyans and i urge parents to encourage their children to take up sports along with education i would not be here if my mother did not encourage me to run
5623456 i told her that since she was the stronger one between us she should just attack the race and go all the way
5623457 im happy the race went that way and im also happy that brimin kipruto won the steeplechase gold medal its a great night for kenya
5623458 i feel great i knew it was my race and i knew if i was in the leading group with 200 metres to go i would beat anybody
5623459 i was inspired to take up athletics by watching the performances of people like former world record holder moses kiptanui winning i wanted it to be a clean kenyan 1 2 3 sweep but unfortunately the frenchman came between us it is strange because i have never seen this man or competed against him before
5623460 i was thrilled along with all kenyans to learn of pamela jelimo and brimin kiprutos feats in winning gold medals for our country at the 2008 olympic games in beijing
5623461 i wish to also congratulate the other champions who won silver and bronze medals yesterday surely more medals are on the way
5623462 so i salute our dear athletes in beijing who have done us proud with their victories i also salute our other athletes who have given their best for the country and won us praise on the world stage as true sportsmen and sportswomen
5623463 they have done us proud in china and we expect more gold medals before the olympics are over although the economy is hard these athletes should be given something by every kenyan of goodwill
5623464 kenya has stamped its authority as a powerhouse in the athletics by that incredible performance the way jelimo ran reminds you of the gazelle in our wildlife reserves
5623465 if the remaining athletes remain focused we shall get at least four golds
5623466 the pace set by jelimo and brimin kipruto is a challenge to the remaining athletes
5623467 if my age could have allowed i could have joined athletics since it is one straight way to riches

5623497 there are vulnerabilities all around the australian coastline she said
5623498 it is an issue of significant magnitude and it does need proper assessment and all governments working together to minimise the risks and ensure there is as little damage as possible
5623499 this really is very early work and many more factors need to be taken into account before we have concrete projections she said
5623500 it is going to be a negative story leading to damage of assets and loss of value

5623507 if you look at the sales statistics you see that people are pursuing straighter hair with more vigour
5623508 most people on tv and in films have straight hair and its a trend the public is trying to emulate

5623584 its not a lesser english its one type of world english
5623585 we cannot write like the english we should not we cannot write only as indians our method of expression therefore has to be a dialect which will some day prove to be as distinctive and colourful as the irish or american
5623586 thats a direct consequence of international scope the fact that english has travelled so far around the world and mixed with so many other cultures and has absorbed influences from all those other cultures it has been an amazingly tolerant language
5623587 some people feel threatened because the standard isnt adhered to across the board
5623588 in a sense it is a true reflection of the 21st century where immigration of groups permanent crossing of national boundaries is one of the constants of our lifestyle the english language has a head start over lots of other languages because it already is so cosmopolitan in its constituents

5623601 justice paulseth appears to have dealt with the matter of this childs custody in a cavalier and overly casual manner
5623602 the only defence that child had was the law which is designed to defend her and the court who has an obligation to uphold that law
5623603 thats why i think its imperative that the ontario judicial council review her conduct to determine whether or not it constitutes misconduct how many other similar cases did this judge preside over
5623604 the attorney general chris bentley and children and youth services minister deb matthews are looking at this to find out what lessons we might draw from this and to determine whether or not we should be doing something different

5623658 what is surprising is that 77 applications were even filed in light of the high risks protesters run of arrest harassment and physical harm
5623659 these 77 protest applicants should shame those who say that chinese are content with some different and lower standard of liberty and it should impel apologists for the governments appalling performance to insist that real human rights benchmarks be part of any future olympic hosting

5623671 this has been a very exciting and eventful quarter for us with the approval of the first test based on our microrna technology and the acquisition of a clia certified lab both of which represent key milestones on our path to become a fully commercial company
5623672 the approval of the first test acts as strong validation to micrornas ability to be utilized as powerful biomarkers and we expect two additional tests for differentiating mesothelioma from adenocarcinomas in the lung and identifying the primary origin of a metastasis to be submitted for regulatory approval in the coming months in addition we expect to begin development of tests at our newly acquired clia lab furthermore the rapid progress in our development programs has allowed us to advance three additional cancer tests up our pipeline these tests are focused on predicting response to ovarian cancer treatment predicting risk of gastric cancer recurrence and differentiating small cell from non small cell lung cancer finally we are moving three additional diagnostics up the pipeline the first is being developed to detect the presence of colon cancer in serum the second is being developed to detect the presence of bladder cancer and the third is being developed to predict colon cancer risk of recurrence after surgery rosetta genomics will continue its rapid pace towards commercialization of microrna based tests

5623674 we still have a belief in eadys guilt which made for an agonizing decision
5623675 i expect that there will be shades of the truth told in a trial
5623676 but we rely on certain foundational things that someone is not going to tell a straight out lie this is very frustrating and disturbing

5623678 there are bad storms and there are nice ones and this is a nice one
5623679 it cleans out all the trees it gives people a little work to do and it gets the tourists out of here for a few days
5623680 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5623681 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous

5623693 hes shown all the right qualities at this stage but these things come with more experience and game time hell end up being a really good player for us
5623694 its a very good reward for cale there are three mortons playing in the afl and were pleased with him and we think weve got the best one obviously i shouldnt say that

5623704 justice paulseth appears to have dealt with the matter of this childs custody in a cavalier and overly casual manner
5623705 the only defence that child had was the law which is designed to defend her and the court who has an obligation to uphold that law
5623706 thats why i think its imperative that the ontario judicial council review her conduct to determine whether or not it constitutes misconduct how many other similar cases did this judge preside over
5623707 the attorney general chris bentley and children and youth services minister deb matthews are looking at this to find out what lessons we might draw from this and to determine whether or not we should be doing something different
5623708 good questions and the public is entitled to good answers and its our responsibility to get those it may very well be that we have to make a change
5623709 thats all being looked at now we want to see how frequently this occurs what steps might be taken do all judges approach this in the same way obviously what has to prevail here is the safety of the child

5623721 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5623722 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5623723 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5623724 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5623725 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5623726 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5623727 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5623728 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5623729 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5623730 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5623731 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5623732 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5623733 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
5623734 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
5623735 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
5623736 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
5623737 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
5623738 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
5623739 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
5623740 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
5623741 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
5623742 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
5623743 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
5623744 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5623745 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5623746 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5623747 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5623748 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5623749 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5623750 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5623751 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5623752 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5623753 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5623754 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5623755 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5623756 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5623757 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5623758 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5623759 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5623760 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5623761 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5623762 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5623763 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5623764 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5623765 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5623766 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

5623776 ill be here im not going away until shes off the bench
5623777 we want to see how frequent this occurs what steps might be taken do all judges approach this in the same way those kinds of things
5623778 cancer may reflect a partial and aberrant loss of differentiated character in which cells that were formerly specified to perform a specific task forget that and become more like the rapidly dividing stem cells from which they came
5623779 understanding how differentiated states are specified might help us figure out how to remind cancer cells to go back to their original tasks or fates or more likely die
5623780 daughter cell gene expression is special and now we know why

5623782 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5623783 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5623784 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5623785 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5623786 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5623787 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5623788 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5623789 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5623790 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5623791 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5623792 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5623793 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5623794 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5623795 this is a planning took where all things are going
5623796 yeah thats right what are you gonna do about it
5623797 we have to help the people suffering in that country
5623798 this letter is a disgusting attempt to justify the deliberate killings
5623799 canada is trying to bring security and stability to the afghan people and this will not deter us from doing that
5623800 we will continue to fight for these goals and work to protect the afghan people
5623801 the conditions and events which affect the mission are constantly being evaluated
5623802 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5623803 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5623804 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5623805 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5623806 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5623807 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5623808 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5623809 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5623810 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5623811 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5623812 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5623813 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5623814 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5623815 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5623816 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5623817 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5623818 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5623819 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5623820 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5623821 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5623822 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5623823 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5623824 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5623825 the vast majority of the discussion participants 86 percent shared knowledge to solve problems and more than half 58 percent used systematic and evaluative processes researchers found

5623830 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5623831 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5623832 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5623833 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5623834 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5623835 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5623836 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5623837 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5623838 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5623839 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5623840 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally

5623885 peter has made a wonderful contribution in both the financial and strategic directions of qantas over the past eight years and has served the company and shareholders with distinction
5623886 hogans legal arguments are unsupported by case authority and without merit
5623887 here as the party challenging the summonses hogan has the heavy burden of rebutting the governments good faith showing
5623888 he has failed to carry that burden with naked arguments and bald assertions without evidence in support of such allegations are insufficient to rebut a prima facie case for summons enforcement
5623889 first hogan is wrong because the summonses do not seek tax returns
5623890 second hogan is wrong because resident status is not the test for whether an investigation is unnecessary
5623891 over the long run fuel prices do have an effect a longer term process of adaption is set off the analysis said
5623892 it is possible that the recent oil price increases have set off such a process and that if oil prices remain on an upward trajectory the adaption process may still have a long way to run
5623893 we are absolutely delighted that neale has accepted this position with the west coast eagles

5623922 if youre one of the many developers who were waiting for something a bit more mature
5623923 this might be a good time to take another look
5623924 the beta sdk that were releasing today is the first big step on the sdks road to compatibility with 1 0
5623925 since this is a beta release applications developed with it may not quite be compatible with devices running the final android 1 0 however the apis are now pretty stable and we dont expect any major changes
5623926 since were now moving quickly toward 1 0 it may also help to know which direction were headed to help out weve also prepared a this will be a living document and well keep it up to date as the android landscape evolves currently it covers the next few months roughly through the end of the year and a bit into next year well update it with additional detail as we are able to but even right now it can help give you a picture of how things will play out as the first phones draw near enough of that though youre probably wondering whats actually new in the sdk well you should read the api delta report for all the details but here are a few highlights first and most obviously the new home screen is included along with a ton of ui changes for 1 0 some new applications are included an alarm clock calculator camera music player picture viewer and messaging for sms mms conversations several new development tools were added such as a graphical preview for xml layouts for users of eclipse and a tool for constructing 9 patch images since weve got a new home screen application now we thought the now obsolete version from the m5 early look sdk might be helpful to developers so its source is included as a sample a number of new apis are fleshed out and improved and others are now close to their final forms for 1 0 tons of bugs were fixed of course if you had problems with the mediaplayer try it now there are a lot of changes the ones in the list above are just my personal favorites so you should check out the links above for the full story not all the changes are additions though im sorry to say that we had to remove a few things such as the gtalkservice for security reasons and the bluetooth api theres a bit more detail in the links above and well follow up on those in particular here in this blog to give you the scoop in fact weve got a little list of topics we want to talk about here so stay tuned

5623929 well if the movie isnt that great ive still got the comic
5623930 can use overwhelming regional military power to beat up on a small neighbor
5623931 russia is a state that is unfortunately using the one tool it has always used when it wishes to deliver a message and thats its military power
5623932 thats not the way to deal in the 21st century
5623933 a very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
5623934 nobody needs russian strategic aviation along americas coasts so this effort to somehow assert russian power or influence by military means is something that weve been seeing for a while
5623935 it cant act in the way it did when it was the cold war and it was the soviet union and expect to be treated as a responsible partner
5623936 the kind of language russia uses about poland isnt tolerable
5623937 when people reach out a hand of friendship its really not responsible language to threaten them with nuclear attack as apparently some unnamed russian general apparently did
5623938 mounting evidence that russian and georgian military used armed force unlawfully during the south ossetian conflict
5623939 ongoing militia attacks and a growing humanitarian crisis also indicate the urgent need for the deployment of a mission to enhance civilian protection
5623940 deploy a robust european defense agency mission consisting of police and security forces to ensure protection of civilians and the return of displaced persons to their homes
5623941 it had been taking an entirely routine flight and was on a perfectly normal approach to land at coventry

5623946 in the second decade of the twentieth century it was almost impossible to build an airplane in the united states
5623947 the commons leads to overuse and destruction the anticommons leads to underuse and waste in the cultural sphere ever tighter restrictions on copyright and fair use limit artists abilities to sample and build on older works of art
5623948 in theory one should be able to break a gridlock by striking a deal that would leave all sides better off sometimes that happens just the other week for instance nokia and qualcomm settled a three year long patent battle which could accelerate the spread of third generation cell phone technology here and in europe in a less contentious fashion products like the dvd player quickly became mainstream and affordable because many companies worked together to form patent pools
5623949 recent experimental work by the psychologist sven vanneste and the legal scholar ben depoorter helps explain why when something you own is necessary to the success of a venture even if its contribution is small youll tend to ask for an amount close to the full value of the venture and since everyone in your position also thinks he deserves a huge sum the venture quickly becomes unviable so the next time we start handing out new ownership rights whether via patents or copyright or privatization better try to weigh all the good things that wont happen as a result otherwise we wont know what weve been missing

5623986 cyber bullying is not under any definition trespass or theft
5623987 cyber bullying is a relatively new phenomenon as is social networking

5624025 everyone wants to protect their living standard but if everyone does it prices will just go up again as businesses try to cover their higher costs then well all be back to square one but with inflation still high

5624102 saya tahu dia cukup ternama di amerika serikat sana tapi di sini ia jauh lebih besar kharismanya

5624105 knowledge is power every time you understand something that is true about the world you change it because your opinions influence others to change to open their eyes and see things differently
5624106 the impact of rising fuel prices in north america by contrast has been swift and appreciable
5624107 theres absolutely no point in moping about something which you can not significantly change in your current position better to get on with it make shit loads of money like bill gates and start up a fucking or something to help renewable energy or support moon based housing projects or whatever
5624108 i cant stop now ive been doing this forever when i started out all those years ago i wanted to know whether something good could last in a consumer driven world its too late for me to start doing anything else im in a position to do what i like
5624109 there is strong support for prices to drift lower towards 100 a barrel we are only about 10 a barrel away and i wont be surprised to see 105 a barrel by next month
5624110 if you drink and drive youre gonna lose your ride
5624111 this is a very strong and very powerful message to those who think they can do what they like
5624112 before people might lose their licence not even bother getting it back before they get behind the wheel
5624113 there were lots of kids and elderly people around watching
5624114 she was screaming nasty nasty things yelling you didnt stop for me
5624115 she was bleeding from the hands from trying to stop the attack
5624116 when youre carrying a million and a half people each day from time to time youre going to have altercations
5624117 its important to remember how quickly police responded to the situation the system did work
5624118 my client is a 30 year old man who was arrested for taking part in the manufacture of amphetamines
5624119 he was refused bail last thursday and remanded in custody he has never been in prison before
5624120 he was ultimately granted bail last friday having spent the night in custody on remand
5624121 of most concern to me is the fact he was placed as a remand prisoner in g division at yatala because i was told the adelaide remand centre was full the city watchhouse was full and other parts of yatala were full
5624122 according to the prison authorities i spoke to this was the only place they could put him
5624123 personally i find it appalling that anyone who is even serving a sentence is confined to g division unless its for disciplinary reasons because that is why it was built
5624124 but to think that young people are being placed into g division without being found guilty of an offence or sentenced is nothing short of a disgrace
5624125 g division was never built for nor was it ever contemplated that it would be used for remanded prisoners
5624126 if this what the rann governments pack em rack em and stack em policy means then we as a community have some really deep thinking to do
5624127 how would a politician feel if their son or daughter who is entitled to the presumption of innocence until proven guilty was arrested and remanded in g division it would be a different story then i bet
5624128 however the fact that the remandee was refused bail one day and then granted bail the next after he had spent a night in g division feeds growing concern that prison overcrowding was affecting bail decisions
5624129 vigorous condemnation of the use of g division for remand
5624130 bail decisions should be focussed on the prospects of the remandee returning to court not whether the government has got its act together managing cell spaces
5624131 if he had remained in custody instead of getting bail he would have been transferred to an accommodation unit
5624132 g division is used at times to house additional prisoners their stay in g division is kept to an absolute minimum
5624133 they are kept very safe from other prisoners and never come into contact with maximum security prisoners
5624134 were seeing that when these ceramic flat irons are used at the highest heat settings and on a daily basis to achieve straight hair they can really take a toll on the structure of the hair and cause very noticeable problems that can be hard to repair
5624135 if you look at the sales statistics you see that people are pursuing straighter hair with more vigour
5624136 most people on tv and in films have straight hair and its a trend the public is trying to emulate
5624137 the problem starts when they do it wrong or too frequently and they cause a real mess that takes a long time to fix
5624138 kalau allah memanggil saya kapan pun saya sudah siap dengan kematian justru kita bisa dipertemukan dengan sosok yang kita cintai allah
5624139 stole from his victims that which can never be retrieved their innocence
5624140 i think our first step should be to get the united states of america fully engaged
5624141 what is heartening on that question is that both candidates republican and democrat have indicated that they will be moving on this and with an ambitious set of targets
5624142 whether or not the us would be able to get the treaty through congress if in every other respect it acts in accordance to achieve those goals through sovereign actions that in itself would be an incredibly good thing
5624143 i think our officials are working very closely on this to make sure there are no barriers towards linking these schemes and based on my advice there are none
5624144 an area of endeavour for us is what we do domestically on the renewable energy front
5624145 im clear absolutely 100 per cent clear and clean they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer
5624146 i was so mad and i just remember i was just shaking
5624147 pasaba vi luz en lo de mi amigo y me vine
5624148 mr curran replied that the money was in his trust account so nobody gets nothing if he was in jail
5624149 mr lord believed from that that the only way to receive his money back was to facilitate mr curran being released from jail
5624150 the falsities raised by mr lord could be detected with relative ease and were detected with relative ease
5624151 this was offending that struck at the very heart of the proper administration of justice
5624152 this evidence if accepted had the potential to result in a conviction of curran being quashed and a retrial ordered
5624153 si no cambias lo que haces hoy todos tus ma anas ser n como ayer
5624154 americas reputation as an international leader rests in the hands of our youth
5624155 it should be among our top priorities to provide our students with the tools they need to maintain and build upon this standing
5624156 american businesses know that they need a well educated workforce to face growing competition from china india and europe
5624157 the creativity that developed extraordinary new information technologies has not focused on finding ways to make learning more compelling more personal and more productive in our nations schools
5624158 people assumed that the explosion of innovation in information tools in business and service industries would automatically move into classrooms
5624159 education is falling further and further behind the rest of the economy and we have to rethink our basic approach to helping people learn
5624160 vexing demands of educational software has not been economically viable
5624161 todays generation is very comfortable with using tools like ipods and computers and gaming but when they go into the classroom none of that is there and there is this sense of an opportunity we are just not grasping
5624162 if you could teach someone without limits or resources how would you go about it and how would you measure it
5624163 its the kind of thing learning science people dared not think about because it seemed too expensive to tackle
5624164 dari jumlah itu 550 kasus diantaranya adalah penderita aids dan 754 kasus hiv
5624165 my legs feel really good and i can tell my form is there
5624166 the waiting is the worst part i just want to take it on
5624167 its been very emotional watching everyone else do so well even watching some of the heats ive been in tears because we are doing so well and this is such a committed and close knit team
5624168 the whole championships have been like a dream come true for us and i just hope my dream will come true as well
5624169 its just a feeling of total relief because we were expected to win
5624170 another medal wouldnt have been satisfactory for us it had to be gold
5624171 we didnt even realise wed broken the record because we were so focused on just winning
5624172 the time is quicker than i thought it would be i just hate to think how fast well be going come london
5624173 mark is like a pit bull at the moment hes bouncing off the walls back in the village and itching to get on the track
5624174 he woke me up this morning because he was so excited
5624175 anything can happen you can be the strongest team and have a crash early and it can be a lottery
5624176 ive not touched my madison bike since we won the world championships but well be strong
5624177 from the american point of view we wildly mis estimated him and we wildly mis estimated pakistani capabilities
5624178 once the government gets this behind them maybe they can focus on counter terrorism and get back to the business of governing
5624179 the civilian government is pretty divided in how it views relations with the united states
5624180 musharraf for all his flaws was seen as somebody able to manage washingtons demands in pakistan the civilian leadership is seen as all too willing to make concessions to washington including some that in the eyes of the security establishment are untenable
5624181 i just dont think that one person especially given the condition he has been operating in for some time makes that much difference
5624182 that is an opportunity not a liability but it comes at a difficult time
5624183 strengthened its safe haven in pakistans federally administered tribal areas by deepening its alliances with pakistani militants
5624184 now has many of the operational and organizational advantages it once enjoyed across the border in afghanistan albeit on a smaller and less secure scale
5624185 it ends an era marked by great cooperation but unfulfilled expectations
5624186 im definitely going to continue ive still got the belief that i can compete at the top
5624187 i didnt have the best training going into the olympics after injuring my ankle and my ribs but i still managed to get into the final
5624188 there were some great performances by the girls out there and i knew i would have to do something very special to get a medal
5624189 at the start i decided to go for the most difficult routine to give me a chance last week i was just glad to be in the final so i cant be too disappointed with it
5624190 i just had to give it my all so it wasnt as tidy as i planned it to be but i dont think i could have done it another way and this time it just didnt quite work out
5624191 my dismount is n o r m a l l y not a problem but i just didnt get enough height and to be honest i thought i was going to end up on my face
5624192 hopefully the rest of the squad can build on what louis has done follow in his footsteps and in the future we will be competing in more finals for more medals
5624193 there is going to be a change in the coaches after the games so that will freshen things up a bit
5624194 if hes handled properly over the next four years he should generate in excess of 40 million
5624195 phelps will reap the biggest financial reward from water since jaws
5624196 i think michael phelps is a really average swimmer 50 years from now
5624197 he couldnt even make any us team at the time but his parents were geniuses and invented a time machine which they sent him back in time to race against us
5624198 i think they need to seriously consider a time machine dope test i am really sure he is guilty of that
5624199 we are the sprint factory in the world come and see the factory
5624200 jamaica is going crazy euphoric we are blessed little jamaica this is extraordinary and the celebrations will be extraordinary
5624201 it feels great to be in an olympic final i am buzzing
5624202 i am not surprised that i got there because my head was right
5624203 for me getting there it was a case of conquering my demons and saying sod it and just do whatever it takes to get there
5624204 i did not feel the pressure on me and i was in great shape i just went out there gave it my all and got the rewards
5624205 i had a bit of cramp at the beginning of the race now i just hope to get a good drawn in the semi finals
5624206 my olympic experiences have been very mixed and this is another example of that all i can do is keep performing and just see where that takes me
5624207 one of the individuals was handling a firearm and is alleged to have discharged it in the direction of another individual
5624208 she said my friend got shot she said they were fooling around with a gun
5624209 al harith bin miskin entered upon ahmad bin hambal while he was being tortured and narrated
5624210 yusuf bin umar bin yazid narrated to me that malik bin anas said
5624211 but az zuhri was brought out in front of the people had has books hung from his neck
5624212 said bin al musayyib was beaten with a whip and his hair and beard were shaven off and abu az zinad was beaten with a whip as was muhammad bin al munkadir
5624213 do not envy anyone who has not been harmed for the sake of this affair i
5624214 and the people are still being put to trial for the sake of allah and being patient upon that for example the prophets would be killed and the righteous people of the previous nations would be killed and burned alive one of them would even have his flesh combed off of his body with a metal comb and he would remain upon his religion despite this the messenger of allah was poisoned as was abu bakr umar uthman and ali were all killed al hasan was poisoned and al husayn was killed abdullah bin az zubayr ad dahhak bin qays and bin bashir were also all killed and khubayb bin udayy was crucified al hajjaj killed abd ar rahman bin abi layla abd ar rahman bin ghalib al hidani said bin jubayr abu al bukhtari kumayl bin ziyad and crucified mahan al hanafi he had also crucified abdullah bin az zubayr beforehand al wathiq killed ahmad bin nasr and crucified him as for those who were persecuted from the major scholars abd ar rahman bin abi layla he was whipped by al hajjaj over four hundred lashes then al hajjaj killed him abu az zinad was whipped by banu umayyah and abu amr bin al ala was whipped by banu umayyah over five hundred lashes and rabiah was also whipped by banu umayyah atiyyah al awfi was whipped by al hajjaj over four hundred lashes and yazid ad dabiyy was also whipped over four hundred lashes by al hajjaj thabit al binani was whipped by al jarud the successor of ibn ziyad and abdullah bin awn was whipped over seven hundred lashes by bilal bin abi bardah al imam malik bin anas was whipped by al mansur over seventy lashes and abu as sawwar al adawi and uqbah bin abd al ghafir were also lashed several times
5624215 i whipped ahmad bin hambal with over eighty lashes if i had struck an elephant with these lashes they would have caused it to collapse
5624216 in order to afford the fullest possible environmental protection an analysis of the ordinances potential environmental impacts pursuant to ceqa is appropriate and necessary
5624217 it would have been a surprise if they hadnt sued a pleasant surprise
5624218 totally one sided anti plastic bag advocacy document and not an objective or accurate assessment of the environmental impact of banning plastic bags
5624219 the whole basis is for years and years the anti plastic bag activists have been saying anything they want about plastic bags and no one has been responding and now they believe their own misinformation
5624220 respondents have abused their discretion and failed to act in a manner required by ceqa with respect to the ordinance because they have failed to adequately address analyze or otherwise consider the environmental impacts necessary or foreseeable mitigation measures or a reasonable range of alternatives to the ordinance
5624221 i think we did comply with ceqa and i think we made a strong record
5624222 i think its a stretch to say we should be required to prepare an environmental impact report on something like this
5624223 weve done everything if not more and i firmly believe the evidence will support that
5624224 we watched what happened in the city of oakland and they didnt do their homework
5624225 well sue every single one and only for the same reason we want to see a proper environmental impact report
5624226 its all were asking for a report where there is really well researched objective independent information
5624227 its unfortunate that the coalition has taken this stance and even more so after the overwhelming support weve received not just from our residents but our community of local business owners
5624228 they are all aware that the debate is not paper versus plastic
5624229 the goal is moving toward reusable bags im more than disappointed that they think this is worthy of appearing in court over
5624230 while our case has been aggravated by the illegal sanctions imposed by the western powers rising food prices are a world phenomenon because of the use of bio fuel
5624231 but we will continue to fight inflation by making sure that prices charged are realistic
5624232 he requested me as a friend on facebook that was the highlight of my day
5624233 they say im having to work so hard to breathe im just going to give up and sit around in a wheelchair
5624234 he can have the quality of life of a normal person
5624235 you can sit here and tell your friends that this didnt happen but you know it did
5624236 but i forgive you and i do pray you will ask for forgiveness god has something more for you
5624237 if you scan your camera up and down the street you can see the bags and bags of cuttings thats on the street
5624238 its a real dilemma thats facing us and were real concerned about it
5624239 we dont want to cut down our trees and have a bare yard just because we cant accommodate one bin every two weeks the experiment started in mililani hawaii kai which is great but look at our place in aina haina were an old neighborhood 60 years old we have yards and growth that shows 60 years of growth
5624240 were supportive of the recycling program but we just think its going to be a real problem for us
5624241 whether i win or lose the impeachment the nation will lose
5624242 weve said for years that musharraf is our best bet and my fear is that we are about to discover how true that was
5624243 need to be prepared to deal with families who are waiting for a miracle
5624244 sensitivity to this belief will promote development of a trusting relationship
5624245 when youre a parent and youre standing over the body of your child who you think is dying you have to have that
5624246 vindkraften f r en avg rande betydelse om vi ska n eu s m l p kad f rnybar energi
5624247 the latter group women who did not take maternity leave is significantly more likely to have been promoted by june 30 2007
5624248 we are a religiously pluralistic state there are many kinds of people who have to live together in california and i think the court framed this decision to make crystal clear that all patients must receive equal services regardless of the reason that an individual health care practitioner might have for wanting to turn people away
5624249 do the rights of religious freedom and free speech as guaranteed in both the federal and the california constitutions exempt a medical clinics physicians from complying with the california unruh civil rights acts prohibition against discrimination
5624250 californias compelling interest in ensuring full and equal access to medical treatment irrespective of sexual orientation
5624251 this decision may have a big impact on californias proposition 8 the initiative to protect traditional marriage as voters begin to recognize the radical agenda of our opposition
5624252 the ruling is an important one for california and beyond because it stands for the general principle that when you engage in discriminatory conduct in this case the refusal to treat someone in a medical setting based on their sexual orientation you cant claim that conduct has first amendment protection
5624253 you are a business and as a business non discrimination laws apply to you the same way they apply to any business
5624254 this just adds fuel to that fire and underscores the urgency for cultural conservatives at winning where they can win
5624255 we have not seen any significant russian movement out of georgia today
5624256 i wanted to create a policy that would tell everyone how we are going to go about evaluating fire stations
5624257 san jose doesnt have a good policy to determine how to close fire stations
5624258 our group is not opposed to fire station 37 per se what we are opposed to is linking 6 and 37
5624259 i couldnt go to sleep because i was really excited
5624260 but its kind of sad because my brother and all my cousins are still sleeping
5624261 when we came back from the december break the use of time was not as productive as wed like it to have been
5624262 our real job is helping them become a good citizen
5624263 ich habe seit zw lf jahren angemahnt dass junge spieler gef rdert und gefordert werden m ssen
5624264 i dont think were ever going to put the suspicions to bed
5624265 theres always going to be a spore on a grassy knoll
5624266 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5624267 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5624268 women are delaying their childbearing until they complete their educations
5624269 this is the first time weve looked at a lot of these characteristics
5624270 that to me is counter intuitive because a large share of our poor population is latino and they tend to have higher birth rates
5624271 tend to be two parent families and overwhelmingly working and because if youre undocumented youre not eligible for cash assistance programs
5624272 ich habe seit zw lf jahren angemahnt dass junge spieler gef rdert und gefordert werden m ssen
5624273 i was shocked to see he is not supportive of this
5624274 i thought him being an advocate on health and everything i thought this would have been a natural thing for him to support
5624275 this is something that is going to take away from the real work that needs to be done
5624276 if you put together a big wave with small children you get disaster
5624277 so it was really important to have this piece of legislation to regulate the wave pools
5624278 the question before us then becomes at what point do you expect people to exercise a motive of parental responsibility and common sense when going to a water park where the chief object of said water park is to enjoy the waves that it generates
5624279 i think the youth from 12 to 18 are kind of lost they dont know their place in the tribe
5624280 what happened to the girls over at beaver creek sad to say it woke everybody up right its sad to say that it took their deaths to bring our tribe together as one
5624281 we need more parental supervision we need more guidance we need more activities out there that will keep kids involved
5624282 we need a recreation area around here where kids can play basketball
5624283 kids drop out of school and dont finish their education
5624284 i think my daughter tried a little too hard to try to fit in she was an impressionable age
5624285 that seems to be like a normal thing on the reservation like drugs and alcohol and she was exposed to it more and i dont know that she knew how to handle it
5624286 we have a long waiting list of people waiting to go to treatment
5624287 cyber bullying is not under any definition trespass or theft
5624288 cyber bullying is a relatively new phenomenon as is social networking
5624289 it is therefore not surprising that there have been relatively few prosecutions in this area
5624290 as a tool to address all manner of cyber crimes
5624291 moreover the vehicle for the cyber bullying at issue here a social networking web site only became mainstream after 2000
5624292 invites a host of difficult thorny problems and unwanted results
5624293 it is unbelievable how life is so unpredictable and finds a way to distract and derail you from your plans my prayers are with jade her family in this hour when they face one of the biggest tests of their life in times ahead
5624294 i pray she comes out of this soon and stronger hope that she is going back with happy memories from this country
5624295 it is indeed an unfortunate development and we extend full support to jade in this testing time jade is a strong willed woman who has emerged victorious from many battles we sincerely hope that she wins this time as well

5624301 abgesehen davon dass die wienerinnen und wiener durch die beispiellose geb hrenlawine von der roten stadtregierung kr ftig zur kasse gebeten werden k nnen sich auch immer mehr menschen im winter das heizen einfach nicht leisten h upl wehsely und co freuen sich offensichtlich lieber jedes jahr ber neue zuw chse bei der zahl der sozialhilfebezieherinnen statt daf r zu sorgen dass die zahl der bed rftigen in wien endlich zur ck geht

5624314 neuer van der bellen slogan glaubw rdig mit mir nicht
5624315 in ober sterreich sind wir ja gewohnt dass die gr nen wirklich alles mit der vp mitmachen
5624316 dinge gegen die sie fr her vehement auftraten werden jetzt mitgetragen und um sich selbst nicht in frage stellen zu m ssen aus der eigenen wahrnehmung einfach ausgeklammert
5624317 die vp beginnt als erste einen ausl nderfeindlichen wahlkampf was soll das das ist einmalig menschenverachtend und wirtschaftspolitisch dumm was da aufgef hrt wird mit dieser fp politik in schwarzer verkleidung
5624318 absolut wenn die vp glaubt mit fp segeln in den wahlkampf gehen zu m ssen dann ist das alles andere als eine einladung zu einem freundlichen t te t te

5624335 there is one thing we do on earth that we will continue to do in heaven that is to praise and worship god that is why we view life on earth for those who live jesus as choir practise for heaven to say that praise and worship is the most important category of music is an understatement in light of that fact there is no more important activity of the human heart that to praise and worship god
5624336 for us to pretend that things arent happening on the street would be putting blinders on
5624337 we have to get the community re engaged in the lives of young people
5624338 you need to have strong community cohesion you need to have recreational programs or community agencies that are actively dealing with these youth
5624339 what we know is that neighbourhoods that have a lot of community programs tend to do better in terms of preventing gang violence and gangs from emerging in the first place
5624340 theres lower commitment to the gang theyre still in the early stages and theres a romanticized view they like the idea of being a gang member
5624341 it really is a myth to believe that its simply this or simply that
5624342 the record industry is a very political place at the moment
5624343 lots of people have been fired or have taken redundancy laid off recently as the company emi was taken over
5624344 many of these people were people assigned to my projects and now i dont quite know whats going on
5624345 im sure everyone will find their feet soon enough and ill be able to put the album out soon
5624346 i feel like im just using really good technique all the time to move my boat
5624347 thats what weve been trying to do like for the last 13 years why are you worried about it
5624348 its not as hard anymore its physically just as hard but its feeling more natural than it ever has
5624349 the first race of the regatta youre sort of getting used to your surroundings
5624350 watching those guys come through in the clutch was really fantastic and mostly just my feelings for them mostly just that now a bunch of good friends of mine can feel vindicated and feel satisfied
5624351 i know what that feeling of satisfaction feels like in your sport when you finally get what youve been working for for so long and those guys deserved it more than anybody else on the water that day
5624352 i was just looking at some pictures of me in 2002 and i looked a lot younger and i was a lot slimmer
5624353 i wasnt as strong and i wasnt as ambitious and i wasnt as experienced ive won lots more races in the last four years than i did in the previous four years i think im way more prepared this time around
5624354 back in october i didnt even think id make the games it was how am i gonna qualify for this so to come through that then come through the surgery after the championships make it back on more of a time constraint than i wanted to come out with this im really happy im proud of what i did this year and how i pulled through that
5624355 its so hard to believe i just started this sport for fun it wasnt even an olympic sport then it got into the olympics i went to three games i have a third medal
5624356 i do this sport for fun and this is just a bonus and its amazing and im just trying to soak it in
5624357 youd hope that in a technical sport where the performance isnt that long you might be able to beat injury with experience
5624358 of course it would have been nice to get the full three different medals at three olympics but shes not healthy and shes not at her peak career age so to duplicate her results from athens is awesome
5624359 when i was waiting for my score to come up
5624360 i was please let me be in first because from there you know you just wait to see how it pans out
5624361 but theyre all solid performers and i knew my score wasnt the greatest i didnt think it would hold till the end and it didnt
5624362 you have one of the highest calibre athletes right in your own gym so you know what youre striving toward you know where you need to be and what the world level is its great and i love watching her jump
5624363 you need to realize something else you can lead a perfectly good and satisfactory life even if youre not a writer artist when i figured out that i could be perfectly happy and not be a writer i became a better writer the unhappiest people in the world may be the ones who think their happiness depends on artistic success of some kind
5624364 wouldnt it be cool if i took a picture of myself with glitter pouring into my mouth
5624365 haha screw the boring jeans with a plain colored top and flip flops
5624366 it is our routines and our comforts that allow us to ignore social issues for some of us it is our privilege to be ignorant this video tells the story of social issues challenging our privileges and entering our routines making them impossible to ignore social injustice cannot be ignored when you are forced to deal with them that is the idea behind this video what would happen if you were forced to deal with something that you may think has nothing to do with you if suddenly the worlds problems came into your own home you would have to realize that you are connected to everything and everyone one earth
5624367 there aint no reason things are this way its how they always been and they intend to stay i cant explain why we live this way we do it everyday
5624368 take it or leave it i cant do this god
5624369 this is the last sighting we currently have of the victim prior to the incident
5624370 the footage shows the victim is wearing a light coloured sleeveless jacket
5624371 my first decision as chief executive of the port adelaide footy club is to jump off the crows
5624372 im the newest recruit to the power and very very excited about what lies ahead
5624373 over the years i really have admired the port adelaide football club and everything it stands for
5624374 i really feel privileged to be leading the footy club as we go forward
5624375 this business is all about brands and people and im very passionate about both
5624376 i really like a challenge as well and i think theres lot of challenges here at the footy club
5624377 mark haysman is a proven manager of people and brands with a strong customer and sponsorship focus in the highly competitive national brewing market
5624378 foleys probably done a little bit more today in our skills session just from a running point of view than what browny did
5624379 browny was still stationary today but its only early in the week so well give both those boys an opportunity to come up later in the week
5624380 id sort of say that nathan foleys ahead of nathan brown at the minute
5624381 their contested footy games improved and their clearance footy games improved immeasurably in the second half of the year which makes them a more dangerous item than what they perhaps were in the first half of the year so we dont take them lightly
5624382 its important for our guys to know they can compete with sides that have been right up there for the entire year so i think that thats really important
5624383 i think also from a direction point of view as much as i can sit there and say that i believe in our younger group of players and i think were very even in a group of players that are coming through
5624384 we are absolutely delighted that neale has accepted this position with the west coast eagles
5624385 we were looking for someone with a strong coaching and administrative background and identified neale as the best person for this role
5624386 its an exciting challenge and a great time to begin with the west coast eagles
5624387 i believe the club is well positioned to rebound quickly from what has been a disappointing season particularly given its proud history email this article

5624393 will my child suffer or worse end up an axe murderer due to this time apart
5624394 the kids that turn out the best in the world have a strong attachment to their parents
5624395 he was in a car accident i think a couple years ago which caused him trauma to the head
5624396 he was basically very badly injured which caused him to have to take medication that morning he was distraught related to the whole lawsuit pending to the car injury situation it really made him very very upset and that kind of set him off is my guess
5624397 until we have more we dont know whether or not theres a crime involved
5624398 were waiting for the coroner to tell us whether he was medicated or not
5624399 it can take up to three to six weeks to determine manner and cause of death

5624418 i might get distracted for a moment and forget about it and then come back to it and think how did i do that
5624419 i was just so excited to make the australian team then to get to the olympics then to make the semis and then the final to go one step further is more that i could have ever thought of
5624420 you only ever dream about winning a medal but the dream only went as far as the podium not beyond
5624421 i was so nervous and emotional before my first race and if someone even wished me luck i would get a tear in my eye
5624422 i was just so scared that i would make a fool of myself and stuff it up

5624443 it came at 2 02 pm three quarters of an hour into a speech that kept the nation on tenterhooks president musharraf bowed to the inevitable and announced his resignation here at last was the moment the overwhelming majority of the countrys politicians had been hoping for
5624444 most will wonder why it took the president so long some will rue the lost opportunity to impeach him what is incontestable is that the country must move on from this crisis quickly
5624445 the inevitable has happened left with no options president musharraf has stepped down his reign of nearly nine years has ended the nation has heard him speak for the very last time as head of state
5624446 the fact is that musharraf who perhaps at the start of his tenure set out to serve pakistan with greater sincerity than others who came before him left a considerable mark on the country in the end his belief that he alone was a saint and all others villains worthy of little respect was a key factor in his undoing
5624447 he was in control of himself he was confident and assured neither bitter nor crowing he did not lash out at the coalition government he did not curse the role of media whose freedom he had made possible and which turned against him in the bitter end and he did not criticise the lawyers movement that is baying for his blood
5624448 finally it was the incumbency factor that got him staying on in power beyond five or six years is simply not an option
5624449 there is no gain saying that the final decision must have been a tough moment for musharraf but then he was left with very few choices
5624450 the day climaxing a silent revolution will go down as a major landmark of our history and may leave some important lessons for those who had been used to nursing bonapartist notions

5624461 i cant be like this this is not me im letting my team down somethings got to happen and ive got to be the one to do it
5624462 ill have to talk to our people to see if hes healthy before making a true evaluation
5624463 when i saw the replay there was a flinch by reyes
5624464 i dont feel like i can rear back and get a fastball by anybody
5624465 the velocity is not there ive never been a guy to paint the black anyways but i cant get behind it when i want to
5624466 its the playoff race so youve got to suck it up
5624467 i feel like i can still help the team out
5624468 he got jammed up and tried to go right back in we just didnt think he should
5624469 i cant imagine a person who would hate india more than you
5624470 no sorry youve given the impression of a complete lack of competence and no i will not leave my passport here
5624471 since the detroit game getting my feet in bounds is something we have practiced
5624472 it is something i need to do better every day after practice we work on it i even talked to amani and plax about how they get their feet down in bounds
5624473 he has taken snaps with the first team all training camp he has been making plays for us and his work paid off it was really a great job on both of them of getting his feet down
5624474 that gave him the hat trick in the first quarter
5624475 the tough job is the blocking all i had to do is run
5624476 if they offered a straight up trade i think id keep eli
5624477 he led us to a super bowl what else do you want him to do
5624478 our goal for the whole season is to come out and play well at home
5624479 last year 3 5 we didnt play well at home
5624480 i can see a combination of 30 sacks between both of us
5624481 i really havent noticed ive been in albany my jobs to worry about the giants and get us to win games and play good football
5624482 im not saying well have this tonight but when he is healthy we have a professional rbi guy in the lineup
5624483 when he is healthy he knows how to knock in runs
5624484 there werent that many expectations but he got through it because hes a tough guy its almost like he can will himself
5624485 hitting with runners in scoring position we all know thats been our weakness all year
5624486 i wish it were easy to predict it would change we just need to be better
5624487 you can expect those guys to contribute because theyve done it before
5624488 you cant change anything thats happened but we just need to be consistent and win
5624489 you try to forget about it and just try to move forward you need to be consistent we feel we have a good team here we have to prove it over the last 38 games
5624490 i dont want to think i want to react theres got to be some middle ground there thats what were trying to find im trying to get as much digested as possible
5624491 a lot of times you can make this as complicated as you want to
5624492 some of the terms we used in green bay we use here but they mean something totally different
5624493 im up to the challenge and i hope this thing works out
5624494 we all knew how quickly that can fade i dont want to come here and fail i want to come here and play well for me and for this team and in the process bring some energy to the fans
5624495 im not here to replace chad pennington as a person im here as the new quarterback of the jets i told laveranues i think itll work out that being a friend of chad is not going to change im not here to replace him im here to throw you passes ill do my best to get passes to you thats all i can do and thats all i can say
5624496 everybody tells you just to go but its kind of hard when you dont know where to go
5624497 going back to the browns game it was kind of rough
5624498 since then ive really picked up on it im a little more comfortable out there some things im actually picking up off the pre snap read and jumping on it
5624499 its just one of those things where youll be out there and sooner or later youll realize youre making plays and youre not thinking at all
5624500 i was able to not think so much and just go out and play
5624501 i was able to settle down and play as opposed to being out there running around like i had my head cut off i had a little more fun against the redskins
5624502 i felt some nervousness out there but that will soon go away getting game experience is what its all about you get a better gauge of yourself i want to use this game and keep improving
5624503 hes converting from basically being a down end to a stand up outside linebacker
5624504 theres a transition there that happens the longer he is here and the more comfortable he gets with the system hes going to be fine
5624505 theres been some times where you see the pass rush ability the raw power
5624506 hes got very strong hands hes got a great ability to control the line of scrimmage those traits just naturally come out especially in a one on one drill or something where its less processing but you want to see it translate into the game and into the practices and it will come

5624527 this house believes that we can solve our energy problems with existing technologies today without the need for breakthrough innovations
5624528 the world must deploy staggering amounts of low carbon energy technology as rapidly as possible

5624532 correct your acid alkaline balance with the water you drink what the experts say
5624533 why destroy the people who are with us this is not imperialism or a foreign invasion i tell my brothers that if there was a benefit and a need to carry arms i will be the first to arm you train and fight along with you
5624534 from today bahanga and i are at your disposal we consider libya alone can resolve the rebellions in mali and niger
5624535 as a matter of urgency to restore political stability in zimbabwe
5624536 we need this inclusive government to drive this process of addressing these challenges
5624537 it is mind boggling it is like putting a gun to somebodys head it is extraordinary that you put pressure on the mugabe regime by removing such pressure
5624538 mbekis handling of the process is one of the most painful things i have experienced in my life
5624539 generally women in zimbabwe have experienced more trauma after 1980 than pre independence
5624540 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5624541 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5624542 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5624543 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5624544 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5624545 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5624546 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5624547 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5624548 he didnt say anything about watering and i usually do it for him when hes away
5624549 not like him to let weeds grow and theres tomatoes there with great side shoots want removing and his beans need picking you think hes ok
5624550 unless he did his back in doing all that digging for you not trying to get some extra business for your old practice are you
5624551 dont worry bert i was just teasing i know youre always advising people to take care of themselves you wouldnt have let the lad overdo it hell be on holiday again i expect
5624552 yes please ill come and let you in it might take a while
5624553 oh dear ian youre in a bad way i feel terrible
5624554 yes but it was because of all the digging you did for me
5624555 no bert it wasnt i have been away from the allotment but thats because of work not my back this only happened a few days ago well i say happened but actually i just woke up with it
5624556 nothing i havent seen him back pain is pretty common isnt it anyway theres nothing they can do
5624557 it is common yes about three out of four people will have back pain at least once usually no treatment is needed but you might find painkillers helpful
5624558 i did have some but ive run out when i said there was something you could do for me it was to fetch some more and some milk if you wouldnt mind
5624559 would you get my wallet for me its in my briefcase in the corner if you wouldnt mind taking my keys with you ill just go back to bed
5624560 is that what youve been doing since the pain began
5624561 yes it doesnt hurt so bad when i lie down and youre supposed to rest a bad back arent you i remember my dad had this and he had to rest
5624562 when i was a gp thats what we recommended but theyve now realised that was wrong the best advice is to carry on with normal activities as much as possible
5624563 oh i suppose i should have checked with the doctor
5624564 if you like ill take a look at you and check it is just simple lower back pain
5624565 no it can be extremely painful but usually it starts to ease fairly soon
5624566 now youve already said it started suddenly do you have any other symptoms such as pain in your chest a weakness in your legs or feet or trouble going to the toilet
5624567 no just the pain in my back its worse if i move and eases a bit if i lie still
5624568 thats whats called mechanical back pain there can be various causes such as lifting something heavy or a muscle strain but sometimes theres no obvious reason for it as theres no test to reveal the pain it can often be difficult to pinpoint the exact area thats affected for that reason its often known as non specific lower back pain
5624569 take the painkillers which ill get for you now then when theyre working start walking about a bit ill explain more when ive been to the shops
5624570 give them a chance to work and then try walking about a bit but dont do too much ive put a few things in your fridge so get yourself something to eat ill get down my allotment now but id like to come back later and see how you are
5624571 thanks bert although i dont know what the neighbours will be thinking
5624572 so how quick will i get over this and get back to work and more importantly down the allotment
5624573 gradually build up how much you do try going for a walk tomorrow and see how it goes youre the best judge of how much you can do you can drive and work once the pain eases but start gradually and dont overdo things ill look after your allotment dont worry about that you come down as soon as you can though as i dont think i can keep it up to your usual standard
5624574 youll need that water for your next lot of painkillers even if youre not thirsty by then
5624575 ouch i dont think ill forget to take the painkillers should i do anything else hot water bottles or a visit to a chiropractor or anything like that
5624576 anything that makes you more comfortable is fine but painkillers and gradually getting back to normal activity levels are all you really need some people say they gain short term relief from a visit to a physiotherapist or chiropractor for physical manipulation but im not sure thats really needed either the pain should begin to ease in a few days if it doesnt then contact your gp also contact him if you feel pain or numbness in your leg or foot
5624577 it could be a sign of sciatica or trapped nerve it could also indicate damage to one of the discs between the vertebrae
5624578 right could back pain be a symptom of something more serious
5624579 yes but rarely if this pain first developed when you were under twenty or over fifty five id be concerned also if it was associated with bowel or bladder problems or didnt ease after resting that might suggest another underlying condition
5624580 arthritis is a possibility or the back pain could be associated with another medical condition if you were suffering from cancer or were hiv positive then youd certainly need to see your gp
5624581 none of that applies to me so i hope ill soon be better
5624582 so do i lad im sure you will but if the pain doesnt ease see your gp and if you get any of the other symptoms i mentioned then call right away
5624583 there is a rare but serious condition called cauda equina syndrome symptoms include bowel or bladder trouble and numbness around the anus and weakness in the legs if its not treated quickly then it can result in permanent nerve damage as i said its rare but if you do get those symptoms then its important you get treatment quickly
5624584 my back feels fine now bert i wouldnt want to go through that again though is there anything i can do to stop it recurring
5624585 the general advice is to keep active you dont need to do special exercises just do normal activities
5624586 dont worry bert i dont think youve been making patients for your old firm
5624587 if this pain first developed when you were under twenty or over fifty five or was associated with bowel or bladder problems or didnt ease after resting or if you were suffering from cancer or were hiv positive then youd certainly need to see your gp

5624589 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5624590 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5624591 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5624592 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5624593 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5624594 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5624595 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5624596 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5624597 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5624598 e tu pi avanti che gettavi lancora e che mi aspettavi noi
5624599 well of course darling thats exactly how you get girls now if you want a
5624600 uh huh i dig them as much as my annual colonoscopy
5624601 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5624602 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5624603 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5624604 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5624605 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5624606 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5624607 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5624608 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5624609 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5624610 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5624611 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5624612 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5624613 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5624614 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5624615 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5624616 who are open to doing something on the production side
5624617 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5624618 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5624619 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5624620 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5624621 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5624622 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5624623 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5624624 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5624625 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5624626 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5624627 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5624628 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5624629 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5624630 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5624631 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5624632 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5624633 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5624634 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5624635 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5624636 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5624637 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5624638 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5624639 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5624640 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5624641 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5624642 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5624643 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5624644 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5624645 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5624646 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5624647 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5624648 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5624649 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5624650 wir vertrauen weiter auf die technologie und konzentrieren uns nun zun chst auf die verl ngerung der bestehenden strecke in shanghai
5624651 die halbjahresergebnisse waren zweifellos entt uschend die margen kamen durch stark gestiegene rohstoff und energiekosten die allein im zweiten quartal um 10 prozent gestiegen sind immens unter druck besonders stark war der anstieg im april und mai ab mitte juni gelang es uns jedoch die h heren kosten mit verkaufspreiserh hungen zu kompensieren weitere signifikante preiserh hungen setzten sich auch im juli durch
5624652 die wirtschaftlichen bedingungen werden auch im zweiten halbjahr sehr anspruchsvoll in einigen m rkten vor allem in europa sp ren wir einen konjunkturr ckgang w hrend wir in anderen regionen allen voran in asien wo wir gut positioniert sind weiterhin solides wachstum sehen basierend auf unseren gegenw rtigen markteinsch tzungen der entwicklung der rohstoffkosten und wechselkurse gehen wir davon aus dass der im ersten quartal kommunizierte ausblick erreichbar ist diese einsch tzung st tzt sich auf die verbesserung der margen aufgrund von verkaufspreiserh hungen die sich im zweiten halbjahr auswirken werden f r den fall dass sich das wirtschaftliche umfeld weiter jedoch verschlechtert k nnten die ergebnisse schw cher ausfallen als wir zum jetzigen zeitpunkt erwarten
5624653 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5624654 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5624655 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5624656 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5624657 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5624658 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5624659 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5624660 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5624661 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5624662 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5624663 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5624664 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5624665 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5624666 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5624667 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5624668 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5624669 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5624670 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5624671 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

5624681 when we came into these games i thought that maybe we would have four victories from the seven preliminaries
5624682 but unexpectedly i think we are fortunate because since we beat the u s in a very tough first game the good luck has stayed with us and we have won all our games
5624683 before we came to these olympic games people were talking that the u s cuba and japan are very strong
5624684 but no matter whether a team is strong or weak there are many factors that can affect results
5624685 when we were little george and i used to share a bedroom as we got older he was given the room all to himself and after he left it was used by other family members but was always vacated when george returned home to visit
5624686 it was always known as georges room and our mum never let us forget that
5624687 everyone in the family is sad to see it go it was a very happy home and my father lived there for nearly 60 years but we all have our own houses now and it was a stipulation of dads will that the house should be sold on his death
5624688 dickey looked after the house meticulously over the years it has phoenix gas central heating and double glazing with a new kitchen put in recently
5624689 we have priced it as a very well tended terrace in the cregagh estate a similar property in burren way went sale agreed recently for around this price but this house has a bigger back garden
5624690 there is a moderate risk of further disruption across northern ireland during monday as a result of further outbreaks of fairly heavy rain especially during the afternoon and evening
5624691 outbreaks of heavy rain will affect eastern parts of northern ireland giving 15 mm in 3 hours in places
5624692 the showers are expected to continue for most of the week however they should become lighter and more scattered across northern ireland
5624693 they will be on and off and it will become a little bit brighter
5624694 the rain over the next day or so should not be as heavy as was seen during the weekend

5624702 i guess theyre going to hitch their wagon to him and just ride him off into the sunset
5624703 i always knew he was a good athlete but most pitchers lets be honest cant hit he can swing the bat a little bit i just wish i could have hit some home runs in front of him instead of making him run like that
5624704 i was just looking for something out over the plate trying to put a good swing on it put it in play
5624705 he threw me a curveball and i was able to flip it to left
5624706 ive got to tip my cap because it was a slider down and away i looked at the video 100 times and ill probably see it 100 times when im not sleeping tonight he really helped himself out there its frustrating when something like that happens
5624707 it was a little awkward but i was just trying to get in scoring position
5624708 i like to hit but i think since ive been here the more i hit the worse ive been getting
5624709 hes definitely confident in his hitting abilities and for the right a good hitter
5624710 she does a lot of things for us especially offensively

5624712 i had a really bad start it was very hard to focus when my competitors were gaining points on me

5624716 i was lucky because the second place swedish guy was very close to goodison so goodison was watching him and keeping him behind pity for him but it left just three of us for two other medals

5624728 hogans legal arguments are unsupported by case authority and without merit
5624729 here as the party challenging the summonses hogan has the heavy burden of rebutting the governments good faith showing
5624730 he has failed to carry that burden with naked arguments and bald assertions without evidence in support of such allegations are insufficient to rebut a prima facie case for summons enforcement
5624731 first hogan is wrong because the summonses do not seek tax returns
5624732 second hogan is wrong because resident status is not the test for whether an investigation is unnecessary

5624755 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5624756 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5624757 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5624758 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority
5624759 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies

5624784 hes actually returning us to the dark ages and making the guys that live in this town seem like sex starved men that will pounce upon the first girl they see
5624785 it paints the women here as second rate and suggests the men will settle for anything
5624786 theres a lot of anger among the community at the moment a lot of passionate anger

5624793 were currently carrying out enquiries into how this crash happened gathering evidence from the scene and speaking to witnesses
5624794 this is likely to take some time given the nature of the incident and the diverse background of those involved we have a number of interpreters helping us and our officers are currently liaising with the relevant embassies to keep them fully informed
5624795 we apologise for any inconvenience this causes to local residents and alton towers visitors and would encourage those planning a trip later today to check the latest travel news or alton towers website
5624796 i heard this massive crash and rumble crunching metal it sounded initially like a thunderstorm but then we heard shouts and screams
5624797 from what i could see a coach had crashed at the hill and ploughed through a neighbours garden it ploughed through two cars parked in a driveway one of them was bouncing down the road the other must have flown along with the coach
5624798 it must have dropped about 20ft it was on a slope there were people climbing out of the fire exits on the bus the majority were walking wounded
5624799 theres a bad bend at the bottom of the hill which is in line with the neighbours driveway they couldnt have managed to take the corner and had no choice but to go through
5624800 its an extremely dangerous road a narrow country road its mayhem absolute mayhem we had a torrential downpour just before it happened i was in the pub when someone came in screaming for blankets and sheets we all went to help but the area had been cordoned off

5624812 the distribution of wealth is skewed and levels of inequality are now higher than at any time since the gilded age
5624813 while the median wage and salary income of the average worker showed literally no gain the income of the top hundredth of a percent went up almost 500
5624814 the first priority is to provide practical and political support to georgia
5624815 ensure russia does not learn the wrong lessons from the events of the last two weeks force cannot be the basis for the demarcation of new lines around russia
5624816 we hope that tomorrows decisions by nato will be balanced and that responsible forces in the west will give up the total cynicism that has been so evident which is pushing us back to the cold war era

5624818 if it means the difference between being selected and not then i would probably sign the contract
5624819 it would be quite wrong to say that we could ever license a system of law for some community which gave people no right of appeal no way of exercising the rights that are guaranteed to them as citizens in general but there are ways of looking at marital disputes for example which provide an alternative to the divorce courts as we understand them i n some cultural and religious settings they would seem more appropriate
5624820 it was not violence and we would oppose all violence against any persons
5624821 often the homosexual movement will fly the flag of you lot are intolerant and you hide behind the bible could there be anything more intolerant than the clear victimisation of iris robinson tonight through these posters
5624822 these guys are allowed to come out and say whatever they want to say and we cant stand in front of them with a banner
5624823 many of our participants noticed that their computers were slowing down this means that while they were surfing unbeknownst to them websites were installing malware
5624824 spam is most definitely much more than a nuisance its a very real and fast growing threat
5624825 our participants came from all walks of life from all over the world and given their interest to take part in the experiment they were well aware of the problem despite this they were all shocked by the sheer amount of spam they attracted
5624826 we can see from the experiment that spam is undeniably linked to cybercrime
5624827 ministers are discovering that an it based scheme conceived at the centre cannot be imposed on a devolved nhs a lesson that should have been learned from failures in the 1990s
5624828 it is clear from this report that the setting of unrealistic deadlines has been very damaging
5624829 slipping deadlines for new it systems and the premature release of systems that are not fit for purpose has been deeply frustrating for nhs staff leaving many doctors thoroughly disillusioned with the programme
5624830 the current timetables for the care records system to be fully deployed by 2014 15 had better be realistic
5624831 the department of health cannot afford further knocks to the programmes reputation or our confidence in it
5624832 and while some have proposed escalating this war by adding thousands of more troops there is little reason to believe that this will achieve these results either
5624833 to reach such a solution we must communicate clearly and effectively to the factions in iraq that the days of asking urging and waiting for them to take control of their own country are coming to an end
5624834 over the last couple of years weve learned the book experience is key
5624835 the xo2 will be a bit of a trojan horse
5624836 currently developing nations such as china and brazil are spending 19 per student per year on books
5624837 there is no question that demand goes up when you offer dual boot
5624838 its down to the airlines to decide whether they want to fit the systems then they would have to get approval for that
5624839 it doesnt get much better than their bringing us a picture of the guy actually using the stolen property
5624840 it certainly made our job easier the fact that they knew who these guys were certainly added solvability
5624841 she said i dont know what youre talking about and her friend said well you popped up as being online
5624842 when you take a picture with that computer it shows a countdown and when it does this guy figures out whats going on
5624843 it all clicks for him and he puts his hand up to cover the lens but it was too late she had already taken the picture
5624844 its certainly a great use of what was probably meant as a business product
5624845 but if she had taken the picture and didnt know who he was we wouldnt be in the same place as far as the investigation goes
5624846 i do not believe we are going to be able to stabilize the situation without that
5624847 i continue to believe that the original decision to go into iraq was a massive strategic blunder that the two problems you pointed out al qaida in iraq and increased iranian influence in the region are a direct result of that original decision
5624848 i will meet not just with our friends but with our enemies not just with those we agree with but those we dont
5624849 we have no opinion on the arab arab conflicts like your border disagreement with kuwait
5624850 i know i have seen the desperation and disorder of the powerless
5624851 project president bad hair and botox on the road to the white house
5624852 i will stand with the muslims should the political winds change in an ugly direction
5624853 with the splitting and eclipse of christianity man began to worship a new deity the nation the nation became a mystical object claiming mans love and loyalty the nation state along with the doctrine of national sovereignty fragmented humanity it could not provide a rational framework within which the relations between nations could develop
5624854 represents a further vital and creative stage in the maturing and mans universal vision
5624855 was the most powerful doctrine for generating a universal and secular human consciousness
5624856 although stalinism may have been a needless tragedy for both the russian people and communism as an ideal there is the intellectually tantalizing possibility that for the world at large it was a blessing in disguise
5624857 ponder this shocking statement about islam or of islamic imperialism yes it slaughtered more than 200 million people but islam brought hundreds of christian jewish zoroastrian hindu and buddhist communities under a single universal vision that of the quran
5624858 will have as much access and influence over the course and direction of our campaign that has traditionally been reserved for the wealthy and the powerful
5624859 kens a smart guy and i guess hes done the math and decided that barack is the best candidate
5624860 this is the first time ive ever gotten involved in this kind of work in a campaign
5624861 people are doing this because they believe in this candidate
5624862 in this campaign outsized influence is given to the small donors
5624863 he said he didnt realize he was going to have so little time
5624864 i was very impressed that someone trying to build a national team would reach out like that
5624865 barack called me and said i really need your help
5624866 but i just found him to be totally captivating and moving
5624867 i stand in agreement with what he has said about the iraq war those who work in the defense industry are extremely focused on the national defense
5624868 my interest in him is i think hes inspirational i think he will enormously improve our economy and our relations with other countries
5624869 i was inclined to vote for hillary but when i heard obamas criticism about gambling i thought about changing my vote now im not sure what to do
5624870 but if the tax became too high as a matter of principle i would not be working this hard
5624871 if there was ever a doubt that washington lobbyists dont actually represent real americans its the fact that they stopped leaders of both parties from requiring elite investment firms to pay their fair share of taxes
5624872 have a strong interest in becoming involved in the political process and that is really the whole story behind their support of obama
5624873 in their analysis and they have good analysts obama is likely to be successful so it is very much in their advantage to have a strong voice with him
5624874 and so my brothers and sisters i ask you to heed this call make a stand for truth justice unity and democracy i am confident that we will be victorious in our struggles for it is a battle that is half won the filipino people are already convinced that mrs arroyo cheated and lied in the last elections and that it is time for her to go
5624875 if the president is serious in giving due recognition to msus contribution to peace and development in mindanao she should appoint someone to the academe on the basis of merit via the institutionalized process of the search committee this to me is military imperialism the way the military is being exported to all areas of civilian life including in the academe this is very very dangerous
5624876 the search for truth must continue and must be guided by the principles of the rule of law provided for in the constitution and by the moral principles of justice and the common good
5624877 certain allegations have cast serious doubts on the electoral victory of the president in the recent elections unfortunately the only avenue by which to evaluate that evidence and to vindicate the president the impeachment process was abruptly closed this has severely impaired her credibility and has made it virtually impossible for her to unite and govern the country effectively
5624878 democracy often demands that each of us make a stand to take risks just as i am doing now
5624879 is no less than a moral and credibility issue that touches on the very essence of the presidents ability to lead and govern the nation
5624880 we must not only put more food in the basket but must also ensure through asset reforms that the people who produce those food have enough for themselves
5624881 the central issue in agriculture and agrarian reform is the productivity of land use not simply land ownership i am firmly committed to answering the centuries old dream of land for the landless my long term objective is an internationally competitive agricultural sector that will increase our resource based export earnings feed our growing population improve the livelihood of our rural countrymen while meeting our objectives of environmental preservation
5624882 the national anti poverty action agenda stands as a covenant between the government and the basic sectors it is our common understanding on the causes and solutions to poverty with its affirmative bias for the poor the action agenda also serves as an enabling and empowering tool for the basic sectors it compels the decision makers of our country to directly hear their voices on issues concerning the poor sectors they represent the naaa moves us one step forward in the fight against poverty
5624883 not simply the lack of material resources but also the absence of capabilities opportunities and power that will allow an individual to fully assume his or her role as a member of the community
5624884 cut off separated or excluded from the mainstream of everyday cultural political and economic life is the crucial aspect that gives depth and credence to the new concept of poverty
5624885 a philippine society where everyone possesses capabilities opportunities power and sufficient resources that will enable them to participate in democratic governance work in harmony with their ecosystems enjoy the fruits of sustained and equitable development and live peacefully in their communities
5624886 substantive and sizable amount of the national budget shall be allocated in support of the flagship programs and projects
5624887 we are at the heart and essence of land reform reform of private agricultural lands will have a big impact in redistributing wealth and in creating a more equitable society it also allows us to set up creative partnerships and joint ventures between farmers the public sector and agribusiness firms for greater farm productivity
5624888 although an important start a democratically elected government is not enough however the challenge now is to ensure that democratic practices and principles permeate every level and dimension of society when it comes to eradicating poverty political reform is not an option it is an imperative
5624889 a socially cohesive and caring asean where hunger malnutrition deprivation and poverty are no longer basic problems where strong families as the basic units of society tend to their members particularly the children youth women and elderly and where the civil society is empowered and gives special attention to the disadvantaged disabled and marginalized and where social justice and rule of law reign
5624890 are not favors or acts of charity to be bestowed on the poor
5624891 recognize the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest standard of physical and mental health
5624892 reduction of the stillbirth rate and of infant mortality and for the healthy development of the child
5624893 primary education shall be compulsory and available free to all
5624894 recognize the right of the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health and to facilities of treatment of illness andrehabilitation of health
5624895 specific educational information to help ensure the health and well being of families
5624896 most countries have more than enough resources needed to eradicate income poverty and to provide basic social services for all
5624897 virtuous circle between economic growth income poverty and social development
5624898 although an important start a democratically elected government is not enough however the challenge now is to ensure that democratic practices and principles permeate every level and dimension of society when it comes to eradicating poverty political reform is not an option it is an imperative
5624899 a socially cohesive and caring asean where hunger malnutrition deprivation and poverty are no longer basic problems where strong families as the basic units of society tend to their members particularly the children youth women and elderly and where the civil society is empowered and gives special attention to the disadvantaged disabled and nmarginalized and where social justice and rule of law reign

5624906 the vast majority of viable spectrum in this country simply goes unused or else is grossly underutilised
5624907 unlike other natural resources there is no benefit to allowing this spectrum to lie fallow
5624908 under no circumstances may a candidate receive approval to make a campaign or election related statement or to respond to a campaign or election related media query
5624909 the candidate may appear on camera and in photographs as an official participant and may make a statement or answer questions about the official business being conducted
5624910 id rather take them out of it rather than be seen as exploiting them lets not politicize the troops
5624911 at the height of the cold war my father decided like so many others in the forgotten corners of the world that his yearning his dream required the freedom and opportunity promised by the west
5624912 and so he wrote letter after letter to universities all across america until somebody somewhere answered his prayer for a better life
5624913 and you know that the only reason we stand here tonight is because men and women from both of our nations came together to work and struggle and sacrifice for that better life
5624914 the size of our forces was no match for the much larger soviet army and yet retreat would have allowed communism to march across europe
5624915 where the last war had ended another world war could have easily begun all that stood in the way was berlin
5624916 people of the world look at berlin look at berlin where germans and americans learned to work together and trust each other less than three years after facing each other on the field of battle
5624917 look at berlin where a victory over tyranny gave rise to nato the greatest alliance ever formed to defend our common security
5624918 people of the world look at berlin where a wall came down a continent came together and history proved that there is no challenge too great for a world that stands as one
5624919 while the 20th century taught us that we share a common destiny the 21st has revealed a world more intertwined than at any time in human history
5624920 you can take your diploma walk off this stage and chase only after the big house and the nice suits and all the other things that our money culture says you should but i hope you dont
5624921 fulfilling your immediate wants and needs betrays a poverty of ambition
5624922 our collective service can shape the destiny of this generation
5624923 barack obama will require you to work he is going to demand that you shed your cynicism that you come out of your isolation that you move out of your comfort zone barack obama will never allow you to go back to your lives as usual uninvolved uninformed
5624924 we cant drive our suvs and eat as much as we want and keep our homes on 72 degrees at all times and then just expect that other countries are going to say ok
5624925 inside a landfill there is little oxygen and little moisture under these conditions trash does not break down very rapidly in fact when old landfills have been excavated or sampled 40 year old newspapers have been found with easily readable print
5624926 that a reader in the know informs me that michelle obamas thesis
5624927 has been temporarily withdrawn until after this years presidential election in november
5624928 attempts to retrieve the document through princeton proved unsuccessful with school librarians having been pestered so much for access to the thesis that they have resorted to reading from a script when callers inquire about it
5624929 the obama campaign however quickly responded to a request for the thesis by politico
5624930 predominantly white universities like princeton are socially and academically designed to cater to the needs of the white students comprising the bulk of their enrollments
5624931 activities organized by university groups such as student government rarely if ever take into account the diverse interests which exist at a university that is not 100 white
5624932 there is only one major university recognized organization on campus designed specifically for the intellectual interests of black and other third world students
5624933 there is a distinctive black culture very different from white culture elements of black culture which make it unique from white culture such as its music its language the struggles and a consciousness shared by its people may be attributed to the injustices and oppressions suffered by this race of people which are not comparable to the experiences of any other race of people through this countrys history not even american indians however with the increasing integration of blacks into the mainstream society many integrated blacks have lost touch with black culture in their attempts to become adjusted and comfortable in their new culture the white culture some of these blacks are no longer able to enjoy the qualities which make black culture so unique or are unable to openly share their culture with other blacks because they have become so far removed from these experiences and in some instances ashamed of them as a result of their integration p54
5624934 for the first time in my adult life i am proud of my country because it feels like hope is finally making a comeback
5624935 hes spending an awful lot of time talking about me you notice that
5624936 i havent seen an ad yet where he talks about what hes going to do and the reason is because those folks know they dont have any good answers they know theyve had their turn over the last eight years and made a mess of things
5624937 they know that youre not real happy with them and so the only way they figure theyre going to win this election is if they make you scared of me
5624938 what theyre saying is well we know were not very good but you cant risk electing obama
5624939 if he reconvenes the dialogue it will only be for the purposes of persuading tsvangirai to sign the deal that is on the table which the mdc leader has thus far refused to do
5624940 he mbeki is unlikely to reopen the dialogue on the substantive issues because he spent almost a week in zimbabwe and failed to get tsvangirai and mugabe to find common ground
5624941 there is no sign that the parties would change their positions
5624942 i dont know where that news comes from we himself and parreira talk a lot and he has not told me anything
5624943 were very good friends and ill receive him with a big hug
5624944 we arent worried about what outside people are saying everything that is needed to be done for the world cup will be done and we need the support of everyone parreira coming back is good because he has worked with the squad for 17 months and were trying to keep going what he has done
5624945 its very important to give the players experience ahead of the world cup and we are going to do that in this match
5624946 i dont like losing but i wouldnt want to play ugly and win id love to play well and hopefully victory will come from that thats what i want and the players want that too because south african football is very similar to that of brazil beautiful
5624947 when we played the africa cup angola 2010 qualifiers we played very good games but we just need to improve on scoring goals
5624948 my idea from the qualifiers was to keep the same team but with tshepo masilela and steven pienaar out we have to change the team so nasief morris and benni mccarthy will start against the socceroos
5624949 a world vision and a call for revolution for the workers of survival who could if organized reshape the world
5624950 to advance the unity of working people to be a voice to be reckoned with by the obama administration which to me at this point looks like will be an overwhelming landslide victory over the republicans
5624951 oft in the silence of the night when the lonely moon rides high when wintry winds are whistling and we hear the owls shrill cry in the quiet dusky chamber by the flickering firelight rising up between two sleepers comes a spirit all in white
5624952 who are these professionals who demolished the buildings and who paid them
5624953 i was a high class muscleman for big business for wall street and for the bankers
5624954 in short i was a racketeer a gangster for capitalism
5624955 but plenty of elderly chinese women have taken his place the more daring cart trains move along in traffic right on the double yellow traffic divider lines theyve established this unique right of way without waiting for a local law like the bicycle lanes have
5624956 now obviously something had really affected him deeply but at that time there just werent the kinds of facilities to help somebody work through that kind of pain
5624957 thats why this idea of making sure that every single veteran when they are discharged are screened for post traumatic stress disorder and given the mental health services that they need thats why its so important
5624958 barack obama owes the american public an explanation in light of his statement yesterday regarding his uncle and the liberation of auschwitz it is a well known fact that soviet troops liberated auschwitz unless obamas uncle served in the red army his statement looks nothing short of fatuous and americans expect something better than exaggerations and outright distortions from a candidate who hopes to become our next commander in chief
5624959 its not surprising then that they get bitter they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like them or anti immigrant sentiment or anti trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations
5624960 religious suffering is at the same time an expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature the sentiment of a heartless world and the soul of a soulless condition it is the opium of the people
5624961 i was a constitutional law professor which means unlike the current president i actually respect the constitution obama told an audience at a campaign fundraiser
5624962 several direct mail pieces issued for obamas primary senate campaign said he was a law professor at the university of chicago he is not he is a senior lecturer now on leave at the school in academia there is a vast difference between the two titles details matter
5624963 because some folks were willing to march across a bridge so they got together and barack obama jr was born so dont tell me i dont have a claim on selma alabama
5624964 earlier in the day at a prayer breakfast the illinois democrat said if it hadnt been for selma i wouldnt be here
5624965 barack obama was born in hawaii on august 4th 1961
5624966 obama has claimed on numerous occasions to have become fluent in indonesian in six months yet those who knew him disputed that during recent interviews israella pareira darmawan obamas 1st grade teacher said she attempted to help him learn the indonesian language by going over pronunciation and vowel sounds he struggled greatly with the foreign language she said and with his studies as a result
5624967 obama said at some point in fall 2005 he got a stockholder letter he said he believes it was from avi or skyterra but he couldnt remember which company
5624968 the origin of the shareholder update obama referred to remains unclear skyterra like many public companies sends investors copies of its securities and exchange commission sec proxy forms also known as 14as but none were issued during the fall of 2005 according to sec records
5624969 it doesnt sound like anything we would have sent out
5624970 avi generally sends mailings to shareholders or institutional investors that proactively request them or sign up for e mail lists said michael hubbard avis investor relations director it doesnt sound like anything we would have sent out hubbard said
5624971 thursday obama said of de vellis that his campaign had no way of knowing who this person was if i have a phone contract with verizon and an employee of a phone company does something that you know were not responsible for that obama said
5624972 obamas campaign says it had no role in creating or posting the ad but wednesday democratic operative philip de vellis took credit for the ad it turned out that he worked for blue state digital a computer firm that is among obamas consultants
5624973 blue state helped design obamas web site and one of the firms founding members joe rospars took a leave from the company to work as obamas director of new media
5624974 on thursday an earlier e mail surfaced in which de vellis boasted to numerous people about his role in the creation of a web page my barackobama com a site designed by blue state digital
5624975 the press secretary for sen barack obama d ill recently lived with the creator of the scathingly satirical youtube video ad that attacked sen hillary clinton d n y a revelation that seems to undermine the senators claim that he and his campaign had only very attenuated ties with the ads creator
5624976 but its not something that we had anything to do with or were aware of and that frankly given what it looks like we dont have the technical capacity to create something like that
5624977 i made the ad on a sunday afternoon in my apartment using my personal equipment a mac and some software uploaded it to youtube and sent links around to blogs
5624978 according to the obama campaign obamas punahou classmate keith kakugawa explicitly raised the possibility that he could make up false stories about obama implying he would do so if the campaign did not give him money
5624979 that allegation infuriated kakugawa prompting him to speak to the tribune after repeatedly refusing to do so
5624980 kakugawa wouldnt discuss his school days with obama other than to say he considered the senator a brother and wouldnt do a damn thing to ever hurt his campaign
5624981 unfairly omits others responsible for the successes of the asbestos campaign
5624982 and though most memoirs place their authors at the center of events critics of dreams from my father say the book unfairly omits others responsible for the successes of the asbestos campaign an event that obama portrays as central to his maturation as a political leader
5624983 obama did not play the singular role in the asbestos episode
5624984 they say obama did not play the singular role in the asbestos episode that he portrays in the best selling memoir dreams from my father a story of race and inheritance credit for pushing officials to deal with the cancer causing substance according to interviews and news accounts from that period also goes to a well known preexisting group at altgeld gardens and to a local newspaper called the chicago reporter obama does not mention either one in his book
5624985 in his best selling autobiography dreams from my father obama describes having heated conversations about racism with another black student ray the real ray keith kakugawa said he does recall long soulful talks with the young obama and that his friend confided his longing and loneliness but those talks kakugawa said were not about race not even close
5624986 the handful of black students who attended punahou school in hawaii for instance say they struggled mightily with issues of race and racism there but absent from those discussions they say was another student then known as barry obama
5624987 then theres the copy of life magazine that obama presents as his racial awakening at age 9 in it he wrote was an article and two accompanying photographs of an african american man physically and mentally scarred by his efforts to lighten his skin in fact the life article and the photographs dont exist say the magazines own historians
5624988 when asked about the discrepancy obama said in a recent interview it might have been an ebony or it might have been
5624989 this is a machine city and ward leaders have to pay their committee people
5624990 barack obamas campaign doesnt pay workers and i guarantee you if they dont put up some money for those street workers those leaders will most likely take clinton money it wont stop him from winning philadelphia but he wont come out with the numbers that he needs
5624991 they view it that the white people are getting all the money for tv
5624992 and theyre the ones who are the foot soldiers on the street theyre predominantly african americans and theyre not the ones who are getting that tv money
5624993 hardscrabble neighborhoods across the city have come to depend on street money as a welcome payday for knocking on doors handing out leaflets and speaking to voters as they arrive at polling places
5624994 most of the ward leaders we live in a very poor area and people look forward to election days
5624995 paulmier said that of his wards 48 committee people the vast majority supported obama
5624996 you dont come to someones house and change the rules of someones house thats just respect
5624997 men are like pumpkins it seems like all the good ones are taken or theyve had everything scraped out of their heads with a spoon
5624998 it is not in the stars to hold our destiny but in ourselves
5624999 if i had a world of my own everything would be nonsense nothing would be what it is because everything would be what it isnt and contrary wise what is it wouldnt be and what it wouldnt be it would you see

5625004 missile defense washington and poland just moved the world closer to war
5625005 the signing now insures an escalation of tensions between russia and nato and a new cold war arms race in full force it is important for readers to understand the ability of one of two opposing sides to put anti missile missiles to within 90 miles of the territory of the other in even a primitive first generation anti missile missile array gives that side virtual victory in a nuclear balance of power and forces the other to consider unconditional surrender or to pre emptively react by launching its nuclear strike before 2012
5625006 us troops on monday july 14 began military exercises near the russian border in ex soviet ukraine and were poised to launch them in georgia amid tense relations between moscow and washington a ceremony inaugurating the sea breeze 2008 nato exercise was held off ukraines black sea coast against anti nato protests and a hostile reaction from officials in russia sea breeze 2008 includes forces from armenia azerbaijan belgium britain canada denmark france georgia germany greece latvia macedonia and turkey the us georgia joint exercises will be held at the vaziani military base less than 100 kilometers 60 miles from the russian border with a total of 1 650 servicemen taking part
5625007 this is a formula for an injection of us military and naval forces into georgia of indeterminate scope and duration it will certainly involve the presence of hundreds if not thousands of uniformed us military personnel on the ground and a substantial number of warships in the region the us is introducing this military force into a situation that remains highly unstable and combustible raising the possibility of a direct military clash between the united states and russia

5625016 each chapter of this volume records an effort of mine to question the nature of some certainty each therefore deals with deception the deception embodied in one of our institutions institutions create certainties and taken seriously certainties deaden the heart and shackle the imagination it is always my hope that my statements angry or passionate artful or innocent will also provide a smile and thus a new freedom even though the freedom come at a cost
5625017 the modern university confers the privilege of dissent on those who have been tested and classified as potential money makers or power holders no one is given tax funds for the leisure in which to educate himself or the right to educate others unless at the same time he can also be certified for achievement schools select for each successive level those who have at earlier stages in the game proved themselves good risks for the established order having a monopoly on both the resources for learning and the investiture of social roles the university coopts the discoverer and the potential dissenter a degree always leaves its indelible price tag on the curriculum of its consumer certified college graduates fit only into a world which puts a price tag on their heads thereby giving them the power to define the level of expectations in their society in each country the amount of consumption by the college graduate sets the standard for all others if they would be civilized people on or off the job they will aspire to the style of life of college graduates
5625018 in a consumer society there are inevitably two kinds of slaves the prisoners of addiction and the prisoners of envy man must choose whether to be rich in things or in the freedom to use them

5625028 basically whoever can throw the ball best i suppose especially in the front row with hookers and props especially the ability to lift in the lineout has to be about as good as each other
5625029 realistically if one of the props can throw the ball in then why not consistency is a big thing with line out throwing making sure you can hit that target or get close enough to it 99 per cent of the time or as close as you can to 100 from a generic point of view anyone in the line out especially the front row can throw
5625030 he knows how he performed we just have to make sure he works hard to get the problem fixed its a combination of factors as well if one small thing is out in lifting throwing the movement of the lineout or the guy going up
5625031 there are several factors that we have to cover to make sure the throw hits the spot he just needs to understand what sort of throw needs to go where and work well with the lifters and jumpers

5625066 kraft ebbing records the case of a neurasthenic russian aged 24 who experienced
5625067 i hold the prime minister personally responsible for the damage that is about to be done to the nation and to the integrity and dignity of the malays
5625068 and on the seventh day god ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made and god blessed the seventh day and sanctified it
5625069 remember the sabbath day to keep it holy six days shalt thou labour and do all thy work but the seventh day is the sabbath of the lord thy god in it thou shalt not do any work for in six days the lord made heaven and earth the sea and all that in them is and rested the seventh day wherefore the lord blessed the sabbath day
5625070 six days may work be done but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest holy to the lord whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day he shall surely be put to death wherefore the children of israel shall keep the sabbath to observe the sabbath throughout their generations for a perpetual covenant
5625071 but pray ye that your flight be not in winter neither on the sabbath day
5625072 therefore the son of man is lord also of the sabbath
5625073 no other day is called the sabbath in old or new testaments
5625074 i didnt get even one response claiming the 1 million from any theologian bishop cardinal pope or anyone else
5625075 why not because they cant observing sunday as the sabbath is the biggest hoax the world has ever seen
5625076 from todays christian point of view the sabbath is sunday
5625077 as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and stood up to read
5625078 in the weekly reckoning of time sunday recalls the day of christs resurrection
5625079 so that shoots in the foot the belief that he was raised on sunday
5625080 i personally believe he was crucified on wednesday evening and rose after 6 p m saturday evening
5625081 the jews therefore because it was the preparation that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day for that sabbath day was an high day
5625082 for as jonah was in the belly of the great fish for three days and three nights so i the son of man will be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights
5625083 the new testament evidence is not conclusive and nowhere ordains or instructs sunday keeping
5625084 calls on the corinthians to treasure up on the first day of the week
5625085 he does not explicitly say there whether the envisioned context is a gathering of the assembly or if this refers to what people do in their own homes
5625086 and upon the first day of the week when the disciples came together to break bread paul preached unto them
5625087 this text appears to show a particular sunday eucharistic gathering but it does not tell us if this replaced the sabbath observance or stood alongside it i e people observed both
5625088 and on one of the sabbaths having been assembled us to break bread paul was lecturing them
5625089 its talking about the day of the lord mentioned in the old testament its prophecy about when christ comes back the book of revelation reveals the events of the day of the lord it has nothing to do with a worship day
5625090 john probably means that his visionary experience happened during the time when other christians were gathered for worship
5625091 the other interpretation equating it with the day of the lord doesnt really make sense because the earlier parts of the vision are not placed temporally at the end of history that is only approached over several chapters into revelation
5625092 the practice of christians gathering together for worship on sunday dates back to apostolic times but details of the actual development of the custom are not clear
5625093 if the new testament had intended for us to start worshipping on the first day of the week then wed find ample evidence for it yet its not in there
5625094 and when the jews were gone out of the synagogue the gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath and the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of god
5625095 from sabbath to sunday a historical investigation of the rise of sunday observance in early christianity
5625096 the church of the capital of the empire whose authority was already felt far and wide in the second century appears to be the most likely birthplace of sunday observance
5625097 you may read the bible from genesis to revelation and you will not find a single line authorizing the sanctification of sunday the scriptures enforce the religious observance of saturday a day which we never sanctify
5625098 anti judaism caused the abandonment of the sabbath and pagan sun worship influenced the adoption of sunday
5625099 witnessed and participated in the process of separation from judaism which led the majority of the christians to abandon the sabbath and adopt sunday as the new day of worship
5625100 the adoption of the 25th of december for the celebration of christmas is perhaps the most explicit example of sun worships influence on the christian liturgical calendar
5625101 it is a known fact that the pagan feast of the dies natalis solis invicti the birthday of the invincible sun was held on that date
5625102 the best way to convert pagans was to not have them change too much just accept their pagan holidays as long as they accepted jesus as messiah they didnt really have to do much more than that
5625103 on the venerable day of the sun let the magistrates and people residing in cities rest and let all workshops be closed
5625104 the importance of the actions of constantine cannot be overstated
5625105 during his reign pagan sun worship was blended with the worship of the creator and officially entitled christianity
5625106 christians must not judaize by resting on the sabbath but must work on that day rather honoring the lords day sunday and if they can resting then as christians but if any shall be found to be judaizers let them be anathema from christ
5625107 lists of arrests and fines for walking and travelling unnecessarily on the sabbath
5625108 it was jesus regular custom to worship on the sabbath and since that time and centuries before the jewish community has very carefully documented their observance of the seventh day sabbath saturday in other words history demonstrates that time has not been lost that the seven day cycle has been accurately recorded to this day
5625109 do you realize that this deception is blinding millions of people from knowing god
5625110 of all the new testament lists of sins breaking the sabbath is never mentioned
5625111 that is because it was given to the jews not the non jews
5625112 paul is very clear that we christians dont use one particular day as a determining factor if someone is right with god
5625113 there were four palestinians who were issued visas about whom we then received additional information

5625120 the ultimate test of a relationship is to disagree and to hold hands at the same time
5625121 in the 19 th century the prevalent view was that the world is deterministic and by looking at it today you can tell how it will look tomorrow
5625122 today most scientists think of the world as a collection of random processes interacting with each other as a mathematician part of my job is to understand these processes learn the laws and develop a language other sciences can use
5625123 i know anyway i got this cool playstation game that i want to play like now

5625128 building a relationship with someone who has dementia requires ongoing work and patience
5625129 you need to tailor communication strategies to peoples abilities not their disabilities you dont want to oversimplify and talk down to the person but you want to be understood as well
5625130 lultima volta che mi capitato di comprare un libro solo per la copertina poco tempo fa a dire il vero anche se il libro uscito lanno scorso non me ne sono affatto pentita a dispetto del titolo che pure mi ha conquistata appena lho letto su uno scaffale della libreria

5625133 as for an actual heavy communications tool for me i think those days may be behind me as well
5625134 any large ad network like overture federated media or aol would jump at the chance to get their pool of advertisers in front of this eternally patient gullible audience
5625135 mr spurgeon understood the importance of faith toward god it seems to me he had a gift of faith i cant read his writings without experiencing a transfer of faith to my soul spurgeon wrote the following about gods promises which we are to rehearse before him
5625136 come now let us reason together saith the lord though your sins be red like crimson they shall be as wool
5625137 this is a precious promise i wonder if it be true
5625138 lord here is the promise do as thou has said
5625139 lord i have nothing to recommend me but this thou hast said it
5625140 oh this is interesting someguyiveneverheardof com is reporting presumptive democratic nominee barack obama has lady parts obviously scurrilous and unfounded well examine it tonight in our special barack obamas vagina the october surprise in his pants
5625141 its the only way to find out whats really going on
5625142 hopefully the process is to spot things that would be grist for the funny mill
5625143 in some respects the heavier subjects are the ones that are most loaded with opportunity because they have the most potential energy so to delve into that gives you the largest combustion the most interest i dont mean for the audience i mean for us
5625144 would be very unpleasant for most people to watch its really a gathering of curmudgeons expressing frustration and upset and the rest of the day is spent trying to repress that through whatever creative devices we can find
5625145 they have used fringe scientists and fake experts to muddy scientific debates on global warming stem cell research evolution and other matters

5625148 the last remaining true dictatorship in the heart of europe
5625149 dr thaksin shinawatra to help communicate his vision and aspirations for the club
5625150 my experience is exactly the opposite and id rather make a judgment based on my experience than some theoretical hypothesis my job is that i run a commercial organisation so i dont deliberately do things that are bad for it commercially i might make a judgment error but so far we are the number one in the uk so we must be doing something right
5625151 listen im an agent not a principal if people think someone is a dictator then thats his problem and not mine i believe that everybody is entitled to their advocate i would never ask anybody here to do something which they were morally or ethically opposed to when we did a job for the norwegian government on whaling a number of people didnt want to work on it and i said they didnt have to
5625152 or try not to would probably be a more honest way of putting it
5625153 because im clearly a conservative and take the conservative whip in the house of lords everybody assumes that i run my business on the basis of being a conservative which is absolute rubbish
5625154 there are people here who represent the labour party the liberal democrats the green party
5625155 i do travel a lot i probably go more to the middle east than anywhere else i go to washington a lot and to various places in eastern europe and the occasional trip to south america
5625156 sky really began that process what sky did was introduce the concept of consumer empowerment
5625157 i would find it very hard to give good advice
5625158 she is a symbol of the hatred of the left
5625159 no because im older but i love my job and it has got better not worse i think ive got better at it because ive got more experience and because its more interesting now dealing with the mobile phone and the internet is a really interesting challenge and has had a real structural effect on our industry
5625160 i have to embrace digital technology because it would be stupid for me not to its not easy because im old and all the faces in the digital world are young but theres an inbuilt assumption that people who are young use the internet and people that are old dont its not true
5625161 our experience is that whatever the turbulence in the stock market whatever is being said about gloom and doom in the economy its not showing up in our figures
5625162 although people are having difficulties over credit and so on they are still using communications to talk to people about it whereas in the last downturn they said its a nightmare im not going to say a thing until its over
5625163 unfortunately a large number of people in our industry are not in it because they want a career and they want to understand how it works they just want a job they want to work for the least number of hours for the most amount of money our industry is populated by a lot of people who really arent very interested in what they do
5625164 on the other hand our role has become more important and people at the top of the business are contributing a hell of a lot more than they used to theyre invited to the top table because the discussion about how you are going to communicate something is almost as important as what youre going to communicate
5625165 the people i least enjoy working with are the people who really do take themselves seriously it makes relationships so difficult
5625166 im a great subscriber to winston churchills saying that the only original remark is something that hasnt been said for some time
5625167 marshall mcluhans great theory that its the medium not the message is actually not true
5625168 that included all those people who pronounce it oh ny an
5625169 i am still preparing my campaigning materials like flags and banners my opponents can have their big campaign we can have our slow campaign
5625170 es waren kl tzchebildung zu sehen bei langsam gespielten p ssen die spieler waren manchmal kaum zu erkennen
5625171 hes from texas so hes got to represent where hes from
5625172 we hadnt injected any new people in there in some time
5625173 i think it would have been a distraction going to the texans
5625174 my family is there a lot of my friends are right around the corner home is right around the corner coming out of high school thats why i went to iowa i kind of wanted to get away from all that so i could stay focused
5625175 coming to carolina its a great place and im happy to be here
5625176 hes making tremendous strides hes come and grasped this scheme like no other
5625177 if you look at him back there and you listen to him make his checks hes so confident you just have a lot of confidence in him as a linebacker taking the call from him hes been putting the work in and he knows what hes doing
5625178 i had to slow down because i was used to going up against these fast receivers
5625179 now im on tight ends where i have to slow down because i have more speeds than those guys so i can be there to make a play on the ball
5625180 a couple of possessions before that he was on the bench and he looked a little dizzy
5625181 probably the biggest moment ive had since ive been at iowa being called in the fourth quarter of a close game
5625182 coach ferentz called my name and said something like youre going in i got in and there i was
5625183 at the time the injuries it was like we couldnt catch a break
5625184 but now were in a new season a new team that will help a lot we dont have anyone out there that hasnt played before that makes a world of difference
5625185 the game slows down so much more when youve been out there
5625186 i need to step up to a leadership role be more of a vocal leader
5625187 ive been out there for a year if i say something people tend to listen more than some sophomore kid
5625188 weve got a good group of guys pretty young and pretty versatile
5625189 we have to sift through the whole stack there to find out whos who and where they belong
5625190 hes an extremely intelligent guy and he works at it theres not a reason why he cant have the success a chad greenway had and im not comparing him to greenway
5625191 if you take tarp at this state of his career and greenway at this stage they are comparable
5625192 his enthusiasm and the way hell run to the ball he likes to play football
5625193 he has a knack for finding the ball and getting to the ball some guys dont
5625194 bob sanders when he was young made a million mistakes but when he made them he was going a hundred miles per hour and jacody is kind of the same thing if youre going to make a mistake make it going fast
5625195 like most young linebackers he was better against the run he has to learn the pass
5625196 when i published my work it would take a couple years to circulate the academic community and public now with the internet i can write and publish instantly casual readers and researchers alike can review my work as i write it
5625197 i first read it online and was turned on that i went out and bought the book now im a true fan of las vegas nevada politics studies and research i find the subject to be extremely interesting and thought provoking and reminiscent of the free thought era in the late 60s and early 70s
5625198 the highest usage areas in our library now are the public computers with internet access although most of the time the crowd is younger and usually communicating with friends some older notable las vegas nevada politics researchers will come in and go straight for internet completely ignoring the card catalog
5625199 im happy to see that young people are interested in our las vegas nevada politics studies
5625200 the internet has piqued the interest of our youth and has given them unparalled access to all knowledge academic and secular
5625201 i like the internet because it is very transparent and available to all
5625202 but at the same time there is no authoritave body that can assign some sort of approval rating to truly legitimate works and those spun by unqualified authors
5625203 without the awesome las vegas nevada politics studies of heredia orum this area would never have reached popular society now we can truly dig out the truths and realities of the las vegas nevada politics world around us and develop more reliable and sound conclusions thousands of heads are better than a few
5625204 the thoughts of many of the old timers are shattered in the new las vegas nevada politics work released by prof kori damann and it is high time for new ideas
5625205 anaerobic digestion is extremely attractive why would we go on throwing food waste into holes in the ground when we could generate our own electricity and end up with a product that can be returned to the soil
5625206 i would gladly give everything i have not to be here
5625207 i dont want any family to feel what my wife and i feel
5625208 i want them to fix whats wrong with those 15 miles of the highway

5625282 the important thing is to get her back as soon as possible and get this treated

5625330 there is strong support for prices to drift lower towards 100 a barrel we are only about 10 a barrel away and i wont be surprised to see 105 a barrel by next month
5625331 the hurricane season is still a major issue as seen in 2005 with katrina we have to be mindful of that
5625332 nobody seems to be paying too much attention to that crude prices will drift lower at a slow and leisurely pace

5625338 russia needs to live up to the commitments that president dmitry medvedev has made we are absolutely clear that force cannot be the basis for demarcation of new lines around russia
5625339 i am not one that believes that isolating russia is the right answer to its misdemeanors i think the right response is hard headed engagement
5625340 we should signal that the agreement that was agreed upon should be fulfilled and russian troops should withdraw
5625341 we dont want to be in a situation where we are in some kind of frozen relationship
5625342 but until russia pulls its forces out of georgia and respects international norms of the 21st century we just cant go on with business as usual

5625344 hemos copiado a la naturaleza tomando los elementos y mecanismos hallados en la vida de las plantas que han evolucionado a lo largo de 3000 millones de a os y los hemos recreado en el laboratorio
5625345 un c mulo de manganeso es clave para la capacidad de la planta de usar agua di xido de carbono y luz solar para generar carbohidratos y ox geno la copia humana de este c mulo se desarroll por el profesor charles dismukes hace alg n tiempo y nosotros hemos dado un paso m s aprovechando la capacidad de estas mol culas para convertir agua en sus componentes elementales ox geno e hidr geno
5625346 el avance lleg cuando recubrimos un conductor de protones llamado nafion sobre un nodo para formar una membrana de pol meros de s lo unos micr metros de grosor el cual act a como anfitri n para los c mulos de manganeso
5625347 normalmente insoluble en agua cuando unimos el catalizador en los poros de la membrana de nafion se estabiliz contra la descomposici n y lo m s importante el agua pod a llegar al catalizador donde se oxidaba con la exposici n a la luz
5625348 aunque el hombre ha sido capaz de dividir el agua en hidr geno y ox geno desde hace a os nosotros hemos sido capaces de hacer lo mismo por primera vez usando s lo luz solar un potencial el ctrico de 1 2 voltios y la propia qu mica que la naturaleza ha seleccionado para este prop sito
5625349 tenemos que seguir aprendiendo de la naturaleza de tal forma que podamos llegar a dominar este proceso

5625352 we want to try and declutter that area and create a public plaza
5625353 its already a great place for people to meet and were going to remove traffic and create a much more pedestrian zone with more and better street furniture
5625354 well move the bike stands to create space and well have to figure out where to put the horse and carts taxis and bikes
5625355 its a fantastic opportunity and it could be extended to college green and westmoreland street because were digging that up as well its a great opportunity to create a pedestrian spine through the heart of the city
5625356 st stephens green cant go back exactly as it was there will be some vents on the island but theyll be disguised
5625357 a lot of the trees in place need a lot of root space and were working with the office of public works to see what species can go back in we think 44 or 45 mature trees will have to be removed
5625358 theres radar mapping now which tells us exactly whats underground
5625359 well need quite a lot of land but weve tried to ensure were under public roads and land traffic management will have an impact on the city and it disruption will be more than luas drumcondra all present big problems abbey street to the quays will have to be dug up and some side streets will be closed off in drumcondra the 2014 deadline is a big call its very complex but were taking an optimistic view some things are out of our hands and planning could take longer than expected

5625368 you have to weigh state secrets versus someones right to a fair trial when theyre facing the rest of their life in prison
5625369 were cutting the growth in the budget and if its that hard to cut the growth in the budget you can see how we got to this point
5625370 we wish the governor would be a little more aggressive on his bill on his proposal than hes been in trying to push the assembly to do it

5625380 to strangle somebody to death takes time takes pressure takes intent
5625381 whether it was self defense or not a jury has determined it was not
5625382 made it clear that the city could adopt forward looking changes to enhance safety and encouraged the city to take such steps
5625383 i dont believe anybody deliberately did anything to make that building less safe

5625400 may god protect pakistan may god protect you all long live pakistan forever
5625401 any political transition in pakistan will have no effect on pakistans nuclear assets because it has a very strong custodial control
5625402 president bush looks forward to working with the government of pakistan on the economic political and security challenges they face
5625403 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
5625404 do you know who you are f ing with we are the police
5625405 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition whats less apparent is the judgment to be commander in chief
5625406 if bobby bright is attempting to be a clean cut conservative candidate with christian values his association with a liberal unethical person like charlie rangel is going to hurt him
5625407 if i had to guess your average district 2 voter has no idea who charlie rangel is
5625408 dan seals is so desperate to be a congressman hell take money from anyone even an ethically challenged congressman from new york who gets thousands of dollars in free rent each month

5625419 just prior to the attack on moore bertuzzi had been on a shift to kill a penalty had missed the shift change and had remained on the ice for longer than the rest of his line
5625420 after being directed to get off the ice bertuzzi was on his way back to the bench when suddenly and without warning he turned around and skated back in the direction of moore and attacked moore this was not done under any specific or general direction or encouragement from crawford was a direct disobedience of the instruction that bertuzzi had been given from the bench to get off the ice and was a violation of bertuzzis duties which crawford could not be expected to have reasonably anticipated let alone control
5625421 crawford knew or ought to have known that this was likely to result in injury to moore
5625422 crawford denies having provided any instructions to bertuzzi that could reasonably have been interpreted by bertuzzi in a manner that would have resulted in the attack that he ultimately made on moore
5625423 had been relatively lethargic and complacent throughout the game prior to the attack and was not behaving in a manner that should have caused crawford to be reasonably concerned that he might engage in criminal behaviour
5625424 bertuzzis actions were entirely his own and totally unanticipated by crawford
5625425 what we wanted to do was bring it forward to the other two leagues we havent taken a position we just want to see what the whole environment is in terms of the use of import players
5625426 i think it was a great idea but right now were in a different situation
5625427 in the old days players wanted to come over to play now once their european clubs realize that these players weve drafted are on their team they want to keep them or sell them to the highest bidder
5625428 you think youre setting your team up but you find out you cant get his release
5625429 this is for sure something weve been facing for the last couple of years that european teams want to keep their players in their country
5625430 at the beginning our teams were very happy about the european draft and the quality of the players
5625431 but for a couple of years its been getting tougher and tougher to bring those players over and when they do come the quality of those players is not the same
5625432 we strongly advocate cutting out europeans from major junior in canada altogether or at least reduce the euro quota to one
5625433 we understand that the chl has totally different reasons than us for initiating this discussion
5625434 show me how much of an asshole you can be
5625435 this is the first of many it was always intended that there would be a lot more
5625436 its now or never if we cant qualify for the world cup now then were never going to get it done
5625437 but by the end of the session the ball was buzzing around
5625438 obviously toronto has a massive jamaican population we just hope that canadian fans are the louder of the bunch
5625439 as soon as i start wandering a little bit its like opening up a door and im just not paying attention to what im doing
5625440 even if you are on medication there are times where you come out of it just not pay attention to certain things
5625441 most people have lapses during games for me because of the way i am its a little bit harder to stay focused
5625442 i dont know if it was fair of us to do it to him
5625443 hes basically been told by j p and the organization almost like we did with dustin mcgowan two years ago if you end up losing 11 of your 14 starts youve got in the big leagues well so be it but youre here to stay
5625444 theyve got great arms and theyve got good stuff you have to try and corral em
5625445 has been on and off its basically been a pitch i havent thrown at all
5625446 sometimes i do a better job of reminding myself of them sometimes i let my emotions get the better of me

5625451 we are reviewing our shareholding in virgin nigeria at the moment we are in discussions with potential purchasers those talks are ongoing and have been in progress for several weeks
5625452 weve always said since it launched that its important that virgin nigeria goes its own way and is wholly owned by nigerian investors now its been just over three years so its appropriate to have those talks now weve helped it to become a safe and reliable flag carrier for the region
5625453 it is appropriate to consider whether the virgin brand should remain linked to virgin nigeria removing the virgin branding is a possible future option
5625454 theres no doubt that lots of recent events have helped our view
5625455 as far as virgin is concerned we signed a detailed contract in 2004 providing all the necessary documents a deal is a deal so virgin nigeria should be allowed to operate domestic flights out of the international terminal
5625456 try to unblur your face youre moving in six different directions at the same time

5625460 it is expected to be a budget that is probably aimed at accommodating the needs of the lower class such as those in need of assistance
5625461 for instance a social safety net the government will try to ensure continued consumption and spending in the economy
5625462 we have done that before which will give more disposal income
5625463 if i earn an extra rm10 000 my personal income tax band changes i need to pay a little extra tax unlike in countries like singapore where you tend to move slow from one band to the other or a higher band
5625464 we keep on proposing implementation of the gst but the timing is bad now nevertheless we are supportive of a gst so long it is implemented effectively
5625465 continuing worries about a u s economy slowdown which may spread to the euro zone and perhaps also asia are weighing down on oil pricing
5625466 in the near term there will be a lot of downward pressure but i dont foresee a fast collapse of pricing to 100 dollars a barrel or below there is still strong support at 110 a barrel level because of supply side issues
5625467 londoners need to know who is actually running their city is it boris johnson who yesterday did not know that one of his deputies has been making major planning decisions on his behalf or is it his coterie of unelected appointees
5625468 i look forward to advising boris on an ongoing basis on transport i have concluded however that it would not be appropriate for an unelected official to chair a body which is responsible for most of the money and a large part of the brief of an elected mayor i also agree with the mayor that my position as adviser does not justify my full time and exclusive commitment to the greater london authority or the title of first deputy mayor we have therefore decided to adjust the management structure and abolish that position
5625469 was delighted when tim parker agreed to take charge of the board on my behalf over the last few weeks however it has become increasingly apparent to both of us that the nature of the decisions that need to be take are highly political and there is no substitute for me as the directly elected mayor being in charge there are limits therefore to what can be delegated
5625470 to lose one advisor is unfortunate to lose two is careless but to lose three in four months shows the wheels are coming off this new administration

5625484 tip 1 is a no brainer unless you are dr who
5625485 tip 6 just because the comment is negative doesnt mean it should be ignored it may in fact contain much more valuable information than a whole pile of positive comments
5625486 tip 9 although not quite in the way rajaie talks about
5625487 tip 10 you may be able to relate better to the negative comment by putting yourself in the commentors shoes
5625488 but you could always make a poll asking your readers for their opinion on the article to improve it for next time
5625489 writing a post discussing how you deal with negative comments

5625506 my hands slipped a couple times and i guess they saw me
5625507 and they didnt see that one i had a big target on my back
5625508 cullinan was one of the teams favorite people socially and always had a great perspective on things
5625509 her energy wit and spunk gave her the ability to find humor in any situation
5625510 she never failed to reach out to other sisters exhibiting an ingrained sense of kindness and genuineness our hearts and condolences go out to her family she will always be remembered within our sisterhood as one of our kindest and most loyal sisters and we feel a deep sadness at her loss
5625511 she was crazy in a really good way and really friendly
5625512 she could make friends with anyone she was really really a wonderful person
5625513 theyre having a very tough time right now as you can imagine
5625514 any student who feels the need to speak to a counselor psychiatrist or psychologist should certainly seek out help at dicks house

5625519 it takes time but i think he did good out there
5625520 today was a big step for him he did a good job i was impressed with his instincts when we switched off a couple things hopefully come game time hell be 100 percent
5625521 everyone kind of knew i didnt warm up properly i talked to trainers about it its something were going to be doing pregame especially for late games with the monday night games we have i need a routine to get up in the mornings and get going
5625522 it feels good but there definitely is some weakness in there im trying to get the strength and range of motion back a bit but its healing pretty good
5625523 it hurts a little bit just in evaluating the young players giving them game experience and opportunity and then seeing them over the long haul of things
5625524 the combination of brain imaging and genetics research has exciting potential to reveal the genes that are important in the development of brain disorders

5625527 what mark accomplished was amazing and it can never be taken away
5625528 its amazing that at the time i came back with three medals and it was such an accomplishment
5625529 i had three of the five medals the whole team won and 40 years later thats been tied but not broken still a record and i had to reframe things reframe the attitude
5625530 the olympic games are so different they are totally different from other competitions even the world championships he knew that from his own experiences
5625531 my parents bought b amp b sports and asked if id like to help do it all together as a family it was the largest sporting good store north of the lower mainland and we had everything i have very good memories of prince george
5625532 i took the loss personally and i identified myself as a loser
5625533 from my standpoint if i wasnt being measured or observed i wasnt real
5625534 how many people get to go to the olympic games how many go there favoured as i was
5625535 in 1968 we didnt have a lot of athletes there and we didnt have a very good track record really
5625536 i counsel now that athletes cant take it personally that it doesnt reflect them as a person it cant be your whole identity
5625537 caution this show may be a suffocation hazard because you cant poke holes in my arguments
5625538 there is some hard thinking that needs to be done
5625539 the fed has a terrific reputation as a credible institution we have to be cautious not to undertake things that put that credibility at risk
5625540 they want to placate the congress and the financial markets
5625541 how can you be independent on one score and dependent on another
5625542 are overburdening the federal reserve and that sets up the potential for multiple conflicts
5625543 they use up their credibility on nonmonetary issues they lose their independence and they dilute their expertise
5625544 it is much harder to say no when you have the precedent
5625545 congress needs to find a way to structure something else to take the fed out of this
5625546 they have had to abandon all principles that guided their earlier debates
5625547 but the truth is that the beneficiaries of our actions were not bear stearns and were not even principally wall street it was main street
5625548 the financial system has been under a lot of stress and that has affected our ability to grow its affected employment its affected credit availability
5625549 we are in a new environment and the fed had to do something different
5625550 attention should be paid to the risk that market participants might incorrectly view the fed as a source of unconditional support
5625551 is going to become a major regulator of financial institutions
5625552 that can come at a very big cost to innovation and the welfare of the country
5625553 i had no interest in holding other peoples babies i was afraid i would feel that way about my own
5625554 its pure emotion it bowls you over in the best way
5625555 hey were not trying to teach you anything were just saying get involved and dont worry
5625556 i can barely look after myself so how in the world are we going to look after another person
5625557 whats my life going to be like after the babys born and am i ever going to see my mates again
5625558 may i suggest if there are five blokes to every girl we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa
5625559 theres a lot of anger circulating among the community at the moment a lot of passionate anger
5625560 weve got a saying up here that the odds are good but the goods are odd
5625561 we couldnt open the windows because it was freezing rain
5625562 so i told the class tomorrow well have to remember to bring a fan
5625563 the student told us that if you are in a sealed room with an electric fan it will lower your body temperature and you will die
5625564 it was so weird to see someone so convinced of something that everyone else in the room thought was so ludicrous
5625565 it is something ive grown up knowing just like you dont go swimming until half an hour after youve eaten
5625566 dont point the fan straight at your face you never know you might die
5625567 its the most ridiculous thing but people dont sleep with fans in the room when i go to korea
5625568 from 2003 2005 a total of 20 cases were reported involving asphyxiations caused by leaving electric fans and air conditioners on while sleeping
5625569 ive heard that the death is not just because of the fan alone
5625570 the people who died had heart problems or they were drunk the actual cause of the death was low temperature and stuff
5625571 with asphyxiation you have a sealed room and you move the air around how will you suck the air out while its sealed an electric fan doesnt consume oxygen this is fuelled by electricity and you are just moving air around its impossible
5625572 it tends to be young people found dead in their rooms and they blame the fan
5625573 its just as likely that its a cultural cover for alcohol poisoning
5625574 traditional fairy legends or contemporary ufo abductions are used for things that are either inadmissible or untellable in present company
5625575 there have been plenty written about and used as a way to get around telling children the truth about some event well the fairies took her we dont have to say if someone left their spouse
5625576 the fact that fan death is well known in korea and can be used to postpone explanations or cover up the truth is very interesting and a very traditional way of going about things
5625577 each problem has hidden in it an opportunity so powerful that it literally dwarfs the problem the greatest success stories were created by people who recognized a problem a turned it into an opportunity
5625578 locarno has an excellent reputation in the tourist and cultural fields
5625579 and we are proud that a swiss airbus a320 will now carry its name to all of europes major airports
5625580 with its piazza grande and lake maggiore locarno offers the perfect setting for one of the worlds most important film festivals
5625581 good transport links are vital to our being able to stage such an event and a good number of our guests from all over the world come to switzerland by air from now on they may even get here on the locarno
5625582 we are the national airline of the whole of switzerland
5625583 and as our countrys ambassador we are proud to represent locarno and canton ticino this wonderful region in switzerlands south
5625584 hay muchos j venes solteros y fuertes en la villa y como en cualquier otro sitio algunos se enamoran y esas cosas as que hay que poner a su alcance los condones

5625587 these acquisitions reinforce our policy of operating a young fleet that provides more passenger comfort in our quest for tam service excellence
5625588 im asking the lord to help me preach a good sermon
5625589 so your mother says your prayers for you each night thats very commendable what does she say
5625590 i asked god to teach me to whistle and he just then did
5625591 and do you always say them in the morning too
5625592 kelli why do you always add the part about all girls
5625593 because we always finish our prayers by saying all men
5625594 but this is grandmas house and she knows how to cook
5625595 were all backslapping each other this has been months in the making
5625596 he comes in not immediately as the boss but he has an interesting genetic profile that in certain sort of medical contexts theyve noticed that many times serial killers have that same genetic profile
5625597 and this gentleman knows this about himself and is sort of in this journey to discover who his true character will ultimately become
5625598 let me just say that i have no knowledge of such biological profile nor would i be at liberty to speak about such a biological profile if such a biological profile did exist
5625599 its nothing as simple as he has the genes of a serial killer because theres no such thing
5625600 its a fascinating and incredibly intense process and i think laurence is going to get a lot out of it
5625601 the cw and our studio partner cbs paramount network television have made the strategic marketing decision not to screen 90210 for any media in advance of its premiere
5625602 my theory is if a character is specific enough and real enough people will embrace him whether the character is quote unquote likable or not
5625603 theres a lot of talk in hollywood about the likability of characters is the audience going to like him are they going to like him are they going to like him you hear this over and over
5625604 my own theory and its been borne out with dwight is that i dont give a flip if the audience likes me or not im just going to really inhabit this very strange character with very specific kind of quirks and if i do it right the audience will like how strongly the character registers i think thats happened with dwight they embrace how annoying he is
5625605 its a tricky analogy fish from the rocker was on the cusp of fame and had it snatched away from him and then found it 20 years later
5625606 me rainn wilson i was never on any cusp of fame i just started from the bottom the absolute bottom the swamp of acting and kind of crawled my way up fingernail by fingernail to get to the point where im having success beyond my wildest dreams in my early 40s which is pretty bizarre it doesnt happen often i think it happened to like me and house actor hugh laurie
5625607 i auditioned for six roles on that show i tried for the priest i auditioned for three members of the gay choir i didnt get any of them and i was crushed i loved that show and i really wanted to be on it
5625608 this was the heyday of hbo sex and the city the sopranos entourage curb your enthusiasm people were watching what was happening and there were a lot of stars being broken
5625609 the reason the show works so well isnt blind luck executive producer greg daniels spent months casting it and the call backs instead of one afternoon at nbc it was all weekend long with two 12 hour days
5625610 i was confident and excited about it from the beginning
5625611 plus it was such a new and fresh way of doing a workplace comedy in this country the documentary style and the awareness of the camera and the dynamics between the characters were so strong
5625612 if the rocker makes 100 million then ill get another shot if it makes 14 million then the road to playing a lead in a studio comedy is not going to be open to me for awhile you learn in acting that you cant control that you have to surrender a lot
5625613 people ask why i picked the rocker it was the only project open to me that had any traction i think people have this image of me at home with 15 great scripts on my desk and me stroking my chin and saying hmm which one should i choose
5625614 do we really need to see women playing volleyball in bikinis
5625615 would shorts and a t shirt really hinder their performance im convinced the real reason that womens olympic softball is going the way of the cassette player is because the players compete fully clothed and who picked the fabric for the u s womens gymnasts outfits yikes
5625616 i havent seen so much shiny spandex since a jazzercise class in 1989 just google shiny spandex and see what you get not olympic athletes
5625617 fresh picked new albums and tracks just off the vine
5625618 wide awake in the spirit world the best of outrageous cherry
5625619 the first thing that he will do when he returns home is to focus on his health since he is fairly old
5625620 it is considered too sexy for us its not good for viewers in malaysia
5625621 we dont want our people our teenagers influenced by their performance we want clean artists artists that are good role models
5625622 we love our vacuum weve found god and we gave at the office

5625624 in questo momento mi sento pienamente coinvolto in questa avventura musicale mi sembrato naturale forte del supporto avuto dai numerosi fan di ogni parte del mondo proseguire il filone artistico che ho sviluppato in tutti i miei precedenti lavori con lentusiasmo la disciplina e lenergia che mi hanno sempre caratterizzato
5625625 like a bird on the wire like a drunk in a midnight choir i have tried in my way to be free
5625626 all the time and effort and energy they spent all goes for naught and theyre going to have to start over if they are going to do anything or appeal
5625627 either way i think we are in a much much better position
5625628 any mechanism where this city can purge itself of wrongdoing
5625629 we have to abide by the order of the court well review with mr goodman all our options
5625630 i think thats the appropriate venue its been the appropriate venue all along
5625631 i think the youth from 12 to 18 are kind of lost they dont know their place in the tribe
5625632 what happened to the girls over at beaver creek sad to say it woke everybody up right its sad to say that it took their deaths to bring our tribe together as one
5625633 we need more parental supervision we need more guidance we need more activities out there that will keep kids involved
5625634 we need a recreation area around here where kids can play basketball
5625635 kids drop out of school and dont finish their education
5625636 i think my daughter tried a little too hard to try to fit in she was an impressionable age
5625637 that seems to be like a normal thing on the reservation like drugs and alcohol and she was exposed to it more and i dont know that she knew how to handle it
5625638 we have a long waiting list of people waiting to go to treatment
5625639 so we basically have the same life expectancy as somebody in africa
5625640 the volcanic origin of the island makes being there an emotional interior journey
5625641 when i first visited lanzarote i found the landscape profoundly disturbing i had never seen colours so dramatically dark and i so fond of brilliant clashing colours was fascinated by the subtle obscurity of the place black had never formed part of my palette
5625642 the authorities here are not doing this because they like films but because they like money we will film their streets their people and export the image of the canaries making films is the best way to make money
5625643 the canaries have suffered a downturn in property prices in keeping with the rest of spain but the presence of almod var in lanzarote has already created a stir in terms of the amount of enquiries we are getting for properties
5625644 these sorts of problems occur everywhere and we are going to take action over this but i must point out that the number of robberies on tourists has gone down
5625645 shareholders should only accept this dilution as a last resort
5625646 is going to heap further pressure on euro zone consumers who are struggling to keep up with rising costs just at the very time that speculation was starting to emerge as to how quickly the ecb could afford a rate cut itself aimed at stimulating growth

5625651 we should not reject any idea just because it is radical or controversial
5625652 we may be able to find an acceptable way to allow a meaningful compensation for some living unrelated kidney donors without breaching ethical principles or hurting the sensitivities of others
5625653 it is not a good idea to legalize payment for organ donors as such payment institutionalizes the belief that the wealthy ill have property rights to the body parts of the poor
5625654 if monetary incentive makes a potential living donor more willing to save another life what is wrong in allowing that
5625655 rich people have no reason to sell a kidney that is the flaw that is unacceptable in any scheme involving purchasing a kidney its exploitative
5625656 nu trebuie sa mi spui ce sa fac pentru ca tu nu esti tatal meu

5625660 you know unfortunately that the number of threats in the world has not become fewer we know at what cost victory was won these lessons should serve as lessons of courage and memory for all of our citizens
5625661 russia will stand up for the legal interests of our citizens in russia and beyond its borders
5625662 and we approve your decisive actions to stop the aggression by georgia
5625663 we do not want escalation in the international situation we simply want respect
5625664 ten days have passed since you came to face the perfidious georgian army you carried out the operation to enforce peace with exactitude you showed true heroism while aberrant politicians were showing how they can kill defenseless civilians
5625665 you fought honesty and effectively that is of great value we did not plan to respond to such an audacious caper in this situation but our peacekeepers with your participation were able to act in such a way as to show there good military training our armed forces overcame a crisis in the 1990s and are now combat ready and able to fulfill any peacekeeping operation and to defend the lives of our citizens
5625666 but i think our strong side is a fighting spirit
5625667 we will break them in spite of the surprise attack and the intensity and aggressiveness no one thought that georgia would fire on civilians and its own citizens thats an interesting way to unite a country
5625668 no one plans to withdraw the russian contingent too fast there is no need for it the entire operation was conducted successfully and lightning fast but we dont plan to leave the conflict zone so fast the withdrawal will be scheduled and gradual
5625669 but the georgians ran like you wont even see at the olympics
5625670 additional security measures i e the presence of russian forces can be applied only in direct proximity to south ossetia and not in any other part of georgia
5625671 to call an extraordinary meeting of the council to discuss the consequences of such a state of affairs
5625672 its kind of hard to imagine someone hitting someone and leaving their body on that hard blacktop in the middle of the night
5625673 just leaving him i cant imagine he was not deserving of that no one is
5625674 he was northbound on m 66 and it looks like a vehicle on m 78 may have pulled out in front of him
5625675 it looks like he may have laid the bike down but had contact with the other vehicle
5625676 thats someone who doesnt have a conscience its not a human being to do something like that
5625677 we think whoever was in the car would have known something occurred
5625678 these cases are tough to handle that time of night and no witnesses but we would hope that someone saw something even if it is something they feel is insignificant
5625679 he was shy but if you talked to him about history he just opened up
5625680 one time he went to a gas station and there was someone working on christmas and he gave them a 20 tip
5625681 we involved the community every step of the way so we feel very secure in the plan
5625682 its just that the michigan economy is so difficult right now were going to lay off for now and continue to educate the public about the plan
5625683 weve always had a problem getting the other side of the coin the other opinions
5625684 maybe theres a way to use the internet to help stimulate those people who have problems with the way things are going
5625685 he is in the top tier of athletics and now hes going to get his tryout as a personality
5625686 and tiger woods sure passed but mark spitz didnt and there are plenty of people who they try to develop the whole persona around and two years later its gone

5625785 cuando me lo vendieron no me dijeron que estaba prohibido
5625786 adem s de que es muy dif cil detectarlo porque el polic a lo nico que ve es una persona hablando al aire no entrar a en ninguno de los supuestos previstos por la ley

5625792 why should the nrm lose elections we are the ones who restored democracy in uganda who else should win in this country the president told a rally at apuuton primary school grounds katakwi on saturday last week museveni was on tour of eastern uganda where he took the opportunity to confirm albeit indirectly his intention to run for another term of the presidency in 2011 when he said that he is in good health and capable of running the government for several years to come the comments however drew criticism from opposition parties which believe that museveni could lose in the coming elections fdc spokesman wafula oguttu said on sunday that mr musevenis comments about the nrm ruling the country as long as it takes were inaccurate he will be surprised when he will be swept away and another person leads this country

5625795 they had details of explosives and poisons along with information about london landmarks and a computer folder on royal residences wed be foolish to rule out the fact that they may have been planning an attack
5625796 hij zette zich in voor alfabetisme en mensenrechten hij was er altijd en daarom zijn wij nu allemaal hier voor hem
5625797 the existence of earlier disputes between the parties is not evidence of malice
5625798 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
5625799 in cazul in care companiile si nu este vorba doar despre enel ci despre proprietarii unor monopoluri energetice in general vor continua aceasta politica care este in fond indreptata impotriva intereselor statului
5625800 es gibt solche gespr che aber es sind nur gespr che aber ich sage nicht dass keine tatsachen dahinter stehen
5625801 die kubaner haben lange auf uns gewartet meiner meinung nach warten sie auch heute auf uns sie werden wahrscheinlich keinen einwand erheben wenn wir wieder elektronische berwachungsanlagen auf dem st tzpunkt in lourdes errichten oder irgendetwas anderes tun
5625802 wenn wir diese nicht haben dann werden wir in die strategischen spiele der anderen hineingezogen denn der planet von heute ist in kraftfelder aufgeteilt in dem die interessen von l ndern blocks und koalitionen miteinander verflochten sind wir brauchen ein system eigener st tzpunkte im ausland eine solche pr senz bietet ein effektiveres und stabileres sicherheitssystem
5625803 die us regierung muss die russen ganz klar wissen lassen dass ein solcher schritt bedeuten w rde dass eine fest umrissene schwelle berschritten wird dass sie ber eine rote linie gehen
5625804 wir m ssen unsere stellung nicht nur in kuba sondern auch in anderen l ndern wiederherstellen
5625805 russland bestrebt ist ein multipolares system internationaler beziehungen zu schaffen
5625806 der westen sein monopol auf den prozess der globalisierung verloren hat
5625807 russland ist wirklich st rker geworden und in der lage eine wichtige verantwortung f r die l sung regionaler und globaler probleme zu bernehmen
5625808 alle versuche nationale oder gruppeninteressen auf kosten des internationalen rechts durchzusetzen zu erkennen und manchmal einfach zur ckzuweisen
5625809 ziele darauf ab dem westen umfassende garantien beiderseitiger sicherheit anzubieten
5625810 die bedrohungen im 21 jahrhundert richten sich sowohl gegen russland als auch gegen den westen
5625811 wenn es im westen menschen gibt die verstehen dass sie sich ohne russland nicht gegen diese bedrohungen verteidigen k nnen dann werden wir eine bereinkunft erzielen
5625812 die aufstellung der us raketenabwehr in osteuropa ist ein l ngerfristiger prozess
5625813 und wenn das heute eine sehr umstrittene bedrohung f r russland ist dann k nnte sie morgen oder bermorgen wirklichkeit werden deshalb m ssen wir schon jetzt asymmetrische ma nahmen ergreifen um die bedrohung zu verringern und das prinzip der garantierten nuklearen erwiderung aufrechterhalten man kann sich nicht verstecken es ist genau dieser hypothetische schlag der der eckpfeiler der russisch amerikanischen beziehungen im bereich der strategischen abschreckung bleibt
5625814 liegt ganz europa mit seinen amerikanischen milit rst tzpunkten in rum nien bulgarien und den atomwaffen in deutschland in unserer reichweite
5625815 we are currently reviewing the distributor landscape in this region to ensure we are partnering with the best distributor which matches gfi in terms of mentality and go to market strategies
5625816 we are already in discussions with a couple of vendors
5625817 we expect to have completed key initiatives to provide our customers with access to 3g services in areas covering 96 per cent of the population during the second quarter of 2009
5625818 the company will exit the year ebit positive on a monthly basis
5625819 were still working through exactly how we want to price and what price we want to put to consumers but i think it would be fair to say our roaming prices will come down
5625820 many technology companies have moved their development and support functions from australia to china and india but for red hat the growth of these two economies has contributed to the expansion of our operations in australia
5625821 a number of engineering functions are headquartered in brisbane including internationalization research and development content services which create the media and documentation for our products and localization services
5625822 the global support services team in brisbane is one of three follow the sun support centres that function 24 hours a day seven days a week
5625823 the brisbane team also provides support in english and japanese to our customers around the world and supports our technical teams across asia pacific
5625824 when a church burns down the congregation still meets and prays doesnt it
5625825 it doesnt take four walls for a community to help a family
5625826 the people who worked at sweetwater casino and the people who gathered there were a family
5625827 the regulars who came in knew each other they had their own special seats we want that back again but devins day is about the child
5625828 were setting up the sweetwater casino that day many of the employees and the customers all the familiar faces will be there
5625829 i had my doubts this would happen after the fire
5625830 this solidifies for me why we liked going to sweetwater it was the employees the way they interpreted their jobs their hearts were in the right place
5625831 it was an effort by our company to say sweetwater doesnt exist right now but its time to come together as a community to help a child in need
5625832 i wasnt sure if we could be ready this year but were giving it a shot
5625833 when the place is rebuilt we dont want a fancy ultra modern building
5625834 we want something that fits the area something rustic and quaint that uses pine and cedar
5625835 we were at the hospital when the fire occurred devin was getting chemotherapy
5625836 this new requirement addresses the need to stop flu transmission at a potential source
5625837 if they would get that done it would be a great relief
5625838 then i wont be so hesitant about her going to preschool
5625839 these vaccines have a very long track record of not only success but safety
5625840 i do not think that this should in any way be required for young children
5625841 there have not been adequate safety studies on this we dont know how children are going to react to this vaccine
5625842 its being able to be given the risks be given the benefits and decide whats appropriate for your child
5625843 this is possibly our most biblical program in the sense of welcoming the stranger
5625844 well have muslim and christian refugees too so we hope the community will welcome everyone
5625845 most anybody when they leave their country their first choice would be to go back home if they could
5625846 if you look at these groups coming here theyre among the most unlikely to go back and those having the most trouble
5625847 because we have the arabic speaking community and new jersey has a lot of diversity we do get them here
5625848 in new jersey the rent is very high and the jobs pay minimum wage
5625849 mostly we try to get them a job because we dont want to put them on public assistance
5625850 the main targets of this strike hard are fasting uighurs including cadres civil servants and students
5625851 with the strike hard activity being held around the time of ramadan uighurs will be welcoming islams holiday under an atmosphere of fear
5625852 we strongly request the international community to pay attention to chinas banning of uighurs from fasting and trampling on religious rights
5625853 some people fast some people dont its based on their practice
5625854 was never the indispensable man that george bush saw him as and he never delivered on many of the promises he made to bush
5625855 the search for al qaeda its leadership ideology and future
5625856 musharraf practiced selective counterterrorism pursuing a few top al qaeda figures such as khalid shaikh mohammed the purported mastermind of the sept 11 attacks but allowing the terrorist organization to build a new sanctuary in pakistan that is growing by the day
5625857 a friend to the us and one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism
5625858 made the critical choice to join the fight against al qaeda the taliban and other extremist groups that threaten the peace and security of pakistan its neighbors and partners throughout the world for this he has our deep gratitude
5625859 what we now need to see from pakistan is political stability and thats very important because in the pakistan afghanistan area is where in our view the current hot bed of international terrorism is he told sydney radio 2gb
5625860 weve got over 1000 troops in afghanistan in oruzgan province in areas abutting the pakistan afghanistan border regions so it has very important consequences for the safety of our troops there he added ani
5625861 but they have gone too far when they blame these two fine young lawyers as being part of the problem
5625862 and i think with all due respect the decent thing for both lynne abraham and mayor nutter to do is to extend brian mildenberg and eric zajac an apology for their vitriolic comments that were beyond the pale
5625863 this entirely sad and sickening legal circus deserves no further attention or comment
5625864 preparing for trial in the very serious criminal case against those arrested we have no further comment about the civil case
5625865 one of the most insane obscene and disgusting things ive heard in all my public life
5625866 placed its whole case for murder on a 16 year old who had consumed 80 ounces of malt liquor who had a view from a darkened park across a darkened roadway
5625867 is that it were going to hang him on that
5625868 isnt it a little late for you to be out
5625869 we made up a plan that we were going to tell the cops that nobody kicked him that there were no racial slurs there was no booze and brian got hit first
5625870 does exactly what mr ramirez was doing he throws a punch
5625871 using a 3 000 degree acetylene torch in a wood frame building is like using matches in a barn full of hay wood and flames do not mix
5625872 if one piece had been different this fire would not have started and spread the way it did
5625873 my eyes werent lying to me when i saw how fast that erupted how fast that spread
5625874 i saw the lack of retardant without the firewalls and it doesnt take a lot of brains to realize there could have been something done better or differently
5625875 now that does not mean it wasnt done according to code this is really a question of addressing code in the future
5625876 it is no longer a question of how its a question of when
5625877 it just amazes me i dont see how the american public in the end gains by all of the theatrics
5625878 mr mandracchia and the others theyre all of good will and theyre a little frustrated by lawyers arguing
5625879 the last thing we want to do is prolong this
5625880 if we are finally permitted to put on our case we will show everyone we have a very strong case
5625881 theres nothing she could say that would make their case
5625882 a distraction from what were trying to do at the park
5625883 and that doesnt serve the public the community or our heritage
5625884 the tree has multiple trunks and each has many living branches
5625885 we are hopeful that it will have new sprouting and that it will live
5625886 its bad enough to be scared in your own neighborhood but to be scared in your own home its a mess
5625887 until they lock him up im going to be here
5625888 ive got a daughter too she is 7 my wife is 22
5625889 we fight to keep the drugs out we fight to keep guns off our street we are not going to let someone like this come in and destroy our neighborhood
5625890 er doctors have to listen and take the time to appreciate symptoms from patients to treat them appropriately
5625891 in this case for whatever reasons they didnt do so and missed what were obviously neurologic problems that should have led them to order a ct scan
5625892 we feel badly that she has suffered all of these injuries from her very rare cancer
5625893 none of her injuries are related to any failure of theirs
5625894 people on medicaid dont get the same treatment in the emergency room as people with private insurance
5625895 anybody with those symptoms and a blue cross blue shield card or comparable insurance would have been ct scanned on the first visit
5625896 what is more troubling to us in this case is the fact the plaintiffs counsel would introduce issues of ethnic discrimination and discrimination based on insurance status
5625897 temple has more medicaid patients than anyone in the commonwealth of pennsylvania
5625898 i want to see if i could go to college or go to a trade school or something
5625899 the wonderful thing about having it close by is that it means there are more opportunities for all of the cultural community in philadelphia to connect and work with tyler
5625900 they had this romantic notion they wanted tyler to remain in the spot where they had gone to school
5625901 if they hadnt been back in 20 years they werent seeing how it was today
5625902 tyler is about creativity and pushing contemporary boundaries and to have anything other than a contemporary building is odd
5625903 i wish i was the law medical or business school dean
5625904 it was idyllic there were beautiful plantings it was one of those little gems that you have when youre growing up that you dont appreciate
5625905 it smelled of linseed oil which is from the oil paint its a smell that you never forget
5625906 the technology has changed the scale in which people do art now has changed and it really needs the kind of space that theyre going to have
5625907 but when they hang their bfa and mfa exhibitions nobody but us sees it
5625908 but its nice because you can really focus in your studio and be really intense
5625909 theres a certain nostalgia about the community here were very small very tight knit
5625910 maybe moving from this nice quaint little location wont be so bad
5625911 awarding the liberty medal should not be construed as an endorsement by the center of president gorbachevs views on the russia georgia conflict
5625912 for his role in ending the cold war opening his society to freedom and for allowing democratic peaceful revolutions throughout eastern europe
5625913 recent events do not change the historic nature of those accomplishments and in some ways make a pointed contrast
5625914 who have strived to secure the blessings of liberty to people the world over
5625915 matt brengt een enorme hoeveelheid real world exploit and defence ervaring met zich mee het is fantastisch om ons dit soort talenten te zien aannemen

5625917 wenn die bundeskanzlerin jetzt zu einer bildungsreise aufbricht darf es nicht nur um vorzeigeprojekte gehen das deutsche bildungssystem braucht dringend durchgreifende reformen eine sch nwettertour ist deshalb unangebracht

5625926 es sind nicht die kinder welche probleme bereiten es sind die alten welche nie gelernt haben was freude am lernen und lebenslanges lernen bedeutet
5625927 series are the lifeblood of this paper almost all our sales you understand are over the newsagents counter or from a street corner seller therefore we must have some good compelling reason in the paper every week why people should buy it the following week
5625928 that means long stories in instalments two or more running at the same time so that when one ends another is going full blast got it
5625929 we have to leave the heroine hanging over the cliff the technique comes straight from the old silent days or perhaps they got it from us
5625930 they have to buy the paper before they can read a spot news story and theyll forget it in a week that means that the biggest news story on earth if its a oncer is almost valueless to us compared with a gripping serial which will have them gasping for more and people cant forget a story when they dont know how it finishes clear on that
5625931 we always seem to have a crisis about the beginning of summer which is just when we want a really good series people start to go out more on sundays and theres a tendency for them to cut down on newspapers
5625932 we want something they cant miss even if they have to stay home now this time last year we picked up a little series from america for practically nothing what did it cost us nick the one about the negress that kept a brothel at the age of twelve
5625933 it astonished us all by putting on two hundred thousand copies right at the beginning of the holiday season we want to do the same again
5625934 of course theres always something on offer but whats around at the moment is worse than useless ive had a try on from a nun but theyre a drug on the market
5625935 one nun sells her story and they all want to thereve been three nuns confessing everything in different sundays in the past six weeks
5625936 the publics sick of them the same goes for prison reminiscences theres a hangman doing the rounds but he wants the earth for it and anyway its mainly a rehash of old murders most of which weve had we did a dope fiend last month so theyre out in short boy the cupboard is bare
5625937 its the old problem of trying to arrange unpredictable things to happen on a timetable
5625938 a problem common to all newspapers but we have it in a particularly severe form
5625939 le labo que javais visit en sous sol me faisait diablement penser une certaine crypte tr s marquante d cid ment
5625940 though the government was unable to establish beyond a reasonable doubt all the elements of the charges against velardi its conduct is well within the range of reasonableness and velardi has not provided any evidence that would allow this court to conclude otherwise
5625941 residents and county and municipal officials have not been given reasonable opportunities to work out problems with williams before this decision was issued
5625942 we have worked very hard in this county to protect the land and high quality streams
5625943 its bad enough to face pressure from developers now the federal government can come in and overrule they are making chester county pipeline central
5625944 we have said to the company to use that for work space
5625945 they said they dont want to work over their own pipes
5625946 we are going to work with the chester county conservation district and the department of environmental protection to ensure that stream banks are restored and make sure they are as good or better
5625947 made excuses for the employees outrageous lapses and for her own failure to administer any consequences for failing to do their jobs
5625948 were taking everybodys role and looking very carefully at the evidence that can be collected as a result of their role and making very thoughtful decisions about what discipline if any is appropriate
5625949 both of them have been very instrumental in some of the reform efforts over the last few years and i think have shown tremendous leadership and continue to be valuable assets to the department of human services despite the lack of oversight in the danieal kelly case
5625950 he used an enormous amount of public funds to wage political campaigns satisfy his personal needs and reward his friends
5625951 immediately fumo and arnao began extensive efforts to change and cover up their illegal conduct and fumo directed a systematic effort to destroy electronic evidence
5625952 these things are a complete out of left field surprise
5625953 the ideal way is to figure out a way to puff them up to make them bigger without changing their mass
5625954 but its hard to come up with a model that can do that

5625956 only in recent years has there been a substantial effort to manufacture child friendly formulations of first line tuberculosis drugs such as crushable mini pills granules oral suspensions
5625957 and in the past 15 years children have been included in only one study of new agents for tuberculosis a large phase 3 trial evaluating once weekly rifapentine isoniazid for treatment of latent tuberculosis
5625958 children have the same right to benefit from research as do adults
5625959 while this lack of involvement may be understandable in the short term it is not acceptable in the long term
5625960 when the prime minister travels overseas he does it because its important in our national interest to be there ms gillard told sky news
5625961 the circumstances of our pacific island neighbours matter to us and its appropriate that he is there at that major forum
5625962 we need to have security and other dialogue with our neighbours and the prime minister has been doing that ms gillard who is also education and workplace relations minister said
5625963 i love the job im doing its the job i wanted
5625964 i wanted to be there delivering our education revolution i wanted to be there to deliver a fair and balanced industrial relations system
5625965 over the long run fuel prices do have an effect a longer term process of adaption is set off the analysis said
5625966 it is possible that the recent oil price increases have set off such a process and that if oil prices remain on an upward trajectory the adaption process may still have a long way to run
5625967 condom a cappella has been designed to break down indians reluctance to discuss condom use and to make wearing a condom more acceptable
5625968 ringtones have become such personal statements that a specially created condom ringtone seemed just the right way of combining a practical message with a fun approach said radharani mitra creative director of the bbc world service trust
5625969 the idea is to tackle the inhibitions and taboos that can be associated with condoms
5625970 there are vulnerabilities all around the australian coastline she said
5625971 it is an issue of significant magnitude and it does need proper assessment and all governments working together to minimise the risks and ensure there is as little damage as possible
5625972 this really is very early work and many more factors need to be taken into account before we have concrete projections she said
5625973 it is going to be a negative story leading to damage of assets and loss of value
5625974 the evidence over the past 12 to 18 months suggests that we have underestimated how fast this aspect of the earths system can change he said
5625975 most complex and difficult challenge we have faced as a species
5625976 in the 21st century a sea level rise of at least 0 5 metres is a certainty a rise of 1 to 1 5 metres is more likely while a rise of up to four metres this century is possible he said
5625977 the pressing reality of climate change is upon us and all the evidence points to coastlines being the most vulnerable she said adding that there would be considerable damage to coastal settlements in particular aboriginal communities
5625978 our good offices are always available as long as they are agreed to by both or all the parties to conflict
5625979 nature has developed all of this firepower for getting things into cells and one of the ways is to create entities that are arginine rich
5625980 arginine rich sequences appear to figure in the mechanisms by which many pathogens invade cells
5625981 its an exciting result to be able to take a drug known to work against cancer but stymied by resistant cells and restore it to effectiveness using an arginine transporter
5625982 this bodes well for use with other drugs that succumb to resistance
5625983 if we think of the pump as being a bouncer for the cellular club then effectively what were doing is disguising one of these therapeutic agents to get it in through the back door or the side door
5625984 as the transporter with all these arginine guanidinium groups approaches the cell it basically does a handshake using hydrogen bonds with cell surface constituents that are in the membrane
5625985 in essence it changes its physical properties by shaking hands with all these cell membrane components
5625986 were seeing that when these ceramic flat irons are used at the highest heat settings and on a daily basis to achieve straight hair they can really take a toll on the structure of the hair and cause very noticeable problems that can be hard to repair
5625987 if you look at the sales statistics you see that people are pursuing straighter hair with more vigour
5625988 most people on tv and in films have straight hair and its a trend the public is trying to emulate
5625989 the problem starts when they do it wrong or too frequently and they cause a real mess that takes a long time to fix

5626055 theres been through history a lot of guys who have had trouble early in their career with injuries then gone on to play eight or 10 straight years

5626072 kami berpendapat kes ini tiada kewajaran untuk didengar sebab tiada empat saksi dan ia juga hanya harus didengar di mahkamah syariah
5626073 pada asasnya islam meletakkan peraturan yang jelas bagi memungkinkan keadilan dicapai melalui proses kehakiman dan pembuktian terlebih dahulu sebelum sebarang sumpah dilafazkan
5626074 proses pembuktian dan pengadilan akan diketepikan dan pihak yang bersalah boleh memilih untuk menggunakan sumpah bagi menyelamatkan diri daripada hukuman
5626075 dalam syariat islam kes ini diklasifikasikan sebagai kes hudud dan pendakwa wajar membawa bukti mengikut syarak bahawa perlakuan liwat berlaku dan perkara ini akan dibicarakan di mahkamah selaras kaedah feqah dan pihak pendakwa perlu mengemukakan bukti empat orang saksi manakala yang menafikan dikehendaki bersumpah

5626089 there are probably plenty of alcoholics who come to aa and leave after a while and are doing great that whole never leave or youll drink thing is bullshit
5626090 sure it does maybe not in so many words but people are always full of dire stories about anyone who leaves aa drinking again or having a miserable life
5626091 but even that is bullshit your logic is basically flawed if the people who leave and dont come back do not return to tell us what their lives are like then you are only assuming that their lives are miserable or that they drink sure the people that relapse and come back were miserable but they present only one side of the equation
5626092 heres the thing though think about all the people youve ever met in aa all the different types of people that have come through the doors all the ones youve met all the ones youve heard and heard tell of
5626093 all those big egos all those over the top personalities all those people with big chips on their shoulders with something to prove you know what ive never heard of not once in more than 20 years of aa has anyone come back and told us we were wrong that we were wasting our time
5626094 well dont you think someone somewhere would have put on their best suit and their biggest hat had the car detailed and parked it right in front of the meeting brought the hot wife or hubby in and sat them in the front row gotten up and told us we were all fools
5626095 im really sorry but its better if i leave im too angry and im going to do something ill regret if i stay

5626121 he was sailing very fast forced all his opposition to tack away and he made a tactical error and didnt go with them
5626122 they got a 30 degree wind shift and they were gone
5626123 hes not feeling very happy its a mistake and he hasnt made any in this regatta so its all on tomorrow
5626124 hes good enough that he can come out and beat these guys
5626125 hes sailed really well in the early part of the regatta and the last two days hes not quite nailed it
5626126 whether thats the other guys getting better but we always knew it was going to be pretty close
5626127 hes a strong sailor as long as he can keep his nerves together and if they have slightly stronger winds i think hell be okay
5626128 that really light stuff its tricky its not sailing i really hope he does it because one of us has to hes put the hard work in but the olympics is a funny thing
5626129 i won today but it didnt mean anything in a grand scheme of things
5626130 its not really what i came here to do and it just left me thinking what could have been too many expensive races during the regatta through no lack of trying though
5626131 i thought id be okay in the light air but im not that was a lot to do with being sick for two weeks right before it started
5626132 i only stopped antibiotics two days ago so its bloody hard to compete like that youre always slightly on the back foot because you just have not got the oomph i was completely off the pace from the beginning so even getting to the medal race was pretty good
5626133 i dont know what im doing yet but im just going to have a break maybe if its windy in london we might go but were definitely not going to race in qingdao again
5626134 well of course im concerned thats why im trying to raise him a bit differently
5626135 i will do my best when he gets to 18 he may be hard to control probably when 16 but while hes living here that will be the rule he will have to follow
5626136 things are tougher out there everyone racing for the extra dollar and maybe sometimes avoiding the meal that we should all sit and eat healthy and enjoy a glass of wine
5626137 we know that early drinking by young people predicts problems basically around alcohol so the longer you can delay young peoples drinking the better
5626138 our environment is much more driven by our binge drinking culture
5626139 and young people exposed to that normalised environment will sooner or later be exposed to binge drinking and active promotion and all those other things we really should be protecting them

5626148 it is unbelievable how life is so unpredictable and finds a way to distract and derail you from your plans my prayers are with jade her family in this hour when they face one of the biggest tests of their life in times ahead
5626149 i pray she comes out of this soon and stronger hope that she is going back with happy memories from this country
5626150 we are shocked to hear this unfortunate news jade has been very brave in the face of such a difficult situation and we are extending all possible support that she requires at this stage our prayers are with her
5626151 it is indeed an unfortunate development and we extend full support to jade in this testing time jade is a strong willed woman who has emerged victorious from many battles we sincerely hope that she wins this time as well
5626152 its all a bit sad to be honest with you
5626153 if she loves him then good for her but if it was done for attention its a bit sad
5626154 i did stuff like that when i was 19 as well like get a tattoo because it annoyed my mum
5626155 its just a great big cry for help and if anything people need to stop talking about her badly and you know maybe all she needs is a hug
5626156 it is a great honour to welcome a star of the calibre of amitabh bachchan to leicester to contribute to this important cause and one which i know will delight all local people
5626157 we have to get behind him because he is a tremendous force and is of tremendous importance for the team
5626158 what happened in the transfer period did not always reflect his deep desire and there was manipulation from agents on both sides but overall i am positive he will recover
5626159 the lads were winning 2 1 but then in the last minute gael gave away a really stupid penalty
5626160 at the same time he played brilliantly all season he improved immensely and turned into a great defender as a result but he messed up that day
5626161 i dont think something similar would happen to him now because hes a lot more experienced
5626162 andy comes to us with considerable premier league experience for a player of his age
5626163 the squad is as strong as weve had on paper
5626164 we just have to replicate the paper and make sure we put on a performance
5626165 the one thing we have got is that everyone in this squad is fighting for their place its not a foregone conclusion who plays in the first xi thats credit to the players theyve created that pressure
5626166 the players know that if they do well enough my recommendation will go straight to fabio
5626167 i think you just have those games where you feel like youre hitting the ball well
5626168 at the moment i feel like im striking the ball as good as i have ever have
5626169 stats are irrelevant the biggest thing is if the teams going well then im happy
5626170 i dont think i played a game healthy last season i was at about 50 or 60 at best
5626171 when i had another scan on the knee this summer it had not improved so i came back early to try to fix it at the beginning of pre season
5626172 whether i am fit for portsmouth or the match after that the most important thing is i am healthy for the rest of the season
5626173 i have not even come close to fulfilling my potential yet and providing i stay healthy this could be a really big season for me
5626174 its frustrating ive missed a lot of football since the munster final my fitness is not as good as it should be
5626175 it his hamstring recovery is coming on fairly okay but until i test it if i test it too soon i will be gone for the game
5626176 i have only done 10 or 15 minutes the last couple of nights
5626177 whoever will proudly dispute and contradict will always stand outside the door christ the master of humility manifests his truth only to the humble and hides himself from the proud
5626178 we didnt get in this drought in one month and were not going to get out of it with one rainfall event even if it does bring three inches
5626179 i hate to say even if it brings five inches to the upstate across every county its not going to completely eliminate or alleviate the drought conditions that we have in place
5626180 while our case has been aggravated by the illegal sanctions imposed by the western powers rising food prices are a world phenomenon because of the use of bio fuel
5626181 but we will continue to fight inflation by making sure that prices charged are realistic
5626182 i love the fraternity brothers because theyre so young and such a contrasting team
5626183 one takes his time to think things out the other one loves to rush and go at a million miles an hour theres definitely tension between the two of them while theyre making decisions during the race
5626184 they are small we wanted to make sure that there wasnt anything to prevent us from putting that pack underneath the seat in front of us when we got on a plane we didnt want something to happen where we got delayed because of our luggage we thought that would help us go faster
5626185 we did extensive research on what to wear what was lightweight and would help us move the fastest
5626186 i think it was the longest i ever went without wearing a logo on my t shirt
5626187 we both tried to do some training along the lines of going down to our little gym but that was pretty much it
5626188 we have an emerging farm so we do a lot of work out there splitting wood and taking care of the horses
5626189 people were a little afraid we were going to pull a borat on them i told them we werent doing borat but what happened there is very very funny its not easy to shoot in places like that because they practically have no television industry
5626190 the teams have no idea how to get from point a to point b there
5626191 they dont know the language its very difficult to get through this country they get so stuck but they find so many fascinating solutions of how to get through everything one of the things the teams do there is go to a real life floating village its insane

5626210 ringtones have become such personal statements that a specially created condom ringtone seemed just the right way of combining a practical message with a fun approach said radharani mitra creative director of the bbc world service trust
5626211 the idea is to tackle the inhibitions and taboos that can be associated with condoms

5626216 were seeing that when these ceramic flat irons are used at the highest heat settings and on a daily basis to achieve straight hair they can really take a toll on the structure of the hair and cause very noticeable problems that can be hard to repair
5626217 if you look at the sales statistics you see that people are pursuing straighter hair with more vigour
5626218 most people on tv and in films have straight hair and its a trend the public is trying to emulate
5626219 the problem starts when they do it wrong or too frequently and they cause a real mess that takes a long time to fix
5626220 if you want to join the trend fine but do it with common sense or you could wind up with massive damage
5626221 unfortunately couldnt go on the the world spanning scouting trip for the next season of the reality competition show
5626222 i love the fraternity brothers because theyre so young and such a contrasting team
5626223 one takes his time to think things out the other one loves to rush and go at a million miles an hour theres definitely tension between the two of them while theyre making decisions during the race
5626224 they are small we wanted to make sure that there wasnt anything to prevent us from putting that pack underneath the seat in front of us when we got on a plane we didnt want something to happen where we got delayed because of our luggage we thought that would help us go faster
5626225 we did extensive research on what to wear what was lightweight and would help us move the fastest
5626226 i think it was the longest i ever went without wearing a logo on my t shirt
5626227 we both tried to do some training along the lines of going down to our little gym but that was pretty much it
5626228 we have an emerging farm so we do a lot of work out there splitting wood and taking care of the horses
5626229 people were a little afraid we were going to pull a borat on them i told them we werent doing borat but what happened there is very very funny its not easy to shoot in places like that because they practically have no television industry
5626230 the teams have no idea how to get from point a to point b there
5626231 they dont know the language its very difficult to get through this country they get so stuck but they find so many fascinating solutions of how to get through everything one of the things the teams do there is go to a real life floating village its insane
5626232 unfortunately couldnt go on the the world spanning scouting trip for the next season of the reality competition show
5626233 we found absolutely no olympic fakes in the pearl market
5626234 well probably take a few pins home and i think the fuwas are really cute but that will be about it
5626235 its all pretty tacky cheap and cheerful trinkets but nothing youd really want to take home
5626236 i had a really bad start it was very hard to focus when my competitors were gaining points on me
5626237 at the end of the first of four legs in the medal race she was eighth out of the 10 boats that made the final and at end of the next leg she was next to last then heading up on the third leg she spotted a wind shift and set off on a different course than most of the fleet
5626238 i wasnt winning at that point and i saw this big left puff and i went like here goes
5626239 i went left and moved to the front of the fleet
5626240 the gamble paid off and the end of the third leg she had climbed to no
5626241 i am also very happy to get the first olympic sailing medal for my country
5626242 but i just had to do what i had to do
5626243 i was lucky because the second place swedish guy was very close to goodison so goodison was watching him and keeping him behind pity for him but it left just three of us for two other medals
5626244 it was a good performance against orazgaliyev in the pre quarters
5626245 you could hear her going on and on because she was standing right behind the stage curtain
5626246 shes talking and talking meanwhile you have the entire audience waiting almost two hours for the taping to start
5626247 she leaves us waiting and everyone is sitting there complaining and then she comes out and doesnt say a word about it she didnt even say hello she got right into her script
5626248 tyra kept saying when i was a model and would hardly let them talk it was all about her as usual
5626249 she had the audience prance down the street and then release black balloons
5626250 it is unbelievable how life is so unpredictable and finds a way to distract and derail you from your plans my prayers are with jade her family in this hour when they face one of the biggest tests of their life in times ahead
5626251 i pray she comes out of this soon and stronger hope that she is going back with happy memories from this country
5626252 it is indeed an unfortunate development and we extend full support to jade in this testing time jade is a strong willed woman who has emerged victorious from many battles we sincerely hope that she wins this time as well

5626254 i actually had a heat lamp at one point and a tray of sand so that people could think they were on the beach but that was a bit too far
5626255 there are vulnerabilities all around the australian coastline she said
5626256 it is an issue of significant magnitude and it does need proper assessment and all governments working together to minimise the risks and ensure there is as little damage as possible
5626257 this really is very early work and many more factors need to be taken into account before we have concrete projections she said
5626258 it is going to be a negative story leading to damage of assets and loss of value
5626259 the evidence over the past 12 to 18 months suggests that we have underestimated how fast this aspect of the earths system can change he said
5626260 most complex and difficult challenge we have faced as a species
5626261 in the 21st century a sea level rise of at least 0 5 metres is a certainty a rise of 1 to 1 5 metres is more likely while a rise of up to four metres this century is possible he said
5626262 the pressing reality of climate change is upon us and all the evidence points to coastlines being the most vulnerable she said adding that there would be considerable damage to coastal settlements in particular aboriginal communities

5626264 the fact that ukraine is no longer a party to the 1992 agreement allows it to launch active cooperation with european countries to integrate its stations with governments with an interest in receiving data of the situation in space
5626265 we dont want to be in a situation where we are in some kind of frozen relationship
5626266 but until russia pulls its forces out of georgia and respects international norms of the 21st century we just cant go on with business as usual
5626267 if these decisions are in fact taken on behalf of the georgian aggressor we will not be able to maintain the quality and the schedule of our relationship with nato
5626268 we have a serious temptation to bring all our potential cooperation with nato under question
5626269 russias leaders are seriously considering supporting prime minister yulia tymoshenko in the presidential campaign once she fulfils the condition of adopting a passive position in the conflict with georgia
5626270 fully fledged work in the interests of the russian side
5626271 the public has a right to know how far politicians will go beyond the boundary where political battles end and the betrayal of national interests begins
5626272 were sure that the russians started the fires in our woods
5626273 local people say that the fires were started by russian helicopters they flew over the forests and then the fires started
5626274 now the russians are not allowing aviation teams from ukraine and turkey to help put out the fires
5626275 this is the biggest coniferous forest in the caucasus and is home to chamois bears and the caucasus red deer
5626276 if you put together a big wave with small children you get disaster
5626277 so it was really important to have this piece of legislation to regulate the wave pools
5626278 the question before us then becomes at what point do you expect people to exercise a motive of parental responsibility and common sense when going to a water park where the chief object of said water park is to enjoy the waves that it generates
5626279 women are delaying their childbearing until they complete their educations
5626280 this is the first time weve looked at a lot of these characteristics
5626281 that to me is counter intuitive because a large share of our poor population is latino and they tend to have higher birth rates
5626282 tend to be two parent families and overwhelmingly working and because if youre undocumented youre not eligible for cash assistance programs
5626283 we are a religiously pluralistic state there are many kinds of people who have to live together in california and i think the court framed this decision to make crystal clear that all patients must receive equal services regardless of the reason that an individual health care practitioner might have for wanting to turn people away
5626284 do the rights of religious freedom and free speech as guaranteed in both the federal and the california constitutions exempt a medical clinics physicians from complying with the california unruh civil rights acts prohibition against discrimination
5626285 californias compelling interest in ensuring full and equal access to medical treatment irrespective of sexual orientation
5626286 this decision may have a big impact on californias proposition 8 the initiative to protect traditional marriage as voters begin to recognize the radical agenda of our opposition
5626287 the ruling is an important one for california and beyond because it stands for the general principle that when you engage in discriminatory conduct in this case the refusal to treat someone in a medical setting based on their sexual orientation you cant claim that conduct has first amendment protection
5626288 you are a business and as a business non discrimination laws apply to you the same way they apply to any business
5626289 this just adds fuel to that fire and underscores the urgency for cultural conservatives at winning where they can win
5626290 i wanted to create a policy that would tell everyone how we are going to go about evaluating fire stations
5626291 san jose doesnt have a good policy to determine how to close fire stations

5626304 gates is an anomaly in this lame duck administration he is still firing on all cylinders working to repair the damage done at the pentagon by his arrogant and aloof predecessor donald rumsfeld

5626314 there was less blood loss with this procedure than with conventional surgery and there is the potential for a faster recovery
5626315 the results were outstanding and suggest the robot assisted surgery is an attractive option for fistulas that would normally require abdominal surgery
5626316 robot assisted surgery has promise to bridge the limitations of laparoscopic surgery and allow more women with fistulas urinary incontinence or prolapsed pelvic organs to benefit from a minimally invasive approach
5626317 timing andthe extent of degradation should be carefully selected according to thechanging requirements of the ongoing dynamic repair process
5626318 moreover since cspg is a majorconstituent of the glial scar the present findings raises thepotential need to revisit the overall perception of the glial scar andits role in recovery a better understanding of the regulation of thescar tissue and the role of the naturally occurring cspg in health anddisease will enable us to increase the benefit of endogenous repairmechanisms and improve many of the available therapies for cns injury
5626319 clearly the nature of farm work carries more inherent risk than most other occupations these risks include use of heavy machinery the use of chemicals working in poor or dangerous weather conditions and working at heights

5626321 cerebral malaria is lethal 20 percent of the time in the best of hands and here weve shown that something as simple as aspirin because of its affect on platelets might be able to improve the outcomes of those who contract this deadly form of the disease
5626322 the take home lesson is that platelets by releasing pf4 are playing an early role in the wind up phase of cerebral malaria
5626323 our mouse studies show that timing is critical with the mice we know when we infected them and controlled when we treated them a big challenge in translating this to humans is that people dont know when they get infected
5626324 platelets dont get any respect but theyre the second most abundant cell in the blood after red blood cells and packed full of factors that rally the immune system to action by taking what we know about platelets and their activation and applying it to malaria we have found a driver of cerebral malaria
5626325 the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver that pregnancy
5626326 the evidence regarding the relative mental health risks associated with multiple abortions is more uncertain
5626327 no evidence sufficient to support the claim that an observed association between abortion history and mental health was caused by the abortion per se as opposed to other factors
5626328 global statements about the psychological impact of abortion can be misleading

5626330 while we are awaiting the results from large clinical trials this information can be helpful to doctors and patients alike who are looking for circumstantial evidence regarding the role of psa screening
5626331 this research can be added to the body of literature suggesting that screening may reduce prostate cancer deaths
5626332 while the us preventive task force recommends against screening for older men these results and other published studies show that psa screening may be an effective tool in reducing the number of prostate cancer deaths
5626333 psa tests should be discussed between a man and his primary care physician while taking into consideration his overall health profile rather than his age
5626334 as we have known there is no convincing evidence that abortion is a significant cause of psychiatric illness we must distinguish illnesses from feelings a woman may have many emotional reactions to an unwanted pregnancy and abortion most commonly relief but also sadness and a sense of loss these feelings can coexist and like feelings about any important life decision they can vary over time negative feelings often stem from the circumstances that led the woman to terminate the pregnancy such as an abusive relationship or a lack of social supports or from the circumstances of the abortion itself such as demonstrators at an abortion facility women have abortions because they understand the importance of good mothering they want to have wanted babies and to be able to give those babies what they need to grow up loved healthy and happy each woman contemplating abortion has her own history circumstances and values no one else can fully understand her individual situation every pregnant woman who is considering abortion has a right to accurate medical information about the risks and benefits of either continuing or terminating the pregnancy and to whatever medical and mental health care she wants and needs decisions about reproductive health should be made between a woman her family and her doctor the best way to protect the mental health of women considering abortion is to ensure that they have accurate unbiased information receive good medical care and are given support by family and friends whether they decide to continue or terminate their pregnancies the american psychiatric association opposes all constitutional amendments legislation and regulations restricting family planning and abortion services to any segment of the population

5626410 were currently carrying out enquiries into how this crash happened gathering evidence from the scene and speaking to witnesses
5626411 this is likely to take some time given the nature of the incident and the diverse background of those involved we have a number of interpreters helping us and our officers are currently liaising with the relevant embassies to keep them fully informed

5626413 i heard this massive crash and rumble crunching metal it sounded initially like a thunderstorm but then we heard shouts and screams
5626414 from what i could see a coach had crashed at the hill and ploughed through a neighbours garden it ploughed through two cars parked in a driveway one of them was bouncing down the road the other must have flown along with the coach
5626415 it must have dropped about 20ft it was on a slope there were people climbing out of the fire exits on the bus the majority were walking wounded
5626416 theres a bad bend at the bottom of the hill which is in line with the neighbours driveway they couldnt have managed to take the corner and had no choice but to go through
5626417 its an extremely dangerous road a narrow country road its mayhem absolute mayhem we had a torrential downpour just before it happened i was in the pub when someone came in screaming for blankets and sheets we all went to help but the area had been cordoned off
5626418 the bail out itself isnt what scares investors per se as these government sponsored enterprises gses have always been implicitly backed by the us government however the fact that they have to be bailed out doesnt bode well for the housing financial sector and more specifically the mortgage related investments that sparked the credit crunch in the first place
5626419 the us is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come

5626423 i cant believe they were negligent in not taking him to the hospital i just cant understand that and i just cant understand why they let them go for that

5626443 the struggling companies are getting an even tougher road in the near future the question also is do they really have the resources the cash here
5626444 i think there is little question that the domestic automakers are somewhat strapped for resources and they have to go out and borrow money and stuff like that
5626445 whenever they have to do that it is difficult to come up with the same level of quality and the same level of customer satisfaction
5626446 the cost reduction program introduced by the new management will see an annualized cost reduction of 16 0 million most all of the reduction initiatives were completed in q1 and q2 2008 and we started seeing the impact on cost in q2 further benefits of the cost reduction program will be seen gradually throughout the financial year 2008

5626450 if you look at the dram industry right now quite frankly they are done as price reductions they are really right now all below their costs we have a die size and cost structure that is much lower than dram we think we can enter the market at a parity as we are going to go to the 45 nm the 32 nm the 25 nm which we are currently very hardly pushing here the difference between us and dram on cost is going to be wider which we are currently considering this to give price concessions to our customers to essentially incentivize them to work with us even more

5626455 this may help explain why children in numerate cultures with developmental dyscalculia find it so difficult to learn arithmetic
5626456 although they have plenty of formal and informal opportunities to learn to count with words and do arithmetic the innate mechanism on which skilled arithmetic is based may have developed atypically

5626471 the indian governments responsibility to protect civilians from attacks by militants is no excuse for an abusive law like the afspa
5626472 fifty years of suffering under the afspa is 50 years too long the government should repeal the afspa now
5626473 violations under the afspa have served as a recruiting agent for militant groups
5626474 in both kashmir and the northeast we have heard over and over again that abuses by troops who are never punished for their crimes have only shrunk the space for those supporting peaceful change
5626475 the indian government acted with principle when it repealed the controversial prevention of terrorism act
5626476 it must display the same courage now in repealing afspa

5626487 we are now into the final stretch the government of c te divoire has contracted the sagem company and the un has helped to transport material
5626488 by working together we will succeed in meeting the 30 november deadline for the elections
5626489 we have promoted the idea of these projects and we have already explained to the majority of ex combatants how they can be used and 99 out of 100 are waiting to sign up to begin a project
5626490 i am very satisfied and encouraged i will study the possibility of making odi nn a testing ground for the quick impact projects from unoci since i am aware of the enormous needs that this region of the country has

5626493 the last i voted was 10 years ago when i was at my home on vacation in total i have voted only four times
5626494 though there are proxy voting system and postal ballot system in place things have not materialised as they were desired
5626495 i have never voted during my 16 years of service during the last general election i received my postal ballot well after the new government was formed
5626496 we are aware there are problems but the decision has to be taken by the government another possible solution to the problem can be that a soldier is allowed to vote wherever he is posted at the time of elections
5626497 we have been getting a lot of complaints from soldiers as they have been unable to cast their votes we will soon hold a meeting with the election commission in this regard
5626498 it is dreadfully disappointing for all the horses and their sections who have been looking forward to running and the thousands of race goers looking forward to coming to the city
5626499 some of the attackers were exploding their explosives tied around their bodies before the forces could arrest them
5626500 it was a difficult decision for them but now they have left to see how things are in basra
5626501 but they were also troubled by the attention their case had generated
5626502 the law grants the military wide powers to arrest without warrant shoot to kill and destroy property in so called disturbed areas it also protects military personnel responsible for serious crimes from prosecution creating a pervasive culture of impunity
5626503 the afspa was enacted by parliament with a view to quelling the naga insurgency in 1958 but after that there were so many insurgencies in the northeast and despite the act in force in all the insurgency hit states yet militancy is thriving in other words the afspa had miserably failed
5626504 i am not going to withdraw my fast until this black act is repealed in its totality from manipur
5626505 if timely action is not taken to repeal the act the northeast would be in turmoil
5626506 the final push for musharraf came from the army top brass which was sucked into this controversy by the outgoing dictator himself primarily to save his skin from a sure impeachment
5626507 the rajasthan police team approached us after getting some information about his native place
5626508 vishwanath told us that he went to rajasthan and was caught by some uniformed men from a deserted place
5626509 it is possible that he crossed the international border and was caught by the pakistan army the rajasthan police team informed us
5626510 in the rainforest exposure to light during the day causes them to switch off but in caves there is no light to cause that to happen however they switch off of their own accord and they do it in synchrony
5626511 the most unexpected result of the study was they are out of sync with their surface relatives they glow most brightly when it is daylight outside the cave
5626512 the more we know about the factors that influence the glow intensity the better off managers of these sites will be in ensuring that the display is as attractive as possible while maintaining the long term health of the glow worm colonies
5626513 we will pursue and take aggressive actions against the perpetrators of these dastardly acts against innocent civilians
5626514 we will continue with the operations it will not stop with the clearing of the areas occupied by them
5626515 we cannot forever take the convenient excuse from the hierarchy of a group that is supposedly talking peace with the government
5626516 it is their responsibility if they are really sincere and well meaning to rein in their forces
5626517 the government has no option but to bear it out we have to wait and watch to see where things go from here
5626518 let things drift as there is no solution we hope the people protesting in jammu and kashmir will soon be back on the negotiating table
5626519 the resonance will be there in the hindi belt there are three fault lines religion caste and economic disparity that run in our country if the bjp becomes successful in pressing one among them you can see the affect
5626520 the security forces cannot open fire on peaceful protesters and we have to be very cautious on such issues
5626521 the government knows how to use force to tackle the situation but we are taking a calculated approach moreover this years amarnath yatra is over successfully and we have one year to decide the issue
5626522 i am opening my shop after so many days but i am apprehensive god save us we were about to run out of rations

5626525 ik trek het mij persoonlijk aan dat u de waarde van uw beleggingen zo hebt zien kelderen
5626526 de overgrote meerderheid van aandeelhouders groot en klein en ook van onze klanten is gelukkig en steunt ons
5626527 kunnen wij conclusies aan deze bijeenkomst verbinden kunnen wij ons erop beroepen
5626528 dit soort avonden zullen we op reguliere basis voor u organiseren
5626529 eigenlijk heb ik niet zo veel grote zorgen over dit bedrijf alle financi le fondsen hebben het momenteel zwaar ik dacht dat ik fortis op het dieptepunt kocht op 12 euro als ik een zorg heb gaat die over het geringe vertrouwen dat er bestaat in de financi le sector in het algemeen maar ik denk dat in 2009 en 2010 het vertrouwen weer terug zal keren
5626530 wat gaan ze doen om het geschonden vertrouwen van de aandeelhouders te herstellen
5626531 een speciale aandeelhoudersvergadering zoals door de veb wordt voorgesteld is naar mijn mening overdreven er zijn wel enkele onderdelen uit het tienpuntenplan van de veb die volgens mij belangrijk zijn fortis zou bijvoorbeeld de risico en controlesystemen moeten versterken ook zou het bedrijf moeten werken aan de transparantie en die verbeteren zoals is voorgesteld
5626532 ik erger me groen en geel aan de mediahetze die dit bedrijf treft de georkestreerde campagne van de veb beleggersvereniging red heeft de problemen waarin fortis verkeert verergerd het begon met de kritiek op de beloning van bestuursvoorzitter votron vervolgens stapt meneer slagter directeur van de veb red het fortiskantoor binnen met een cameraploeg van het journaal in zijn kielzog en dan komt de beschuldiging van misleiding aan het adres van de raad van bestuur allemaal negatieve kritiek die niet het belang van de aandeelhouders heeft gediend
5626533 wanneer houdt de veb nu eens op met die hetze
5626534 votron moet terugkeren als bestuursvoorzitter hij is een fantastische vent een ziener met amerikaanse doortastendheid alleen hij is in staat om fortis weer uit de problemen te krijgen het is een schande dat hij het veld heeft moeten ruimen
5626535 flink verlies ik heb mn aandelen gekocht voor ruim 24 euro nu staat de koers onder de 10
5626536 de situatie met de kredietcrisis bezorgt alle beleggers veel onzekerheid maar voor de aandeelhouders van dit bedrijf is het extra pijnlijk dat het bestuur anders dan beloofd toch zijn dividendbeleid heeft gewijzigd het dividend zou dit jaar gelijk blijven en wat heeft men gedaan het interimdividend is geschrapt
5626537 mijn aandelenbelang is te klein om echt boos te zijn maar ik ben erg benieuwd of het management eigenlijk zelf weet of alle leed nu is geschikt de onverwachte kapitaalmaatregelen van eind juni bewijzen dat de raad van bestuur er goed in is zaken te onderschatten

5626549 nog een laatste oproep aan het boic de volgorde van onze 4x100 meter ploeg is verkeerd
5626550 our patients have been asking for a way to solve a number of skin issues without the need for surgery or multiple procedures california lifestyles almost guarantee an unpleasant change in skin texture and color balance with evidence of premature aging the natural progression of collagen breakdown eventually presents itself by way of wrinkles and skin laxity the re pair laser targets all these issues with a short downtime one time procedure
5626551 granted in the case of severe laxity the re pair does not replace traditional plastic surgery but when used correctly in the hands of a skilled and experienced laser physician it can provide a single treatment solution to the multiple problems created by sun damage and the initial laxity caused by aging were successfully treating patients well into their 60s before the re pair laser there was no way you could get this multiple effect response without serious and complicated recovery time
5626552 we are using the re pair clinically to improve the surface plane of the skin for those suffering from acne scarring
5626553 much acne scarred skin has developed deep tough scar membrane which is resistant to surface depth procedures making it very difficult to restore a level skin surface
5626554 fully combating the effects of age related facial laxity is not just a matter of tightening volume deficits are created by bone loss and fat loss in the skin volume restoration plays an important part in rebalancing the 3 d contours of the face
5626555 blend in volume restoration using injectables such as radiesse and sculptra with the fraxel re pair and i wont be surprised to see some phenomenal outcomes
5626556 my newest co2touch technique delivers the gas in such a manner that i can customize the treatment for each patient to ensure a virtually pain free experience i am also seeing more dramatic results sooner with the heated gas and my modified techniques in fact the new device and techniques have cut the number of actual patient visits in half versus the older protocol
5626557 the treatment takes only five minutes and it is virtually painless and risk free a series of 4 6 treatments spaced one week apart is all that is required to achieve an optimal result

5626593 with the passage of crucial housing legislation last month that created an attractive home buyer tax credit there is a sense that home sales may soon be reaching a turning point
5626594 builders are anticipating the stimulative effects of this legislation and are optimistic that the tax credit will give those buyers whove been sitting on the fence the reason they need to jump back into the market
5626595 while our overall measure of builder confidence remains at a record low at this time it is a good sign that two out of three of the hmis component indexes rose in august and this may be an indication that we are nearing the bottom of the long downswing in new home sales
5626596 our current forecast shows stabilization of sales during the second half of this year followed by solid recovery in 2009 and beyond
5626597 mortgage lending activity remains relatively weak and will decline further in the coming months as a result of funding constraints and lower consumer demand
5626598 this is a strong performance in a market that is unrecognisable from the same period in 2007
5626599 having access to your finances whenever you want and seeing what is going in and coming out puts you in a good place
5626600 we dont have this practice in islam it is the christians who swear on the bible
5626601 again you have heard that it was said to the people long ago do not break your oath but keep the oaths you have made to the lord but i tell you do not swear at all either by heaven for it is gods throne or by the earth for it is his footstool or by jerusalem for it is the city of the great king and do not swear by your head for you cannot make even one hair white or black simply let your yes be yes and your no no anything beyond this comes from the evil one
5626602 above all my brothers do not swear not by heaven or by earth or by anything else

5626605 we drilled repeatedly to cope with 30 odd anticipated situations including comprehensive self defense in barrack areas self defense for troops on the move self defense at construction sites self defense in case we encounter armed conflict and made preplans for dealing with hijacking by armed gangsters what if we get into areas conflict by mistake and what if we step into mine areas by mistake
5626606 for me its a very special day because what we need most is the engineering capacity to build and expand our camps to allow us to increase the numbers of our deployed forces
5626607 we will not lie in wait for the inevitable margin slashing that we still bear the scars of farmers have to protect themselves the nfu has long been calling for better contracts in the dairy industry which offer greater clarity transparency and stability for dairy farmers

5626609 they had no idea what was going on at the time and i felt i couldnt tell them because i thought i had been doing something wrong we are a close family emotionally and they now know what happened
5626610 when they found out they were stunned and very angry
5626611 a lot of things have started to make sense to them as a result though i went off the rails a bit as a kid at times i feel angry and frustrated other times i feel sorry for him that he is the way he is
5626612 it doesnt give me any satisfaction to know he will be punished but i am glad that he has been stopped and that he wont be able to do this to anyone else
5626613 while our case has been aggravated by the illegal sanctions imposed by the western powers rising food prices are a world phenomenon because of the use of bio fuel
5626614 but we will continue to fight inflation by making sure that prices charged are realistic

5626629 a group of 30 mujahedeen holy fighters armed with rifles and suicide jackets attacked the american base in khost
5626630 we had a fight through the night and it is ongoing
5626631 but i love it at worcester and i just want to get on and play now
5626632 i have an ambition to play for england and the club say theyll support me in those sorts of goals
5626633 the support i have received from my fianc e family team mates supporters and the club has been overwhelming
5626634 i am really pleased to continue my career with worcestershire and i am looking forward to taking the field with the current squad of talented worcestershire players and competing for trophies and championships in the future
5626635 stephen has really shown his true worth to the team this season
5626636 he is undoubtedly one the leading batsmen in the country
5626637 he and daryl mitchell are fast becoming one of the most reliable opening partnerships in the county championship and i am pleased we will see this partnership develop over the next few years
5626638 i know that stephen has aspirations to play for england and it is well known how committed we are to developing players for england its testament to the club that he has chosen to pursue those aspirations with us when so many counties were after his signature
5626639 i know you ive read your stuff you and arn and all those other guys
5626640 productive making possible the achievement of certain ends that in its absence would not be possible
5626641 the first race of the regatta youre always a little jittery just getting used to your surroundings
5626642 weve been training here for 10 days i want to race
5626643 you just have to have races under your belt which i do
5626644 watching those guys come through in the clutch was fantastic
5626645 they are good friends of mine who can feel vindicated and satisfied
5626646 i kind of fought my way on there and i thought theres no time like the present
5626647 i tried to make it a battle of pure willpower i gave it everything i had
5626648 i wanted to stop and watch the rest of the race
5626649 i was so close to stopping it was so exciting
5626650 there was a lot of controversy about the decision to use this strategy and do this as a team for simon but look what happened a medal for canada
5626651 look what hes done for his sport a medal for his country what more can you say i was more than happy to play my part
5626652 i think the youth from 12 to 18 are kind of lost they dont know their place in the tribe
5626653 what happened to the girls over at beaver creek sad to say it woke everybody up right its sad to say that it took their deaths to bring our tribe together as one
5626654 we need more parental supervision we need more guidance we need more activities out there that will keep kids involved
5626655 we need a recreation area around here where kids can play basketball
5626656 kids drop out of school and dont finish their education
5626657 i think my daughter tried a little too hard to try to fit in she was an impressionable age
5626658 that seems to be like a normal thing on the reservation like drugs and alcohol and she was exposed to it more and i dont know that she knew how to handle it
5626659 we have a long waiting list of people waiting to go to treatment
5626660 made no enquiries that would permit her to determine the ability of miss irving to parent this child
5626661 the judge was the only person that child had to look after her katelynn was betrayed let down
5626662 indicate whether or not this judges behaviour met the standard that we should expect of judges
5626663 ill be here im not going away until shes off the bench
5626664 we want to see how frequent this occurs what steps might be taken do all judges approach this in the same way those kinds of things
5626665 i flew in two days ago to prepare the boat
5626666 not much to do on a dock like this but add extra lines and make sure the boat can rise and fall with the tide
5626667 this isnt a hurricane if the media wasnt down here hyping this up this would be a non event
5626668 after seeing what happened in new orleans and that area i think early evacuation of visitors is important for safety especially in the keys where we only have one road out lives are more important than revenue
5626669 i challenge you to help us change public attitudes to help reduce stigma and discrimination you can play an invaluable role in improving the lives of people living with mental illness by becoming a community leader on the stigma issue
5626670 one of the first targets for our anti stigma campaign is health care professionals
5626671 they are far more likely to harm themselves than others
5626672 with five blokes to every girl may i suggest that beauty disadvantaged women should proceed to mount isa
5626673 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
5626674 some in other places in australia need to proceed to mount isa where happiness awaits really beauty is only skin deep isnt there a fairy tale about an ugly duckling that evolves into a beautiful swan
5626675 theres a lot of anger circulating among the community at the moment a lot of passionate anger theres a lot of women voicing their opinions
5626676 now beauty is in the eye of the beholder beauty can be a good set of teeth beauty is nice wavy hair beauty can be blue eyes or green eyes there is such a thing as disposition temperament manners general attractiveness attitude and demeanour all those things tend to make a person attractive
5626677 returning us to the dark ages and making the guys that live in this town seem like sex hungry men that will pounce upon the first girl that they see walking down the street
5626678 it paints the women here as second rate and suggests the men will settle for anything i think its quite disgusting
5626679 anyone who moves to mount isa beautiful or not so beautiful they have a great chance to make a great life here it is a fantastic town
5626680 if guys have the right attitude then you know any type of girl will be happy to be with them so maybe the guys need to fix their attitudes a little bit
5626681 if i was doing this just for myself i might have chosen a different course but i put pakistan first as always
5626682 this is the first time in pakistans political history where you have the people winning against establishment institutions
5626683 today parliament has become sovereign we can hold our head up high in the world and say that we too are a democracy
5626684 i dont want anything from anybody i have no interest i leave my future in the hands of the nation and people
5626685 even if i beat this impeachment relations between the presidency and the government can never be fixed pillars of the state parliament and the judiciary would be harmed and god forbid the army might have been dragged in
5626686 no charge sheet can stand against me because i never did anything for myself whatever i did i put pakistan first
5626687 we will continue to work with the pakistani government and political leaders and urge them to redouble their focus on pakistans future and its most urgent needs including stemming the growth of extremism addressing food and energy shortages and improving economic stability

5626691 andy comes to us with considerable premier league experience for a player of his age
5626692 we have to get behind him because he is a tremendous force and is of tremendous importance for the team
5626693 what happened in the transfer period did not always reflect his deep desire and there was manipulation from agents on both sides but overall i am positive he will recover
5626694 the lads were winning 2 1 but then in the last minute gael gave away a really stupid penalty
5626695 at the same time he played brilliantly all season he improved immensely and turned into a great defender as a result but he messed up that day
5626696 i dont think something similar would happen to him now because hes a lot more experienced
5626697 hij zette zich in voor alfabetisme en mensenrechten hij was er altijd en daarom zijn wij nu allemaal hier voor hem
5626698 nature has developed all of this firepower for getting things into cells and one of the ways is to create entities that are arginine rich
5626699 arginine rich sequences appear to figure in the mechanisms by which many pathogens invade cells
5626700 its an exciting result to be able to take a drug known to work against cancer but stymied by resistant cells and restore it to effectiveness using an arginine transporter
5626701 this bodes well for use with other drugs that succumb to resistance
5626702 if we think of the pump as being a bouncer for the cellular club then effectively what were doing is disguising one of these therapeutic agents to get it in through the back door or the side door
5626703 as the transporter with all these arginine guanidinium groups approaches the cell it basically does a handshake using hydrogen bonds with cell surface constituents that are in the membrane
5626704 in essence it changes its physical properties by shaking hands with all these cell membrane components
5626705 was never the indispensable man that george bush saw him as and he never delivered on many of the promises he made to bush
5626706 the search for al qaeda its leadership ideology and future
5626707 musharraf practiced selective counterterrorism pursuing a few top al qaeda figures such as khalid shaikh mohammed the purported mastermind of the sept 11 attacks but allowing the terrorist organization to build a new sanctuary in pakistan that is growing by the day
5626708 a friend to the us and one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism
5626709 made the critical choice to join the fight against al qaeda the taliban and other extremist groups that threaten the peace and security of pakistan its neighbors and partners throughout the world for this he has our deep gratitude
5626710 postoperative ileus inability of the intestines to pass contents is regarded as an inevitable response to the trauma of abdominal surgery and is a major contributing factor to postoperative pain and discomfort associated with abdominal distension nausea vomiting and cramping pain
5626711 postoperative length of hospital stay was assessed in four trials comprising 134 patients
5626712 this was also reduced in the chewing gum group by longer than one day however this result was not statistically significant
5626713 in conclusion we feel that the current evidence suggests that gum chewing following abdominal surgery offers significant benefits in reducing the time to resolution of ileus
5626714 what we now need to see from pakistan is political stability and thats very important because in the pakistan afghanistan area is where in our view the current hot bed of international terrorism is he told sydney radio 2gb
5626715 weve got over 1000 troops in afghanistan in oruzgan province in areas abutting the pakistan afghanistan border regions so it has very important consequences for the safety of our troops there he added
5626716 i want to make a difference and put a smile on the kids faces
5626717 were just giving kids from nova scotia an experience that they never would have in a classroom
5626718 we know the basics like hello and goodbye but we couldnt hold a conversation
5626719 woody plants suck carbon out of the atmosphere as they grow
5626720 but they get beaten back pretty severely by large animals
5626721 as soon as you kick an ecosystem its difficult to know exactly how it will respond but biological systems are poorly represented in climate models anything that improves the accuracy is positive
5626722 you could hear her going on and on because she was standing right behind the stage curtain
5626723 shes talking and talking meanwhile you have the entire audience waiting almost two hours for the taping to start
5626724 she leaves us waiting and everyone is sitting there complaining and then she comes out and doesnt say a word about it she didnt even say hello she got right into her script
5626725 tyra kept saying when i was a model and would hardly let them talk it was all about her as usual
5626726 she had the audience prance down the street and then release black balloons some were whining that it was so bad for the environment
5626727 it was so disorganized people fell over the press outside and almost trampled two little girls tyra was acting like it was a live sporting event instead of the most self indulgent narcissistic crap
5626728 we are a religiously pluralistic state there are many kinds of people who have to live together in california and i think the court framed this decision to make crystal clear that all patients must receive equal services regardless of the reason that an individual health care practitioner might have for wanting to turn people away
5626729 do the rights of religious freedom and free speech as guaranteed in both the federal and the california constitutions exempt a medical clinics physicians from complying with the california unruh civil rights acts prohibition against discrimination
5626730 californias compelling interest in ensuring full and equal access to medical treatment irrespective of sexual orientation
5626731 this decision may have a big impact on californias proposition 8 the initiative to protect traditional marriage as voters begin to recognize the radical agenda of our opposition
5626732 the ruling is an important one for california and beyond because it stands for the general principle that when you engage in discriminatory conduct in this case the refusal to treat someone in a medical setting based on their sexual orientation you cant claim that conduct has first amendment protection
5626733 you are a business and as a business non discrimination laws apply to you the same way they apply to any business
5626734 this just adds fuel to that fire and underscores the urgency for cultural conservatives at winning where they can win
5626735 in facing the problems and challenges before us we always have to be rational and have a realistic awareness of our own capabilities
5626736 at the time the military chief and i went to the ambalat waters and there i said if people want to go to war alright let s go to war but is it really the best possible way out what about the cost benefit of a war
5626737 the basic objectives of our diplomacy are sovereignty integrity prosperity and our active role in international relations
5626738 continuing worries about a u s economy slowdown which may spread to the euro zone and perhaps also asia are weighing down on oil pricing
5626739 in the near term there will be a lot of downward pressure but i dont foresee a fast collapse of pricing to 100 dollars a barrel or below there is still strong support at 110 a barrel level because of supply side issues
5626740 if you put together a big wave with small children you get disaster
5626741 so it was really important to have this piece of legislation to regulate the wave pools
5626742 the question before us then becomes at what point do you expect people to exercise a motive of parental responsibility and common sense when going to a water park where the chief object of said water park is to enjoy the waves that it generates

5626744 its frustrating ive missed a lot of football since the munster final my fitness is not as good as it should be
5626745 it his hamstring recovery is coming on fairly okay but until i test it if i test it too soon i will be gone for the game
5626746 i have only done 10 or 15 minutes the last couple of nights
5626747 the squad is as strong as weve had on paper
5626748 we just have to replicate the paper and make sure we put on a performance
5626749 the one thing we have got is that everyone in this squad is fighting for their place its not a foregone conclusion who plays in the first xi thats credit to the players theyve created that pressure
5626750 the players know that if they do well enough my recommendation will go straight to fabio
5626751 i think you just have those games where you feel like youre hitting the ball well
5626752 at the moment i feel like im striking the ball as good as i have ever have
5626753 stats are irrelevant the biggest thing is if the teams going well then im happy
5626754 i dont think i played a game healthy last season i was at about 50 or 60 at best
5626755 when i had another scan on the knee this summer it had not improved so i came back early to try to fix it at the beginning of pre season
5626756 whether i am fit for portsmouth or the match after that the most important thing is i am healthy for the rest of the season
5626757 i have not even come close to fulfilling my potential yet and providing i stay healthy this could be a really big season for me
5626758 let there be no doubt these are dangerous individuals they were in possession of material that was operationally useful to anyone wishing to carry out an act of violence or terrorism
5626759 if you can find a big target and take it out like a military base in the uk then praise be to allah
5626760 agents should know when to ask for advice from their local police having a relationship with the local police is just as important as international policing is
5626761 los angeles a theft suspect and an officer were taken to hospitals monday as a barricade ended inside an office at a wal mart store at baldwin hills crenshaw plaza
5626762 this week ill be delving into wal mart stores inc
5626763 you both print out your credit reports bring them to dinner and share them
5626764 i regularly hear from readers that they married someone they found out afterwards had tens of thousands of dollars in debt
5626765 your credit reports never co mingle you always maintain your own credit report your scores will never bleed over
5626766 technically you can keep your finances separate and your scores separate but if you are dealing with a bad credit scores it will affect your life
5626767 its harder to get out of a co signed loan than it is to get out of a marriage
5626768 the stunning part is the horrible advice some people get
5626769 for someone to go through a divorce and leave an account open is amazing youre paying a lawyer a lot for advice and they should know better
5626770 and actually pulling a credit report is really a neutral thing in black and white
5626771 say hey how funny would it be to compare our credit scores
5626772 youve got to get off your high horse a little bit keep in mind that the goal is not to make the other person feel bad its to make sure your financial life is as harmonious as possible
5626773 you dont want any surprises that could threaten the relationship later
5626774 first discuss commitment then this should be your next discussion
5626775 senator obama does not support re imposing the fairness doctrine on broadcasters
5626776 he considers this debate to be a distraction from the conversation we should be having about opening up the airwaves and modern communications to as many diverse viewpoints as possible that is why sen obama supports media ownership caps network neutrality public broadcasting as well as increasing minority ownership of broadcasting and print outlets
5626777 broadcasters must give adequate coverage to public issues and this coverage must accurately reflect opposing views on the issue
5626778 our massive strategy was to use the fairness doctrine to challenge and harass right wing broadcasters and hope the challenges would be so costly to them that they would be inhibited and decide it was too expensive to continue
5626779 as often happens this particular initiative had exactly the opposite effect from what the fcc intended over the years station owners grew so wary of attracting the scrutiny of federal regulators that they largely banned discussion of political issues on the air and mandatory public service programming was deliberately anodyne
5626780 all that changed once the fcc dropped the fairness doctrine in 1987 a half century of pent up free speech was suddenly liberated and talk radio came into its own
5626781 i dont need to be balanced with equal time because i am equal time
5626782 by insisting on so called balance liberals want to silence those they dont agree with they know they cannot prevail in the public debate of ideas
5626783 i think we may only have about two years left for me to be able to be in the radio business
5626784 nothing less than a sweeping takeover by washington bureaucrats of broadcast media and it is designed to squelch conservative speech on the airwaves
5626785 they said weve got to do something about this these are nothing but far right wing extremists theres got to be a legislative fix for this
5626786 i think the fairness doctrine ought to be there and i also think equal time doctrine ought to come back these are the people that wiped out one of the most profound changes in the balance of the media is when the conservatives got rid of the equal time requirements and the result is that they have been able to squeeze down and squeeze out opinion of opposing views and i think its been a very important transition in the imbalance of our public eye
5626787 then immediately afterwards rush limbaugh and other hate mongers began to fill the airwaves
5626788 congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press
5626789 he considers this debate to be a distraction from the conversation we should be having about opening up the airwaves and modern communications to as many diverse viewpoints as possible that is why sen obama supports media ownership caps network neutrality public broadcasting as well as increasing minority ownership of broadcasting and print outlets
5626790 the new york times provides a glimpse of the fairness doctrine
5626791 it is not conservatives who having lost in the talk radio marketplace of ideas are pushing to re institute the fairness doctrine to suppress political viewpoints they find objectionable and it is not conservative newspaper editors who masquerading as objective high minded journalists exhibit the stunning audacity to refuse publication of an op ed by the presidential candidate they oppose after having published one from the one they endorse
5626792 david shipley the times op ed editor sent an e mail to mccains staff rejecting the piece and offering suggestions on how to tailor it for resubmission im not going to be able to accept this piece as currently written let me suggest an approach
5626793 the left supports campaign finance reform the fairness doctrine and other policies allegedly aimed at ensuring that both sides of the political argument be aired but its a colossal fraud
5626794 the times rejection of mccains piece is a case study in how liberals apply these principles they dont believe in both sides presenting their viewpoints but in controlling the nature and scope of the discussion
5626795 can you imagine what would be in store for political speech in this country if liberals resumed regulatory control of the airways
5626796 found that 49 of voters believe most reporters will try to help the democrat with their coverage
5626797 analysis of federal records shows that the amount of money journalists contributed so far this election cycle favors democrats by a 15 1 ratio over republicans with 225 563 going to democrats only 16 298 to republicans

5626823 it should be among our top priorities to provide our students with the tools they need to maintain and build upon this standing
5626824 american businesses know that they need a well educated workforce to face growing competition from china india and europe
5626825 the creativity that developed extraordinary new information technologies has not focused on finding ways to make learning more compelling more personal and more productive in our nations schools
5626826 people assumed that the explosion of innovation in information tools in business and service industries would automatically move into classrooms
5626827 education is falling further and further behind the rest of the economy and we have to rethink our basic approach to helping people learn
5626828 vexing demands of educational software has not been economically viable
5626829 todays generation is very comfortable with using tools like ipods and computers and gaming but when they go into the classroom none of that is there and there is this sense of an opportunity we are just not grasping

5626832 commodities the stuff that feeds us runs our cars heats our homes and provides the basic materials of everyday life recently enjoyed one of the great bull runs of modern investment history nearly doubling in price in the space of a year
5626833 the recent bull run in commodities was based more on investment demand than the fundamentals of the world economy

5626837 we have agreed a fee with newcastle for shola and he spent yesterday monday at the club having a medical
5626838 it would be easy to give in and let inflation get out of control thats what happened in the 1970s but it would be damaging and dangerous to the economy
5626839 all being well inflation will fall again next year and will be much closer to the two per cent target by the end of 2009 but that will only happen if people dont chase inflationary wage increases
5626840 everyone wants to protect their living standard but if everyone does it prices will just go up again as businesses try to cover their higher costs then well all be back to square one but with inflation still high
5626841 stephen has really shown his true worth to the team this season and is undoubtedly one the leading batsmen in the country
5626842 he and daryl mitchell are fast becoming one of the most reliable opening partnerships in the county championship and i am pleased we will see this partnership develop over the next few years
5626843 i know that stephen has aspirations to play for england and it is well known how committed we are to developing players for england
5626844 i am really pleased to continue my career with worcestershire i am looking forward to taking the field with the current squad of talented players and competing for trophies and championships in the future
5626845 jt and rio are both well respected by the team

5626847 there are a lot of good english managers around but at the moment there isnt one who has been there and done it
5626848 the lads are behind him because of his reputation you realise his pedigree and what he has done in the game
5626849 we have to get behind him and support him because he is a tremendous force and is of tremendous importance for the team you want your own fans to be behind him
5626850 what happened in the transfer period did not always reflect his deep desire and there was manipulation from agents on both sides but overall i am positive he will recover

5626921 at the time it was raining in the village quite cold and the conditions were every difficult
5626922 the village community and local government had done a lot to try to find him but they had been unable to locate him
5626923 when they found him his condition wasnt good he was very weak and sick and obviously cold because he had been exposed to the cool weather over the last few days
5626924 we will be looking at different ways to support the community particularly the office in terms of possibly putting up signs or providing training to the local guides to thank them for all their help
5626925 we feel deep gratitude to the local villagers and authorities that assisted us
5626926 after hearing extensive argument i have come to the conclusion that as a matter of law the evidence as it stands could not support a verdict of guilty in relation to either ms pace or mr conduit
5626927 i do formally direct that you must reach a verdict of not guilty in relation to both of the accused
5626928 i cant believe they were negligent in not taking him to the hospital i just cant understand that and i just cant understand why they let them go for that
5626929 just that someone can be so helpless and that they can not care for him
5626930 after anxious consideration in my opinion i should uphold the application on behalf of the accused and direct the jury to bring in verdicts of not guilty

5626940 clean coal renewables and yellowcake we must include nuclear in our future baseload clean energy mix
5626941 burying mere tonnes of radioactive waste in geological stable rock
5626942 our view is that there needs to be consideration in australia given to the development of a nuclear power industry
5626943 we need more rational discussion about nuclear power in australia and much less of the emotive political debate weve had in the last few years
5626944 we cannot envisage any circumstance under which australia will have a nuclear power industry
5626945 the last election showed that australians are absolutely of one mind about not having 25 nuclear power plants dotted around their suburbs and in and around their cities
5626946 are they really saying that they have a plan for 25 nuclear reactors in australia where are they going to put them
5626947 australia has an abundance of renewable energy sources we have a lot of solar we have a lot of wind we have geothermal resources
5626948 we dont believe its appropriate for australia to go down the nuclear path
5626949 cyber bullying is not under any definition trespass or theft

5626964 liu xiang had been trying his best after he arrived in the warmup area
5626965 three doctors were on the spot helping him deal with the pain but whatever measure was taken it was useless no matter if it was sprayed or iced it turned out to be useless because the injury is on the heel which takes the most force whenever he stood up he fell down
5626966 i dont think he knew how serious it was until he got out there and put himself in prerace full warmup mode
5626967 i had heard nothing about this and they dont keep secrets from me about things like this
5626968 we hope he will take proper rest and focus on his recovery
5626969 we hope that after he recovers he will continue to train hard and struggle harder for the national glory
5626970 four years after athens his main goal was gold in beijing
5626971 todays result is not perfect especially for liu xiang there is a great expectation and a great pressure from all
5626972 for the past four years liu xiang has been an athlete with great perseverance and stability who never drops out of competition easily he went into the stadium with the greatest and strongest will he wanted to compete but he could not ignore the pain he was suffering liu xiang would not have withdrawn unless the pain was intolerable and he had no other way out
5626973 he has taken effective measures and made adjustments and until last saturday he was in great shape
5626974 after experts and doctors looked at it his injury eased and he was still very confident even though there was pain he exercised to his best to 100 percent so he decided to compete after treatment from doctors
5626975 it makes a huge difference when there is pain some actions are not easy but he was very determined to compete
5626976 he stands the pressure no other athletes can simply stand everybody expected that liu can do as well as he did four years ago in athens and get another gold medal thats the wishes of all chinese people
5626977 i believe that all the chinese people will understand his situation and encourage him to overcome this problem and come back to the track and run good performance again

5626988 nature has developed all of this firepower for getting things into cells and one of the ways is to create entities that are arginine rich
5626989 arginine rich sequences appear to figure in the mechanisms by which many pathogens invade cells
5626990 its an exciting result to be able to take a drug known to work against cancer but stymied by resistant cells and restore it to effectiveness using an arginine transporter
5626991 this bodes well for use with other drugs that succumb to resistance
5626992 if we think of the pump as being a bouncer for the cellular club then effectively what were doing is disguising one of these therapeutic agents to get it in through the back door or the side door
5626993 as the transporter with all these arginine guanidinium groups approaches the cell it basically does a handshake using hydrogen bonds with cell surface constituents that are in the membrane
5626994 in essence it changes its physical properties by shaking hands with all these cell membrane components
5626995 postoperative ileus inability of the intestines to pass contents is regarded as an inevitable response to the trauma of abdominal surgery and is a major contributing factor to postoperative pain and discomfort associated with abdominal distension nausea vomiting and cramping pain
5626996 postoperative length of hospital stay was assessed in four trials comprising 134 patients
5626997 this was also reduced in the chewing gum group by longer than one day however this result was not statistically significant
5626998 in conclusion we feel that the current evidence suggests that gum chewing following abdominal surgery offers significant benefits in reducing the time to resolution of ileus

5627044 hard to believe you can find this quality of thai in downtown small town fairfax but its true
5627045 rimango esterrefatto gli autori di tale gesto non si possono nascondere dietro al fatto di essere presunti tifosi giallorossi ma devono essere identificati per quello che sono e cio dei teppisti sono vicino come uomo e come presidente del lecce ad antonio conte e credo di interpretare il pensiero di gran parte dei cittadini leccesi che nulla hanno a che spartire con chi si reso protagonista di questo vergognoso atto di violenza
5627046 i recently had a chance to tour this facility and meet a number of the trainers here
5627047 if you drive away ill come find you i saw how fast you backed out of that spot
5627048 at least when your foot flinched it didnt end up on the gas like mine did
5627049 this guy is great when i went on a date with him he was welcoming and hung like a horse no seriously it was humongous he is definitely one of the cute charming hung like a horse guys in the city i would love to come on him for sure
5627050 this is one of my favorite places for a quick lunch in oakland
5627051 im sorry i ordered the eggplant clay pot not the alpo clay pot
5627052 he wasnt eating he was losing weight coughing at the end of july we took him to the doctor his words were ill be all right ill be all right
5627053 he was a wonderful person and a good friend of mine
5627054 his death was a surprise to me as i was unaware of his illness my condolences to his family he will be missed
5627055 i am extremely proud of the example he set in his music the spinners music was clean
5627056 what comforts me is he is one person who lived his life exactly the way he wanted to
5627057 absolutely 100 per cent clear and clean it did not spread they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer
5627058 i was just shaking and and then also immediately i had to go into
5627059 immediately made those appointments and immediately called around for someone to start teaching me how to live macrobiotically
5627060 everyone has worked at full capacity to get this season out
5627061 and this brilliant but little known play is a delight as well as a challenge
5627062 a wonderful show but i havent done series television since
5627063 i did i feel a little stupid that i hadnt watched the show prior to meeting with them in new york
5627064 but im happy to say the episodes they sent me to look at after were really really engaging and really wonderful and kind of dark and moody like a lot of the work ive been involved in
5627065 were a show that spends a lot of time thinking we dont blow stuff up were not about chasing people down and shooting them the quality that we were looking for was deep intelligence and if you look at mr fishburnes work hes always brought that sensibility to the material hes done
5627066 the character that were creating has a background as a medical doctor a research pathologist in fact and for a number of reasons that will be revealed over the course of the season we will find out that hes been forced out of that career and has become a college lecturer hes teaching a course in criminalistics when he gets involved in a csi investigation
5627067 our professor joining the cast does not negate the fact there may be some promotions from within involving our other csis
5627068 were all back slapping each other when this looked like it was actually going to work out naren and i spoke to each and every member of our cast and i have rarely seen them as excited they just cant wait till mr fishburne walks on that set and they get to collaborate and act with him
5627069 ive just finished doing a one man show on broadway thurgood which has been 145 performances in five or six months and thats good training with respect to what im about to enter into and the speed at which you have to work when youre doing network series television its not unlike being in a repertory company
5627070 its limiting to call me a comedian but it doesnt happen too often now
5627071 i dont see myself as either a comedian or an actor
5627072 i dont think of myself as anything i like writing i like being creative and i like being involved in the conception of things i also just like being an actor sometimes because it resolves me of the responsibility and i can just think about one thing
5627073 the fact that im not known in america is a huge advantage to me i havent been typecast so the type of work that ive been offered is the kind of work i would never be offered in britain
5627074 i dont think dana marschz is aware of the audience hes blissfully unaware and hes got a degree of vulnerability about him an innocence that the others ive done dont have ive tended in the past to play more unpleasant people than this character
5627075 i dont especially like it its just different anything thats different and i havent done before attracts me there are natural creative questions i ask myself whenever a job comes along oh ive not done that can i do it will i be able to will i screw up you have to strike a balance between a job being about miscasting yourself as something youre totally inappropriate for and just doing the same thing all the time
5627076 who gave us that name i dont know anything about that it never came from us
5627077 fine whatever people say but its a good band both of these guys ive known since they were very young and theyre very good bass players and they can back up whatever reputations they have
5627078 theres a certain bit of magic thats attached to this project ive never been out on tour with two other bass players
5627079 at the end of it the editor of bass player magazine said why dont you guys play a song together there were some musicians up on the stage and we all grabbed some basses and played a song that i wrote and for some reason we just sounded like we shouldve been playing together everybody was playing in the right register on the instrument nobody was stepping on anyone else someone took a video of it that went on youtube and it got over a million hits its kind of fascinating to see three bass players it just sounds better than it should its a testament to great musicianship and just being smart as players
5627080 i live by a certain code in the music universe the three ps practice practice and practice usually musicians that are respected heavily by other musicians have that kind of code someone thats really gotten their stuff together and other people see it its very difficult to just wake up or come out of your mothers womb and just play great
5627081 when you play with three guys you have to figure out whats really you cause theres a lot of things that i do that stanley clarke does or that victor does he said
5627082 so you try to find the thing that really sets you apart it really makes you take a good hard look at yourself
5627083 i like to be down in the basement holding things down and being kind of nasty funky thats the space that ive been finding myself filling with this group stanley likes to play high these days he plays tenor bass which is pitched a little higher so i try to stay out of his way and victor his sound is really nice in that mid range we default into that of course we switch roles because we dont want to lock each other in all the time
5627084 i hate to say that i created it because im sure there was someone somewhere doing it
5627085 but it wasnt something that was taught to me it was born out of sounds i heard in my head even though i was a bass player i listened a lot to drummers and i wanted my bass to sound like a drummer to be able to play those fast runs and have the power because i heard the sound the technique showed up on its own over the years i became more popular and people started asking me to write articles and to teach workshops and i named some of the techniques
5627086 i didnt want to write a manual a lot of times theyre kind of sterile and more than that it becomes the authors definitive view
5627087 i dont want to tell anyone how to play the music i want to show them
5627088 for the past several months we have been working closely with neversoft and activision harmonix and konami to ensure that playstation 3 guitars and drum sets will all feature a basic level of gameplay compatibility
5627089 for the most part this means that the titles with musical peripherals will work with the others software a few specific examples include guitar hero world tours guitars and drums will work with rock band 2 and konamis rock revolution software
5627090 and yes you guessed it rock band 2s guitar and drum set will work with guitar hero world tour and with rock revolution
5627091 i think the youth from 12 to 18 are kind of lost they dont know their place in the tribe
5627092 we need more we need more guidance we need more activities out there that will keep kids involved
5627093 we need a recreation area around here where kids can play basketball
5627094 kids drop out of school and dont finish their education
5627095 i think my daughter tried a little too hard to try to fit in she was an impressionable age
5627096 that seems to be like a normal thing on the reservation like drugs and alcohol and she was exposed to it more and i dont know that she knew how to handle it
5627097 we have a long waiting list of people waiting to go to treatment
5627098 we also have consumer advocacy and public policy divisions which is how we attain our nonprofit status and im not involved there
5627099 as a business were not that different from other publishers except we dont take advertisements
5627100 we are moving into mobile applications so you can get information right on your cell phone
5627101 people are aware of consumer reports but few people realize how innovative we are we were actually using the internet as early as 1978
5627102 people are always hunting for bargains and looking for information on consumer purchases
5627103 weve been fortunate to defy publishing industry trends but weve worked hard to refresh and improve our design and presentation
5627104 theres a growing need for user reviews and user generated content and weve been adding more and more but weve actually done that since we started in 1936 generating user reviews with customers surveys through our subscription department
5627105 weve also started to provide more shopping applications through the web service where you can go from the site to make a purchase although that is a service we dont make any money off of that
5627106 takes about an hour and 15 minutes we moved to morristown when i went to work for at amp t in 1980 and we liked it and stayed in the area ever since
5627107 we have a house on the jersey shore in ocean city were beach people in the winter we try to find a warm place in the caribbean
5627108 cyber bullying is not under any definition trespass or theft
5627109 cyber bullying is a relatively new phenomenon as is social networking
5627110 it is therefore not surprising that there have been relatively few prosecutions in this area
5627111 as a tool to address all manner of cyber crimes
5627112 moreover the vehicle for the cyber bullying at issue here a social only became mainstream after 2000
5627113 invites a host of difficult thorny problems and unwanted results
5627114 estamos asumiendo la producci n con los mismos trabajadores de la empresa y los mismos cuadros supervisores

5627118 most anybody when they leave their country their first choice would be to go back home if they could
5627119 if you look at these groups coming here theyre among the most unlikely to go back and those having the most trouble
5627120 the sharks have a bye in the domestic absa currie cup competition this coming weekend and seeing that ruan has been part of the squad for the greater part of this season we thought it would make sense for us to involve him again
5627121 its a black and white answer or should i say a black green and yellow answer
5627122 clean coal renewables and yellowcake we must include nuclear in our future baseload clean energy mix
5627123 burying mere tonnes of radioactive waste in geological stable rock
5627124 our view is that there needs to be consideration in australia given to the development of a nuclear power industry
5627125 we need more rational discussion about nuclear power in australia and much less of the emotive political debate weve had in the last few years
5627126 we cannot envisage any circumstance under which australia will have a nuclear power industry
5627127 the last election showed that australians are absolutely of one mind about not having 25 nuclear power plants dotted around their suburbs and in and around their cities
5627128 are they really saying that they have a plan for 25 nuclear reactors in australia where are they going to put them
5627129 australia has an abundance of renewable energy sources we have a lot of solar we have a lot of wind we have geothermal resources
5627130 tom is the third ruckman on our list so he is going to come into the team and play this week
5627131 he is quite solidly built but he is a development player
5627132 hes going to get a chance to ruck against a really good ruckman in ben hudson and will minson does a little bit so its a great opportunity and he is going to have come ready to play
5627133 we have 24 players available for selection this week which is just the way it is
5627134 they are the cards youre dealt and the 22 that run out have to represent the club well on friday night
5627135 andy comes to us with considerable premier league experience for a player of his age
5627136 he is our sixth signing of the summer and another valuable addition to tony pulis squad
5627137 after hearing extensive argument i have come to the conclusion that as a matter of law the evidence as it stands could not support a verdict of guilty in relation to either ms pace or mr conduit
5627138 i do formally direct that you must reach a verdict of not guilty in relation to both of the accused
5627139 i cant believe they were negligent in not taking him to the hospital i just cant understand that and i just cant understand why they let them go for that
5627140 just that someone can be so helpless and that they can not care for him
5627141 hes always full of advice not only with goalkeeping but in life in general
5627142 at the time it was raining in the village quite cold and the conditions were every difficult
5627143 the village community and local government had done a lot to try to find him but they had been unable to locate him
5627144 when they found him his condition wasnt good he was very weak and sick and obviously cold because he had been exposed to the cool weather over the last few days
5627145 we will be looking at different ways to support the community particularly the office in terms of possibly putting up signs or providing training to the local guides to thank them for all their help
5627146 it is very disappointing for the santa barbara airport to lose skycap service
5627147 mike and his team have provided quality services for many years they will be greatly missed
5627148 i always have to abide by the court rules on what may be potentially prejudicial to the jury
5627149 right after he was stabbed he went down on the ground in the bushes
5627150 in this type of case witnesses who have gang affiliation have less than succinct memories of what transpired
5627151 in gang cases memories are almost never in existence by the time a gang member or gang associate is called to testify
5627152 my sense is that what happened in 1970 has kind of devolved into the bank burning
5627153 but it wasnt something that just happened one night when the bank building burned down it was a repeated message and i think the community finally got together
5627154 if you call someone a pig they may begin to act like one
5627155 i had a press pass it didnt help much for flying tear gas
5627156 what shocked me the most is that police were willing to brutalize people to protect property
5627157 theyd never seen anything like this before they felt like they were under siege and frankly they were under siege
5627158 it was a situation so intense you couldnt believe it
5627159 fear fear of drug addicts the out of control students the atmosphere
5627160 it was indiscriminate the closest cousin to fear is anger
5627161 i saw some of my old fogey colleagues were taking no notice of a world that was changing
5627162 we were able to get the information while it was still hot
5627163 the campus by the sea where the bank burned down
5627164 somehow all the leaders of these radical movements on campus according to these indictments banded together to burn the bank building
5627165 it was entirely peaceful and the police went completely out of control
5627166 i believe very strongly that a group of people who are committed to a cause can bring about change
5627167 those events that spiraled out of control in 1970 brought about great changes in santa barbara
5627168 there is a little corner that honors peace and nonviolence
5627169 normally its a five year wait for this kind of event
5627170 but one of my assistant scoutmasters was a classmate of greg at cal poly they kept in touch and anticipated doing this
5627171 contact between ucsb and the iss will be made possible through the use of a ham radio antenna
5627172 the antenna will relay our signal to the iss and follow its movement in the sky for the duration of the conversation well be pushing 100 hertz with our equipment
5627173 most of the astronauts were scouts in the past and even ham operators
5627174 this experience will give the kids a taste for astrophysics and also offer them a chance to earn a merit badge for radio communication
5627175 questions for greg were submitted a week ago so that the scouts questions could be answered promptly
5627176 they will still be asking questions directly to the astronaut it will have a better effect if it is staged for the kids we are trying to make sure that everyone has a positive experience

5627190 sterling became very uncooperative to the point that he would not even give the police his date of birth
5627191 after the initial contact with sterling by the police sterling went inside the house and he was seen washing off a knife and putting it away in a drawer
5627192 the motive for the stabbing is unknown and the investigation is continuing
5627193 did a bit of scouting for the men at the pru filming wont start til next may or june but locations can really inspire ive also been reading books about my home town of reading thats where the hq of the prudential building society was in the 70s
5627194 this is a milestone event for the republic of somalia forming somalia petroleum corporation not only provides a firm and transparent basis for developing the oil and gas industry in somalia but it in addition it enables the ministry of energy and mining to tap into the natural resources of the country to generate revenue for its people thereby eradicating the prevailing poverty and eliminating the prevailing instability
5627195 medco is proud to have been the pioneer along with its partner kuwait energy company and a catalyst for building the foundations of the oil industry in somalia the oil and gas industry could prove to be a significant source of income for the government while directly or indirectly reducing unemployment in the years to come leading to the establishment of local somali service companies we look forward to building our relationship in somalia
5627196 when looking at the evidence against hammaad munshi i was satisfied there was enough for a case to go to court and that it was in the public interest despite his young age
5627197 the prosecution told the jury of his dedication to the cause of al qaeda and of discussions with aabid khan which included how he could travel abroad and smuggle a sword with him
5627198 etter min mening den beste bloggen om norsk politikk punktum
5627199 i put it in all the separate heat gun but nobody responded
5627200 its now or never if we cant qualify for the world cup now then were never going to get it done
5627201 but by the end of the session the ball was buzzing around
5627202 obviously toronto has a massive jamaican population we just hope that canadian fans are the louder of the bunch
5627203 there is no doubt that the israeli regime and people are both against islam and muslims occupying their lands so how could we speak of friendship with them
5627204 why should people who think like that be one of the presidents colleagues
5627205 i have said before that we do not have any hostility against the israeli people and i still say the same thing proudly
5627206 if a lactating female with a calf goes past and this calf approaches that animal it may accept it but its a very slim chance
5627207 there is no deal with the president and he had himself resigned
5627208 now this whole musharraf excuse is behind us now people are going to be focusing on their performance
5627209 we are very close to deciding to send the prime minister for the closing ceremony of the olympics to be participated by many foreign dignitaries
5627210 we assure you that we will do our best to be the voice of africa along with african nations on the security council
5627211 they want to show nothing is safe here if it isnt under their control
5627212 the goal is to create an economic and humanitarian disaster that will rebound on the government
5627213 the russians deliberately targeted commercial operations to inflict economic damage on georgia
5627214 dropping bombs on poti port killing people i dont see how you can connect that with south ossetia
5627215 the russians want to show that they are lords of the caucasus
5627216 being in a war zone wasnt part of the job description
5627217 he said if any of you touch a hair on any of my soldiers heads well flatten the whole town
5627218 they cleaned out a store we used for old clothes used underwear old socks
5627219 they also took a black and white tv set and some tins of motor oil
5627220 while negotiations on a government of national unity are continuing it may be necessary to convene parliament to give effect to the will of the people as expressed in the parliamentary elections held on 29 march
5627221 we hope that no one would do anything to breach the memorandum of understanding on the talks
5627222 we dont have consensus to reconvene parliament how do you reconvene parliament with an illegitimate government
5627223 the zimbabwean issue is far from resolved and so the continent as a whole has a responsibility to continue to engage with us in finding solutions
5627224 part of it is actually a process of trying to unlock the deadlocks that have emerged in the negotiations
5627225 in the end he also became the man who couldnt deliver bush was very slow to realize that he either had been had by musharraf or that musharraf was not up to the task historians will debate this for years
5627226 the new pakistani general hes just been elected not elected this guy took over office
5627227 it wasnt a personal relationship but musharraf tried to play it effectively for domestic advantage
5627228 we pretty much played the musharraf card ad nauseam eventually to pakistans detriment
5627229 so far ive found him to be a man of his word
5627230 the fundamental question i have for president musharraf is will these elections be under emergency rule or law because if they are its going to be hard for well itll be hard for those of us who have belief that hes advanced pakistans democracy to say thats thats still the case
5627231 president bush and vice president cheney backed a discredited dictator which has undercut our ability to work with the new government to eliminate the terrorist sanctuary that has re emerged in pakistans tribal areas
5627232 president musharraf took his country a long way in turning it back from the extremism that was starting to characterize it at the time of sept 11 2001 he also kept his promise to try and help a transition to free and fair elections we didnt agree with everything he did especially the state of emergency but he did take off the military uniform the elections were free and fair
5627233 he tried to play both ends moving against certain terrorist targets but more broadly letting the terrorists increase their influence in his own country he campaigned for democratic reform then staged faulty elections to help himself stay in power

5627238 we in the south pacific and pacific island countries in particular take democracy very seriously that is why we believe we cannot sit idly by while the principles of democracy are shredded we look forward to the discussion that will now occur minus fiji in niue on how this matter should be handled in future
5627239 i think that it is absolutely regrettable that the leader of fiji has decided not to attend the forum it would have been far better for the leader of fiji to sit down with the leaders of the pacific island countries and answer for the commitments that have been previously given by fiji to fellow island states
5627240 if someone is not prepared to come and be accountable for breaking commitments given to leaders a year ago that in itself speaks volumes so i expect that there will be a robust outcome from the forum
5627241 there is no reasonable excuse at all for fiji not attending the pacific forum i personally intervened to ensure transit visas were available for the fiji delegation to go through auckland airport to niue so they could be accountable to the forum leaders for commitments given last year

5627245 according to the study the median net worth of hispanic households in 2002 was 7 932
5627246 the wealthiest 25 percent of hispanic and non hispanic black households own 93 percent of the total wealth of each group among non hispanic white households the top 25 percent own 79 percent of total wealth
5627247 in 2050 the nations population of children is expected to be 62 percent minority up from 44 percent today thirty nine percent are projected to be hispanic up from 22 percent in 2008 and 38 percent are projected to be single race non hispanic white down from 56 percent in 2008
5627248 it was a moment i had dreamed of so many times in my head during the race i told myself boy be greedy its champagne or fizzy water

5627259 after oil plumbed new lows at the end of last week storm fay caused a recovery in prices

5627262 it is hard to see through the fog of this war another pipeline through georgia

5627271 doctors dont always agree on a prognosis there is a fair amount of objectivity and there is a certain amount of subjectivity
5627272 as a result of this recommendation it appears that dr rainville would not sign paperwork to support a total and permanent disability claim
5627273 it appears at this point that dc district chief famolare begins to doctor shop
5627274 following that appointment dr mahoney then signs off on dc famolares paperwork declaring him totally disabled

5627288 we found that mosquitoes can smell deet and they stay away from it
5627289 deet doesnt mask the smell of the host or jam the insects senses mosquitoes dont like it because it smells bad to them
5627290 for decades we were told that deet warded off mosquito bites because it blocked insect response to lactic acid from the host the key stimulus for blood feeding
5627291 dr leal and co workers escaped the key stimulus over simplification to show that mosquito responses like our own result from a balancing of various positive and negative factors all impinging on a tiny brain more capable than most people think of sophisticated decision making
5627292 one of the great attributes of science is that over time it is self correcting
5627293 i was so delighted when i first encountered the neuron that detects deet a synthetic compound
5627294 i couldnt believe my eyes because it goes against conventional wisdom so i repeated the experiment over and over until we discussed the findings in the lab
5627295 despite the fact that deet is the industry standard mosquito repellent relatively little is known about how it actually works
5627296 previous studies have suggested a masking or binding with host emanations understanding the mode of action is especially important because deet is used as the standard against which all other tentative replacement repellents are compared
5627297 he left our prison early this morning tuesday and he is now already far from here

5627299 a shiite salesman was fatally wounded in an attack at a grocery store and was brought to the citys district hospital when there was a blast in the emergency ward
5627300 the bodies are being evacuated the dead included civilians and policemen it is not clear if the blast was a suicide attack
5627301 free radicals from tobacco smoke have long been suspected of having extremely harmful effects on the body
5627302 based on our work we now know that free radicals similar to those in cigarettes are also found in airborne fine particles and potentially can cause many of the same life threatening conditions this is a staggering but not unbelievable result when one considers all of diseases in the world that cannot currently be attributed to a specific origin
5627303 you basically have to be in certain places to inhale transient gas phase radicals
5627304 youd have to be right next to a road when a car passes for example whereas we found that persistent radicals can last indefinitely on airborne fine particles so youre never going to get away from them
5627305 i dont think theres any justification for payments beyond the ranges that council approves
5627306 whats the point of establishing by ordinance salary ranges if youre not going to follow them
5627307 there is no permanency there is no job security there is no collective bargaining theres no union protection
5627308 we try to be as fair as possible in doing this and coming to a salary that really reflects the work thats being done at the time
5627309 yes theres a public vote but its a very private process
5627310 the central staff of the city council received appropriate cost of living adjustments during the years in which i served as council president
5627311 if you look at the salaries and the work that theyre doing i suggest to you that they are underpaid not overpaid
5627312 were just trying to do the right thing here and i think its critically important that we maintain a stable central staff so that we can create greater opportunities for the people we represent
5627313 if somebody is worth 95 000 in their mind but the range only goes to 85 000 then change the ranges
5627314 clearly the council has the ability to change the ranges based on what he person in that position is worth
5627315 we determine what is going to be better for us it is good people who make the neighborhood
5627316 it is the quickest way to get this mess cleared up
5627317 you need people to buy the property and fix it up and move back its the way the market works its wonders
5627318 more people are buying than i had noticed thats a good thing
5627319 if they fix it and maintain it and contribute to the quality of life of the neighborhood that is fine
5627320 we need more investment in the neighborhood and it is important it happen fast hopefully this is a sign we are now at the bottom and people are starting to buy
5627321 savvy real estate investors have money and now it is a great opportunity for them to buy
5627322 this is what ive been working for all my life and its mine
5627323 these guys should get awards for what they are doing

5627335 traditionally people have tied their software to their hardware virtualization changes all that
5627336 cerebral malaria is lethal 20 percent of the time in the best of hands and here weve shown that something as simple as aspirin because of its affect on platelets might be able to improve the outcomes of those who contract this deadly form of the disease
5627337 the take home lesson is that platelets by releasing pf4 are playing an early role in the wind up phase of cerebral malaria
5627338 our mouse studies show that timing is critical with the mice we know when we infected them and controlled when we treated them
5627339 nature has developed all of this firepower for getting things into cells and one of the ways is to create entities that are arginine rich
5627340 arginine rich sequences appear to figure in the mechanisms by which many pathogens invade cells
5627341 its an exciting result to be able to take a drug known to work against cancer but stymied by resistant cells and restore it to effectiveness using an arginine transporter
5627342 this bodes well for use with other drugs that succumb to resistance
5627343 in essence the technology can be used to overcome one of the most challenging types of problems of drug resistance
5627344 if youre not recognized as being part of the club then youre kicked out
5627345 if we think of the pump as being a bouncer for the cellular club then effectively what were doing is disguising one of these therapeutic agents to get it in through the back door or the side door
5627346 this could potentially be used with any drug which is effective but has a delivery problem
5627347 as the transporter with all these arginine guanidinium groups approaches the cell it basically does a handshake using hydrogen bonds with cell surface constituents that are in the membrane
5627348 in essence it changes its physical properties by shaking hands with all these cell membrane components
5627349 ovarian cancer has a drug taxol that works pretty well in the beginning seventy or eighty percent of the patients have a response
5627350 but it fails at the end because drug resistance develops
5627351 there is certainly a need to improve access to mainstream sexual health services for aboriginal people
5627352 continuing access to effective sexual health service delivery is an essential part of reducing sexually transmissible infections among aboriginal people
5627353 this workshop is an opportunity for workers from mainstream organisations to carefully reflect on how their services are organised and delivered and how they can work better with aboriginal people
5627354 carl woese and his colleagues years ago established that protein translation had to be well developed when the evolution of modern cells started
5627355 so the evolution of cells and the evolution of translation are really linked to one another
5627356 to be a molecular signature a sequence has to be common to all members of a single domain of life but not another
5627357 until the 2000s when these structures became available you werent able to correlate where these signatures were with what was touching them in 3 d space
5627358 so nobody had ever done this sort of analysis before
5627359 the ramifications of this work are it gives you a much better way to probe how this universal machinery changes from one organism to another
5627360 in that the ribosome constitutes the core of the cellular translation mechanism which is the sine qua non of gene expression which is the essence of life as we know it these findings constitute a major step in understanding the evolution of life which is still a journey of a thousand miles

5627364 one wrong is not corrected by another wrong one act of violence is not solved by another violent act
5627365 post abortion trauma in many rape cases appears to be no less pronounced than post abortion trauma in non rape cases rape followed by pregnancy followed by abortion leaves three victims the woman who was traumatized initially by the rape the unborn child who is traumatized by the abortion and for a second time the woman who is traumatized by her decision to have an abortion
5627366 to argue for abortion on demand from the hard cases of rape and incest is like trying to argue for the elimination of traffic laws from the fact that one might have to violate some of them in rare circumstances such as when ones spouse or child needs to be rushed to the hospital
5627367 over the past thirty years we have moved imperceptibly from abortion as an option in extreme circumstances through abortion as an option on request to a duty to abort
5627368 what if you found that your spouse or adopted child was fathered by a rapist would it change your view of their worth would you love them any less if not why should we view the innocent unborn child any differently
5627369 constant experience that disability and unhappiness do not necessarily go together some of the most unhappy children whom i have known have all of the physical and mental faculties and on the other hand some of the happiest youngsters have borne burdens which i myself would find very difficult to bear
5627370 national organisation for parents of handicapped children that is on record as favouring abortion for the handicapped in short it is not the handicapped or their parents who want abortions for those who may be handicapped it is those who are not handicapped but should not the handicapped be allowed to speak for themselves

5627372 i havent had any money yet i think its something to do with royalties but at least i have enough money to buy a pair of tights now

5627377 there is strong support for prices to drift lower towards 100 a barrel we are only about 10 a barrel away and i wont be surprised to see 105 a barrel by next month
5627378 the hurricane season is still a major issue as seen in 2005 with katrina we have to be mindful of that
5627379 nobody seems to be paying too much attention to that crude prices will drift lower at a slow and leisurely pace
5627380 if anything in my life is positive in terms of business simon actually feels a pain in his stomach or his side if were in a restaurant simon will get up and walk outside he doesnt want to hear it he does not want to be around if a good phone call comes in

5627382 we do have some bands feeding into the storm from the south linker said
5627383 it will be these bands rotating into the storm and breaking off that could impact the bay area
5627384 we could see some tropical storm conditions from these bands

5627387 we talked forever until 2 3 4 in the morning about life volleyball boyfriends children friends and family to get to know each other
5627388 we knew the off court relationship could help us on court now i realise that when she yells she doesnt do it to make you feel bad but because she wants the best for you
5627389 trying to find the right chemistry is tough we werent at this level in the first year you have to work through the ups and downs like in a marriage when things dont go your way you dont split up you work at it
5627390 its hard to play together for five years aleksandrs is so different and its hard always to be together
5627391 but back into that playoff round its a second tournament
5627392 its a game a day but a game a day in the olympics feels like four or five
5627393 its not just a mental break physically well make sure we take care of ourselves
5627394 we get the day off to get our heads together to watch as much video as you can
5627395 it was kind of neat because the live stream was on a 10 second delay so as soon as we saw it live we got the instant replay right after
5627396 she is one of the better competitors and really good at focusing when it counts
5627397 in four years time it will depend if she is still healthy and shes still hungry to stay at the top
5627398 as long as she is competing i dont think that is an option
5627399 but i am not pressuring her at all she can take her time
5627400 there has been talk that if the whole team does well they might change their flights and go on a vacation together so ill be holding the fort down here
5627401 at this point its easy to say im going to be disappointed going to the games twice and not being able to medal
5627402 everything gets easier as time passes by so in the future two time olympian will sound pretty cool
5627403 its the last time any of us will probably get to be here even if it does get reinstated
5627404 some big situations came up and i couldnt get the job done
5627405 unfortunately the games for us have been so tight any mistake is magnified
5627406 its going to be a lot better going home 3 4 with four losses in one run games than if we were 1 6 and just threw in the towel
5627407 hes so big and so global now im sure well try to top it marjorie hampson a county spokeswoman said yesterday
5627408 many problems have not been solved not even by the united nations
5627409 and some want them to be solved during the olympic games putting pressure on the olympic committee and the beijing olympic committee
5627410 we think that you do not really understand chinas reality
5627411 china has its own version and way of exercising our democracy
5627412 the rejections arent surprising given the governments antipathy to criticism generally and visible protest in particular
5627413 what is surprising is that 77 applications were even filed in light of the high risks protesters run of arrest harassment and physical harm
5627414 these 77 protest applicants should shame those who say that chinese are content with some different and lower standard of liberty and it should impel apologists for the governments appalling performance to insist that real human rights benchmarks be part of any future olympic hosting
5627415 there is no doubt that the israeli regime and people are both against islam and muslims occupying their lands so how could we speak of friendship with them
5627416 why should people who think like that be one of the presidents colleagues
5627417 i have said before that we do not have any hostility against the israeli people and i still say the same thing proudly
5627418 then they mounted four rows of precious stones on it in the first row there was a ruby a topaz and a beryl in the second row was a turquoise a sapphire and an emerald in the third row a jacinth an agate and an amethyst in the fourth row a chrysolite an onyx and a jasper they were mounted on gold filigree settings there were twelve stones one for each of the names of the sons of israel each engraved like a seal with the name of one of the twelve tribes
5627419 one fifty four is very fast especially for an 18 year old said maria mutola of mozambique the 2000 olympic champion who finished fifth in this race
5627420 im sure she will break the world record when shes 21 or 22 maybe she runs different a very very fast first lap
5627421 it was really nice but it wasnt easy for me to win
5627422 i had to try my best when i crossed the line i saw my friends i was so happy
5627423 its humbling for me and its humbling for kobe bryant 13 points it was unbelievable especially for myself
5627424 hes definitely one of the greatest athletes ive ever seen in my life
5627425 i came to the birds nest to lay a golden egg
5627426 for all we know there is a gay rower or badminton player somewhere known as gay within his or her sport but not in a larger public context
5627427 its humbling for me and its humbling for kobe bryant 13 points it was unbelieveable especially for myself
5627428 hes definitely one of the greatest athletes ive ever seen in my life
5627429 i know a lot of people look up to us as nba basketball players but they dont really know how we look up to them we were definitely appreciative of him to come out
5627430 thats one of the games you have to attend to the simple things you dont want to give up any layups you want to rebound the ball well you want to execute you dont want to mess around and get sloppy in games like that youll just hurt yourself
5627431 was right on my hip and you know we dont have any brakes or gears if you stop pedalling or if you hesitate you get kicked off
5627432 her bike actually went into me and hit me and i had to use some of my former mountain biking skills
5627433 it was a really heated race a fast race i was happy with my strategies and was up there playing in the game
5627434 sometimes you can roll the dice and get the double six like that girl vos who lapped the field but nobody was able to go with her
5627435 i tried to be patient for the first few sprints then get myself into some groups that could possibly lap the field i got into one group that looked promising with some of the big hitters in there but sometimes it works and sometimes it doesnt

5627440 it is perfectly normal and linguistically fascinating but people sometimes find it embarrassing
5627441 they think it is a sign of incompetence when it is really a sign of resiliency and creativity
5627442 i feel moroccan first then canadian second if i dont use arabic first i dont feel true to myself its a way of coping with life here
5627443 it gives you the feeling of a big unlimited space it has an echo it rhymes in your head and stays there
5627444 its not a lesser english its one type of world english
5627445 we cannot write like the english we should not we cannot write only as indians our method of expression therefore has to be a dialect which will some day prove to be as distinctive and colourful as the irish or american
5627446 thats a direct consequence of international scope the fact that english has travelled so far around the world and mixed with so many other cultures and has absorbed influences from all those other cultures it has been an amazingly tolerant language
5627447 some people feel threatened because the standard isnt adhered to across the board
5627448 in a sense it is a true reflection of the 21st century where immigration of groups permanent crossing of national boundaries is one of the constants of our lifestyle the english language has a head start over lots of other languages because it already is so cosmopolitan in its constituents
5627449 were really excited to be playing the myspace secret show in london next week weve been playing some big festivals across europe recently so it will be fun to get intimate with our myspace fans
5627450 anakku seperti itu jualah kehidupanmu meski engkau telah tumbuh tinggi seperti pohon hubungan dan keterikatan dalam pikiranmu perhatianmu dan keinginanmu tertuju pada tanah dan dunia ini seperti itulah tingkatanmu sekarang
5627451 betapa pun banyaknya perhatian dan keterhubunganmu pada dunia ini jika engkau ingin mencari tuhan jika engkau hendak mengarungi jalan menuju tuhan ini maka dirimu seluruh doa dan sujudmu haruslah bak sebuah pohon meski tertancap ke tanah ia menyerahkan buah buahnya kepada semua makhluk meski engkau terhubung ke dunia ini seperti pohon perhatianmu mustilah seperti buah buahan itu doa doamu pengabdianmu ibadah dan sujudmu sifat sifat dan tidakanmu musti terhubung dengan tuhan dan engkau harus melakukan tugas tanpa mementingkan dirimu sendiri yang bermanfaat bagi seluruh kehidupan maka engkau akan selamat dalam perjalanan menuju tuhanmu
5627452 nobody in moscows leadership has an interest in military confrontations
5627453 i dont think that there will be a return to the status quo ante

5627455 i dont think much of demonizing russia i consider russia as part of europe
5627456 you cannot edit the network of a group once it has been created in order for your network specific group to be a global group you must recreate the group
5627457 mentally i feel much better than i did the day before
5627458 i came back to priorities and what to think about at the right moment and it seems to be working out better for me
5627459 in the preliminaries i was doing my best to think about the right things and stay focused on what i had to do but i found it very hard last night was much more easier and my head was right and i was very very focused
5627460 its pretty hard to come down off a high of last night and come into the pool 10 hours later and put in your best

5627463 i said that this was an inquiry that was not needed from the beginning
5627464 it is the second biggest economy in the world and in 50 years it will be the biggest economy in the world
5627465 starting with diefenbaker trudeau and all of us we established very good relations relatively speaking with china and suddenly you break the bridge
5627466 i find it ironic that prime minister chr tien somehow skipped the 94 98 2000 and 2002 opening ceremonies based on his remarks should we conclude that relations with those countries were damaged because prime minister chr tien did not attend four out of five olympic games that took place while he was prime minister
5627467 i was in china and hong kong and i think harper is even less popular there than in canada
5627468 i felt a little stupid and embarrassed that i hadnt watched the show prior to having a meeting with them
5627469 but im happy to say that the episodes that they sent me to look at were really really engaging and really wonderful and kind of dark and moody like a lot of the work that ive actually been involved in

5627473 when we came back from the december break the use of time was not as productive as wed like it to have been
5627474 our real job is helping them become a good citizen
5627475 we will work with the ministry of the environment for cost recovery because the cleanup is their sunrise responsibility
5627476 working with the ministry to recover the money is a top priority
5627477 we are all operating on the assumption they sunrise will say they have empty pockets and we will go after their insurance
5627478 after thorough review it has been determined that the use of the propane distribution centre is permitted in that area
5627479 zoning is permissive and includes permission to sell propane directly to the public
5627480 even if this thing has a right to be there give us the right to fight it at least let the people know thats what angers me the most it was under the radar
5627481 now you get what you want do you want moooore

5627483 activity increases this time of year its very typical we would expect to see more mosquitoes and more mosquito activity because the type of mosquitoes which cause the virus breed more at this time of year
5627484 there are eight positive pools in the gta so that tells us the risk is out there
5627485 can explain more things in more ways than anything else

5627488 za ta nastop sem dal du o dve leti sem razmi ljal le o olimpijskem nastopu ko sem pri el v qingdao sem vedel da sem storil prav vse za uspeh dokazal sem da atenska kolajne vendarle ni bila naklju na
5627489 je prve vtise strnil 32 letni jadralec iz izole ki je tako postal deseti slovenski portnik z ve kot eno medaljo na poletnih olimpijskih igrah
5627490 so bile njegove prve besede ko je znova stopil na kopno
5627491 je dejal mo ki je v odlo ilni regati navdu il z izjemno strategijo
5627492 regato sem odjadral perfektno brez napak kljub jutranji iv nosti sem se zbral in jadral brez napak odpeljal sem tako kot sem si elel
5627493 je bil nad opravljenim delom navdu en bogar ki se v odlo ilni regati z vodilnim novozelandcem ni pretirano obremenjeval zato pa ga je v tej samostojni regati skrbel veter ki bi lahko zaustavil njegov pohod
5627494 ko sem bil v dobrem polo aju sem vsake tri sekunde pomislil da se lahko veter povsem umiri kaj bo e bo bonaca velikokrat sem imel smolo no tokrat ne sre a se mi je nasmehnila v pravem trenutku tokrat je sre a zgolj dejstvo da veter ni pojenjal
5627495 se spominja vasilij ki je s trenerjem trevorjem millarjem v zadnjih letih ve krat obiskal qindgado in se privajal na nepredvidljive razmere
5627496 id like a website for my whatever i do can you make it asap doesnt have to be anything extra ordinary but it does have to stand out though you can do whatever you like exept a b c d e f g and off course apply whatever colors to it but try avoiding i j k l m n o p oh and timing is never an issue but can you send me some layouts before q then ill let you know that youve forgotten to insert r s t u v w x y and oh yeah id like to mail the url to my friends and contacts before z would you be so kind to do that for me cool after that ill never call you again because you didnt really do what i had in mind and since i didnt pay you for it i dont owe you anything
5627497 we are going to see more flash flooding and more storms we need to plan accordingly
5627498 there will be a 20 per cent increase in precipitation in the future there will be increases in wind speed and more storms when it does rain it will be more heavily
5627499 any future significant development will have to carry out a flood risk assessment as part of the planning process
5627500 it essentially means the end of any major construction on flood plains
5627501 this is a gesture and a trust building move aimed at bolstering the moderates in the palestinian authority and the peace process
5627502 when israel frees prisoners to weak elements without demanding anything in return they remain weak
5627503 this is a decision conveying weakness and an acceptance of the existing situation
5627504 instead of adopting a resolute stance against terrorism the kadima labor government continues to release hundreds of prisoners in return for nothing
5627505 if both parties swore on the quran that they are right then the judgement is in gods hands and the syariah court can not be involved
5627506 i swore on the quran you dare or not you dont dare then dont talk
5627507 absolutely 100 percent clear and clean it did not spread they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer
5627508 i was just shaking and and then also immediately i had to go into take care of business mode which was i asked them what do i do now
5627509 i think the city of reno has really taken the right approach in getting in front of this legislation and seeing how it can benefit the community
5627510 it instills confidence not just in builders but also new home buyers that theyre moving forward instead of just waiting for something to happen
5627511 markets are continuing to pay close attention to these issues and one focus is naturally on how things are going to develop from here
5627512 for now currency markets are focused on the deterioration of japans economic conditions
5627513 investors are also in a mood to buy back the dollar in line with adjustments in commodity markets
5627514 det forventes at det turbulente ejendomsmarked p kort sigt vil have en negativ afsmitning p selskabets resultater men netop denne markedssituation i sammenh ng med selskabets gode likviditet vil medf re mulighed for s rdeles interessante projektindk b der vil underst tte selskabets v kst og indtjeningsambitioner i de kommende r
5627515 for the last three weeks our offense has come a long way before that we wasted a lot of good pitching its a shame but now were wasting a lot of offense
5627516 but its mostly an issue when we cant stop the other team
5627517 almost all the pitches they hit in the second inning were good they just did the job they had to do better than i did mine

5627526 in the near term there will be a lot of downward pressure but i dont foresee a fast collapse of pricing to 100 dollars a barrel or below there is still strong support at 110 a barrel level because of supply side issues

5627561 about a year ago we started to make environmental changes in the way we operate a lot of our clients are government and corporate clients and were very loyal to them
5627562 its been a growing concern on our minds for a while but we werent quite sure what we could do about it being that were a transport fleet weve been visiting companies that have gone carbon neutral and getting their advice

5627564 our big issue is we cant send a big six cylinder car to someones house and say its environmentally friendly the new vehicle rule is a huge step in that direction and weve investigated these cars thoroughly
5627565 weve also trialled the toyota estima hybrid which we have had for the past year now and this hybrid vehicle can hold up to 6 passengers our customers have been really stoked with the fact that were taking it seriously
5627566 we talk to them about our sustainability initiatives so they can see what were doing the drivers of the hybrids love them and so do our customers
5627567 the company has demonstrated its commitment to the environment and signalled its long term sustainability policy direction to all taxi users
5627568 we are supporting our taxicharge partners throughout new zealand in their quest for sustainability converting fleets to hybrid fuel efficient low emission vehicles is one way of achieving this

5627605 but now that hes to use a cricketing metaphor at the crease its not clear why he wanted to do the job what he wanted to achieve
5627606 and i am surprised at the sort of rudderless and indecisive nature of his premiership but thats the cause of the collapse in labours popularity they dont appear to know where theyre going anymore
5627607 i am determined that the conservative party will be seen as the party of development and i think there is an international development agenda which is very similar to the agenda that david cameron and iain duncan smith have been pursuing in the uk and we have made progress

5627644 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5627645 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home

5627688 the idea is to get energy relief money as well as the permanent fund dividend before winter hits so people have their money to offset the astronomical costs we are seeing for energy
5627689 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5627690 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5627691 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5627692 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5627693 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5627694 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5627695 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home
5627696 the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5627697 sometimes its difficult to know what a politician will actually do once in office because they say different things at different times to different people

5627702 while the numbers team is crunching data my team and i are focusing on important gaming in indonesia human behavioral patterns and psychological trends including buying patterns the impact of economic recession or boom and governnment mandates
5627703 our gaming in indonesia research division has been able to harness the power of data mining and databasing to better understand to best way forward
5627704 and as a result finding key gaming in indonesia market trends can be easily made through simple algorithms
5627705 i think its a win win situation for everyone involved
5627706 and consumers stand to benefit greatly as well in the long run competition will only drive prices down and produce higher quality products
5627707 this is an investment in our future and as such will not yield immediate results we need to look for the return 10 even 15 years down the road
5627708 its not really a race to see who finishes first as much as it is a general goal that we should all get to at some point in the future

5627719 my simple opinion is liu xiang has the right to quit this is not a disaster no matter to the games or to liu xiang
5627720 sport is something fun for human beings and its essence is to make us happier nobody has the right to establish his own happiness on other peoples suffering this is not about national honor this is not about individual morality this is all about a persons health his life and his future
5627721 everyone will understand why liu xiang had to abandon competition due to injury
5627722 and we hope he will cast aside mental burdens and settle his mind on overcoming injury

5627728 mr curran replied that the money was in his trust account so nobody gets nothing if he was in jail
5627729 mr lord believed from that that the only way to receive his money back was to facilitate mr curran being released from jail
5627730 the falsities raised by mr lord could be detected with relative ease and were detected with relative ease
5627731 this was offending that struck at the very heart of the proper administration of justice

5627734 my goodness it is a wonderful performance it brought tears to my eyes
5627735 gripping michael yorks narration and voices in dialect are top drawer artistry and bring the drama and environment and the ambience of the victorian era into such a realm that one is completely absorbed transported back to that time to live the experiences of the characters john bell youngs playing is sensitive and powerful i have found it one of the most moving audio experiences ive encountered the production is a gem
5627736 a passionate performance york throws himself into tennysons melodrama and his expertise with english accents deftly differentiates between the working class enoch and the bourgeois miller who marries his wife young brings a great sense of conviction to the 66 minute performance first class packaging too
5627737 a stunning new recording very different from any enoch ive ever heard a subtle and inward performance a heck of a fine pianist a bargain for a performance of this quality for a work of this stature a terrific recording
5627738 it is clear from the detail included in this production that it was a labor of love pianist john bell young was eager to record both the poem and the music richard strauss wrote specifically for it he brought british actor michael york on board and the two wrote essays for liner notes that nearly amount to a book the entire poem is also included as well as biographies of all involved and the history of the poem if you are not acquainted with the story with its contradictions and bitter ironies then this passionate and quite beautiful production makes for the perfect introduction york displays the crisp diction and precise pacing that keep him frequently employed as an audio book narrator he approaches the material with the appropriate degree of warmth and vigor but does so with great finesse matching the spirit of the material without overstating the obvious strausss music as presented by young is vital and undeniably dramatic
5627739 here is one of the more peculiar rarities in the strauss corpus a sprawling accompaniment to alfred lord tennysons melodrama about a young man presumably lost at sea who returns home many years later to find his wife remarried to his childhood friend remarkably two labels are competing with new recordings of enoch arden at the same time each with differing approaches yorks intimate conversational telling of the tale works far better on a recording and youngs playing is freer in manner
5627740 enoch arden is seldom performed and the few recordings include one by pianists glenn gould and claude rains as narrator english actor michael york and american pianist john bell young have just recorded it in an expressive rendition that matches the dynamic contours of the music york conveys an array of vocal colors with clarity and dramatic energy young captures the changing moods with rhythmic momentum and subtle changes as the text progresses the chemistry between york and young can be heard in the pensive opening measures and it continues throughout the piano intensity is beautifully balanced with the narrative the charisma attention to detail and intimacy of this disk make it something to share with friends

5627744 he was ultimately granted bail last friday having spent the night in custody on remand
5627745 of most concern to me is the fact he was placed as a remand prisoner in g division at yatala because i was told the adelaide remand centre was full the city watchhouse was full and other parts of yatala were full
5627746 according to the prison authorities i spoke to this was the only place they could put him
5627747 personally i find it appalling that anyone who is even serving a sentence is confined to g division unless its for disciplinary reasons because that is why it was built
5627748 but to think that young people are being placed into g division without being found guilty of an offence or sentenced is nothing short of a disgrace
5627749 g division was never built for nor was it ever contemplated that it would be used for remanded prisoners
5627750 if this what the rann governments pack em rack em and stack em policy means then we as a community have some really deep thinking to do
5627751 how would a politician feel if their son or daughter who is entitled to the presumption of innocence until proven guilty was arrested and remanded in g division it would be a different story then i bet
5627752 however the fact that the remandee was refused bail one day and then granted bail the next after he had spent a night in g division feeds growing concern that prison overcrowding was affecting bail decisions
5627753 vigorous condemnation of the use of g division for remand
5627754 bail decisions should be focussed on the prospects of the remandee returning to court not whether the government has got its act together managing cell spaces
5627755 if he had remained in custody instead of getting bail he would have been transferred to an accommodation unit
5627756 g division is used at times to house additional prisoners their stay in g division is kept to an absolute minimum
5627757 they are kept very safe from other prisoners and never come into contact with maximum security prisoners
5627758 i think the youth from 12 to 18 are kind of lost they dont know their place in the tribe
5627759 what happened to the girls over at beaver creek sad to say it woke everybody up right its sad to say that it took their deaths to bring our tribe together as one
5627760 we need more parental supervision we need more guidance we need more activities out there that will keep kids involved
5627761 we need a recreation area around here where kids can play basketball
5627762 kids drop out of school and dont finish their education
5627763 i think my daughter tried a little too hard to try to fit in she was an impressionable age
5627764 that seems to be like a normal thing on the reservation like drugs and alcohol and she was exposed to it more and i dont know that she knew how to handle it
5627765 we have a long waiting list of people waiting to go to treatment
5627766 so we basically have the same life expectancy as somebody in africa

5627793 it would be easy to give in and let inflation get out of control thats what happened in the 1970s but it would be damaging and dangerous to the economy
5627794 all being well inflation will fall again next year and will be much closer to the two per cent target by the end of 2009 but that will only happen if people dont chase inflationary wage increases
5627795 everyone wants to protect their living standard but if everyone does it prices will just go up again as businesses try to cover their higher costs then well all be back to square one but with inflation still high

5627952 i used to go in the early 1970s when there were maybe a few thousand people at what was a mainly black event it was more west indian perhaps than it is today
5627953 when i first started coming here there were no regulatory bodies it was a sound system free for all lottery
5627954 back in those days you were lucky if you secured power from a house or flat then you could actually play at the carnival
5627955 long before i became a successful dj in clubs and festivals and on the radio i was cutting my teeth and playing live audiences at notting hill carnival in the 80s
5627956 i learned well and it placed me in the perfect position to take advantage of offers that came in 10 15 years later to play huge festivals
5627957 in the beginning it looked inwards on itself and didnt really send out the right signals to welcome other people in
5627958 over the years the various bodies have addressed that problem and turned it around and made it reflect the community
5627959 thats the asian straight gay its everybodys carnival and thats the way it should be
5627960 i think people who now come have taken ownership of it and its a fantastic spectacle a sensory delight
5627961 its still underpinned by the afro caribbean experience which is very important but it embraces everybody else thats made a valid contribution to the event
5627962 if you dont stop it already im going to do something to make you understand just what the phrase bitch slap means
5627963 it is high time that we consider introducing pre primary education in all government primary schools children should be enrolled when they are between four and five years
5627964 when children compete in standard seven they will be on an equal basis
5627965 students in areas where pre primary education is not available do not do well in standard seven
5627966 but the review will give us time to evaluate what we have there is a suggestion that we could utilise existing facilities
5627967 we should give ourselves time to put our heads together
5627968 because theres no tanks with big red stars here at all way to go buddy
5627969 on the way home from school i noticed a small speck in the sky

5628007 it is an issue of significant magnitude and it does need proper assessment and all governments working together to minimise the risks and ensure there is as little damage as possible
5628008 this really is very early work and many more factors need to be taken into account before we have concrete projections
5628009 it is going to be a negative story leading to damage of assets and loss of value

5628040 ive still got a rather lengthy amount of time before i decide anything
5628041 the pendulum is swinging very heavily in the direction of it just being over ive never sat around and not gotten ready to head to florida well not in 23 or so years anyway so to me that will likely be the last real test for me and whether or not i want to put the time and effort into getting after it one more time
5628042 next i started thinking about the original plan of pitching the 2nd half of next season thing is that urgency just is not there i miss some things i didnt think i would and dont miss many things i expected too
5628043 we saw that bmw had a poor weekend and toyota had a good weekend but i dont believe the pecking order suddenly changes
5628044 there are certainly trends and at the moment we have a very distinct upward trend whereas bmw have a little bit of a downward trend and toyota seem to fluctuate
5628045 so i dont think that the race itself shows a change to the status quo but merely reinforces the trends which have been developing for a little while
5628046 the performance in hungary reinforces the belief that we are moving in the right direction and gives me confidence that we can finish fourth in the championship and end the season with the third fastest car
5628047 we look forward to every race and i think we like the challenge of a new circuit
5628048 what i hear is the words the economy and weve started growing a garden because we dont know whats going to happen to the economy in the future
5628049 if i had 1 000 acres i dont think i would have been able to accommodate all the phone calls i had
5628050 and the next question i was frequently being asked was do you teach canning
5628051 were working at more long term solutions as opposed to being so dependent on oil and grocery stores which seem to be whacking out right now
5628052 what i hear is the words the economy and weve started growing a garden because we dont know whats going to happen to the economy in the future

5628056 goes one way we could see a re imposition of the fairness doctrine
5628057 i think it wont be called the fairness doctrine by folks who are promoting it
5628058 i think it will be called something else and i think itll be intertwined into the net neutrality debate
5628059 i think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy which by the way would have a big first amendment problem
5628060 so will web sites will bloggers have to give equal time or equal space on their web site to opposing views rather than letting the marketplace of ideas determine that
5628061 the fairness doctrine if applied on the internet would violate network neutrality principles
5628062 the network has never cared about the political positions of the senders of packets and it would violate the neutral behavior of the network if it had to start caring
5628063 perhaps more useful than the fairness doctrine would be a law requiring that fcc commissioners be technologists and visionaries instead of partisan lobbyists
5628064 americans of all political stripes are tired of politicians saying the grass is blue and the sky is green

5628105 i feel very proud too to be part of this country which has given these girls such opportunity and gives all of our children such opportunity
5628106 i also do not believe it would be possible for my children to have achieved such success without this sport
5628107 we are trained not to look for the call just to look to put the ball in the cage

5628117 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5628118 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5628119 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5628120 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5628121 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5628122 their goal is to get as much in them as possible before they go out because once theyre out they cant get caught with alcohol
5628123 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5628124 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress

5628137 i wanted to hang on but i couldnt it was unbearable if i had finished the race i would have risked my tendon i could not describe my feeling at that moment
5628138 i know i have the ability once my foot recovered
5628139 now the most important thing is to heal my injury i still have a chance next year after all im still at the peak i must be optimistic and i shouldnt blame everyone and everything but not myself i will not easily give up

5628384 were seeing that when these ceramic flat irons are used at the highest heat settings and on a daily basis to achieve straight hair they can really take a toll on the structure of the hair and cause very noticeable problems that can be hard to repair
5628385 if you look at the sales statistics you see that people are pursuing straighter hair with more vigour
5628386 most people on tv and in films have straight hair and its a trend the public is trying to emulate
5628387 the problem starts when they do it wrong or too frequently and they cause a real mess that takes a long time to fix

5628411 one of the many sad developments in education lately has been the death of latin in state schools this point is a bit debated at the moment hadriana apparently there has been a surge in interest due to books like harry potter
5628412 why cant you read pride and prejudice in the kitchen
5628413 universities arent producing enough so were all scrabbling around for the same people
5628414 quite a lot of academics live around here which means the parent body can be quite demanding
5628415 our head of department recently made a bid to increase the numbers to 16 but that was turned down weve been told by the training and development agency that the figure will stay at 12 until at least 2011
5628416 universities were happy to have pgce courses with four or five students financially that wont work now
5628417 the same benefits as any humanities degree the ability to develop and sustain argument with reference to evidence
5628418 whats more a knowledge of classical heritage is invaluable to anyone trying to understand culture in the 21st century
5628419 in 2000 the government put out a tender for software to support the teaching of latin
5628420 one aim was to improve standards in schools where the subject was being taught by trained teachers the other was to allow the majority of schools to be able to offer the subject through english or modern language teachers
5628421 you find them in state schools all over the country
5628422 i remember a girl in dagenham who did gcse by following our distance learning course the girl was highly sought after by top clubs in the field of womens football but she turned them down to concentrate on her studies and came out with an as in latin by video link
5628423 theyre becoming like gold dust i sometimes receive two inquiries a day from heads looking to hire one
5628424 the issue for higher education is how it can support this surge in interest from schools the government will always prioritise subjects like english and maths but theres no reason why it shouldnt support more training for teachers in classics
5628425 i think theres still an idea that a knowledge of latin is helpful for medicine and law
5628426 that may be a misconception but theres little doubt that latin helps with an understanding of the make up of english and other modern european languages as teachers its our job to enthuse and make that understanding a lively process
5628427 latin is marked particularly rigorously and children have to put in long hours it demands commitment as well as academic ability

5628450 its good fun were obviously in the hunt for the championship the main prize we set our stall out thats what we wanted to do after winning the second division last year with five games to go were in with a real good shout
5628451 our championship form has been pretty good all season were just in the right position now in the leading pack of the top three so if we can play the good cricket that weve set ourselves to play for the last five games well have a real good chance going into the end of the season
5628452 we play notts and durham and weve obviously got lancs the last game of the season every game at the moment in the first division of this championship is tough everyones got a good team and theyre all playing well at different times there are no easy games any more in the championship which is great for cricket
5628453 ive just been in pretty good nick for this month really and been pretty consistent which is always good in all forms of the game after the friends provident was finished from the twenty20 to the championship and the pro40
5628454 i wouldnt say im in the best form its been pretty good so far so i just want to maintain it now for the rest of the season if i do that it will turn into a bit of a good year for me
5628455 youve got to be consistent and keep doing it with our one day stuff weve got a bit more to do we won a really important game against notts last week in the last over and its little games like that youve got to win to win titles so you have to keep performing
5628456 theyve just changed the culture really theyve tried to take it on and make it more professional to give us that extra bit of edge in terms of training approach and how were going to work more behind the scenes than on the pitch really

5628465 we have a long journey ahead of us and the most important battle in guiras history to fight i trust you are all rested and ready
5628466 agh i just had three eache grak guards attack shadow and i
5628467 did we just run into some rogue guards or can anyone else confirm this
5628468 listen everyone the eache grak guards are not on our side they must be working with blizzard they are now our enemies
5628469 come on thunder lets move we have to find the others they could be in trouble
5628470 finally we have the experimental phantom laser weapon the lasers fired can rip a dragon apart instantly
5628471 right everyone we have to take out blizzard as soon as we possibly can
5628472 the humans know that they are unstoppable just as long as he survives
5628473 of course thats what were here for thunder dimari and i will cover you and i want the rest of you to cover our rear okay dont fight with us unless were in serious trouble you have to protect the sarlakian rangers without them this plan could fall apart
5628474 we need your forces to help us as we head for blizzard inaka we need you and your sarlaks to provide ranged support
5628475 great nightmares we need you all to provide your promised shadow support for us
5628476 they will not even be able to understand their deaths after
5628477 you didnt half scare me then sin i thought youd given up
5628478 right everyone cover me ill plunge this sword straight through his blackened heart
5628479 you cant escape death now if you kill me you will die too
5628480 your death is needed for the hundreds of dragons you have killed not to mention mother father or our
5628481 you dont want to know you dont want the truth restored to you before this is over
5628482 you were the one you took my memories from me
5628483 blizzard why why did you lie to me like that
5628484 i lied about your sisters death to drain you of hope so you wouldnt interfere with me but your will is stronger than i expected quite impressive for a dragon who had nothing left
5628485 what about the betrayal why why did you turn on us like that all we ever did was love you and you threw it back in our face
5628486 i couldnt stand it i had to get away from you and repay you and how did i do that sintarka
5628487 i knew that the humans would attack us eventually all other dragons did was believe and pray that they wouldnt have the guts to do such a thing as dragons will never be able to match the humans technology and as i have always believed if you cant beat them join them
5628488 maybe so but cowardice has given me the right to walk away from this fight alive unlike you brother
5628489 you worried me then sintarka for a minute there i thought you were heh heh winning
5628490 you y you dont understand i i wasnt th the biggest threat i was a d distraction agh

5628507 only if your boss wants it very often people assume that if they have an mba they should be the ceo however an mba doesnt teach experience of dealing with people all senior management is about people
5628508 mba is definitely not worth the effort my experience of people with mbas is that the qualification gives them the skills to talk the talk but certainly not to walk the walk
5628509 there was a time when i believed i should do an mba but now i believe my personal development and job prospects will be enhanced more through my coach and mentors from them i have on going access to vast amounts of experience and wisdom that i can immediately put in to practice in the real business world thats something two years in a classroom just cant compete with
5628510 it depends on why youre doing it if the criteria for success were career progression and salary increase id say no if i wanted to employ a cio id prefer practical experience over theoretical academic experience every time but if the point is to add to your toolkit and completely refresh your outlook then absolutely an mba is worth it
5628511 i think the value is to the individual those i know who have completed mbas have had to make sacrifices of money putting their immediate careers on hold or spending less time with their families post mba they have then been very driven to ensure that their careers advance accordingly and repay the sacrifices if you were to do an mba without a specific goal in mind then it may mean less to you

5628572 though the government was unable to establish beyond a reasonable doubt all the elements of the charges against velardi its conduct is well within the range of reasonableness and velardi has not provided any evidence that would allow this court to conclude otherwise
5628573 it has been a privilege to have contributed to the management and strategic development of this great company he said
5628574 with a new incoming ceo i believe that signalling now my intention to step down from both my executive and non executive roles is in the best interests of shareholders and the company
5628575 dal venezia rimasero letteralmente a bocca aperta di fronte a scene molto simili a quelle viste ieri
5628576 ero cos emozionato che non sapevo nemmeno come salutare il pubblico
5628577 a empoli tanta gente non la vedevo manco quando giocavamo contro la juve o l inter
5628578 er doctors have to listen and take the time to appreciate symptoms from patients to treat them appropriately
5628579 in this case for whatever reasons they didnt do so and missed what were obviously neurologic problems that should have led them to order a ct scan
5628580 we feel badly that she has suffered all of these injuries from her very rare cancer
5628581 none of her injuries are related to any failure of theirs
5628582 people on medicaid dont get the same treatment in the emergency room as people with private insurance
5628583 anybody with those symptoms and a blue cross blue shield card or comparable insurance would have been ct scanned on the first visit
5628584 what is more troubling to us in this case is the fact the plaintiffs counsel would introduce issues of ethnic discrimination and discrimination based on insurance status
5628585 temple has more medicaid patients than anyone in the commonwealth of pennsylvania
5628586 i want to see if i could go to college or go to a trade school or something
5628587 e cio si capisce se si pensa ache anche come puro fatto di conoscenza
5628588 fael illyar somehow ended up with rl one deciding to sleep and fael taking over fael illyar but fael wasnt quite enough to handle things fael illyar she broke in an hour after the other parts were asleep
5628589 russland muss die zusagen erf llen die pr sident medwedew gemacht hat und zwar sofort
5628590 dass russland aus den ereignissen der vergangenen zwei wochen nicht die falschen lehren zieht
5628591 gewalt kann nicht die grundlage f r die festlegung neuer grenzen rund um russland sein
5628592 der dialog mit russland geht auf verschiedenen ebenen weiter damit sie die richtige botschaft erhalten
5628593 made excuses for the employees outrageous lapses and for her own failure to administer any consequences for failing to do their jobs
5628594 were taking everybodys role and looking very carefully at the evidence that can be collected as a result of their role and making very thoughtful decisions about what discipline if any is appropriate
5628595 both of them have been very instrumental in some of the reform efforts over the last few years and i think have shown tremendous leadership and continue to be valuable assets to the department of human services despite the lack of oversight in the danieal kelly case
5628596 this new requirement addresses the need to stop flu transmission at a potential source
5628597 if they would get that done it would be a great relief
5628598 then i wont be so hesitant about her going to preschool
5628599 these vaccines have a very long track record of not only success but safety
5628600 i do not think that this should in any way be required for young children
5628601 there have not been adequate safety studies on this we dont know how children are going to react to this vaccine
5628602 its being able to be given the risks be given the benefits and decide whats appropriate for your child
5628603 this is possibly our most biblical program in the sense of welcoming the stranger
5628604 well have muslim and christian refugees too so we hope the community will welcome everyone
5628605 most anybody when they leave their country their first choice would be to go back home if they could
5628606 if you look at these groups coming here theyre among the most unlikely to go back and those having the most trouble
5628607 because we have the arabic speaking community and new jersey has a lot of diversity we do get them here
5628608 in new jersey the rent is very high and the jobs pay minimum wage
5628609 mostly we try to get them a job because we dont want to put them on public assistance
5628610 placed its whole case for murder on a 16 year old who had consumed 80 ounces of malt liquor who had a view from a darkened park across a darkened roadway
5628611 is that it were going to hang him on that
5628612 isnt it a little late for you to be out
5628613 we made up a plan that we were going to tell the cops that nobody kicked him that there were no racial slurs there was no booze and brian got hit first
5628614 does exactly what mr ramirez was doing he throws a punch
5628615 but they have gone too far when they blame these two fine young lawyers as being part of the problem
5628616 and i think with all due respect the decent thing for both lynne abraham and mayor nutter to do is to extend brian mildenberg and eric zajac an apology for their vitriolic comments that were beyond the pale
5628617 this entirely sad and sickening legal circus deserves no further attention or comment
5628618 preparing for trial in the very serious criminal case against those arrested we have no further comment about the civil case
5628619 one of the most insane obscene and disgusting things ive heard in all my public life
5628620 its a tough time for her and i hope she is able to cope with this pain
5628621 the people of india have only seen a small part of me and id like to show them that there is more to me
5628622 the first priority is to provide practical and political support to georgia
5628623 ensure russia does not learn the wrong lessons from the events of the last two weeks force cannot be the basis for the demarcation of new lines around russia
5628624 we hope that tomorrows decisions by nato will be balanced and that responsible forces in the west will give up the total cynicism that has been so evident which is pushing us back to the cold war era
5628625 we need to open the door to get the military monitors in now
5628626 documentary evidence shows that advantage is an example of marketing framed as science
5628627 failure to disclose the primary purpose of a trial has ethical ramifications for patients physicians and the design of clinical trials
5628628 seeding trials like advantage in which the study medication has yet to receive fda u s food and drug administration approval may cause patient injury for marketing purposes
5628629 the data continues to be quite poor and retail data out this week is also likely to be pretty sluggish which is making people more confident that there will be a rate cut before christmas
5628630 the fact that well be able to access ecb funding was obviously a consideration but not the only reason
5628631 launching in ireland will enable nationwide to further diversify its geographical operations and funding opportunities and improve our balance sheet which is already has one of the strongest in uk financial services in terms of its construct and its quality
5628632 this is due to a combination of extremely high oil prices which represent the majority of the sites costs and lower nickel prices
5628633 the resumption of activities will be assessed based on market conditions which are expected to improve towards the end of 2008
5628634 the suspension will also enable the acceleration of feasibility studies into the energy conversion project to switch the operations power source from oil to coal and the development of the loma miranda project which will provide a new higher grade mining area for falcondo and extend the mine life
5628635 dyfed powys is a very high performing force and what im keen to do is build upon the solid foundations that already exist here
5628636 clearly ive got some areas i want to concentrate on one in particular is to make sure that we concentrate on the minor crimes as well as the more serious crimes
5628637 im sending some very very clear messages to our staff about the levels of service dress and presentation that i expect from them at all times
5628638 im particularly keen to use technology to minimise some of the problems of geography that is a major issue for us such a large area limited resources managing that to public expectations is a constant challenge
5628639 also through proper communications we can make sure we can send cars to where they are required
5628640 we want to increase the visibility of our staff and perhaps the main thing we can do in that area is make sure they are sent to the right incidents
5628641 our police community support officers pcsos are vital to improving visibility across the force area and we want to make sure they are out nearly all of their time
5628642 if at all possible we will seek to increase their numbers in forthcoming years
5628643 in my first three months here there have been three murders and some very very serious offences and ive been very pleased to see we have the staff with the skills and the expertise to deal with those issues
5628644 one of the core issues for us at the moment is 60 of the people passing through our custody suites have a form of drug problem or certainly have drugs in their system at the time of arrest
5628645 at the moment we have not got access to treatment or support services for those individuals
5628646 i think what needs to happen is politicians and the government need to rise above party politics so people can be supported and helped
5628647 otherwise we will just be arresting people releasing them and seeing the same people come through custody time and time again
5628648 todays verdict marks the end of an intense and complex inquiry
5628649 let there be no doubt these are dangerous individuals these men were not simply in possession of material which expressed extremist views they were also in possession of material that was operationally useful to anyone wishing to carry out an act of violence or terrorism

5628653 son of santa this could be some wacky fantastic fun like those chris moore books that are so entertaining
5628654 using a 3 000 degree acetylene torch in a wood frame building is like using matches in a barn full of hay wood and flames do not mix
5628655 if one piece had been different this fire would not have started and spread the way it did
5628656 my eyes werent lying to me when i saw how fast that erupted how fast that spread
5628657 i saw the lack of retardant without the firewalls and it doesnt take a lot of brains to realize there could have been something done better or differently
5628658 now that does not mean it wasnt done according to code this is really a question of addressing code in the future
5628659 it is no longer a question of how its a question of when
5628660 i thought id be okay in the light air but im not that was a lot to do with being sick for two weeks right before it started
5628661 i only stopped antibiotics two days ago so its bloody hard to compete like that youre always slightly on the backfoot because you just havent got the oomph
5628662 i was completely off the pace from the beginning so even getting to the medal race was pretty good
5628663 i dont know what im doing yet but im just going to have a break maybe if its windy in london we might go but were definitely not going to race in qingdao again
5628664 the tree has multiple trunks and each has many living branches
5628665 we are hopeful that it will have new sprouting and that it will live
5628666 thank you for your courage for protecting civilians for standing in the way of those who brought death to the people of south ossetia
5628667 georgian infrastructure will be rebuilt georgias economy will be reinforced
5628668 they could not do anything bad to the people because there were no people in the town
5628669 the russians have to keep their promises this is a never ending story and there is not a single sign that they will begin the withdrawal as they said they would
5628670 it just amazes me i dont see how the american public in the end gains by all of the theatrics
5628671 mr mandracchia and the others theyre all of good will and theyre a little frustrated by lawyers arguing
5628672 the last thing we want to do is prolong this
5628673 if we are finally permitted to put on our case we will show everyone we have a very strong case
5628674 theres nothing she could say that would make their case
5628675 a distraction from what were trying to do at the park
5628676 and that doesnt serve the public the community or our heritage
5628677 i think its the most beautiful performance in the world
5628678 are a priority of our nation so we think our thing is the best
5628679 were not worried about it weve seen this movie before
5628680 there are bad storms and there are nice ones and this is a nice one
5628681 it cleans out all the trees it gives people a little work to do and it gets the tourists out of here for a few days
5628682 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5628683 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5628684 suddenly you find youre out there walking in a storm
5628685 hates it when mornings dont start off as hed planned
5628686 yo te cubro a t y t me cubres a m de electrones
5628687 there is certainly a need to improve access to mainstream sexual health services for aboriginal people
5628688 continuing access to effective sexual health service delivery is an essential part of reducing sexually transmissible infections among aboriginal people
5628689 this workshop is an opportunity for workers from mainstream organisations to carefully reflect on how their services are organised and delivered and how they can work better with aboriginal people
5628690 cerebral malaria is lethal 20 percent of the time in the best of hands and here weve shown that something as simple as aspirin because of its affect on platelets might be able to improve the outcomes of those who contract this deadly form of the disease
5628691 the take home lesson is that platelets by releasing pf4 are playing an early role in the wind up phase of cerebral malaria
5628692 our mouse studies show that timing is critical with the mice we know when we infected them and controlled when we treated them a big challenge in translating this to humans is that people dont know when they get infected
5628693 nature has developed all of this firepower for getting things into cells and one of the ways is to create entities that are arginine rich
5628694 arginine rich sequences appear to figure in the mechanisms by which many pathogens invade cells
5628695 its an exciting result to be able to take a drug known to work against cancer but stymied by resistant cells and restore it to effectiveness using an arginine transporter
5628696 this bodes well for use with other drugs that succumb to resistance
5628697 in essence the technology can be used to overcome one of the most challenging types of problems of drug resistance
5628698 if youre not recognized as being part of the club then youre kicked out
5628699 if we think of the pump as being a bouncer for the cellular club then effectively what were doing is disguising one of these therapeutic agents to get it in through the back door or the side door
5628700 this could potentially be used with any drug which is effective but has a delivery problem
5628701 as the transporter with all these arginine guanidinium groups approaches the cell it basically does a handshake using hydrogen bonds with cell surface constituents that are in the membrane
5628702 in essence it changes its physical properties by shaking hands with all these cell membrane components
5628703 ovarian cancer has a drug taxol that works pretty well in the beginning seventy or eighty percent of the patients have a response
5628704 but it fails at the end because drug resistance develops
5628705 we found that mosquitoes can smell deet and they stay away from it
5628706 deet doesnt mask the smell of the host or jam the insects senses mosquitoes dont like it because it smells bad to them
5628707 for decades we were told that deet warded off mosquito bites because it blocked insect response to lactic acid from the host the key stimulus for blood feeding
5628708 dr leal and co workers escaped the key stimulus over simplification to show that mosquito responses like our own result from a balancing of various positive and negative factors all impinging on a tiny brain more capable than most people think of sophisticated decision making
5628709 one of the great attributes of science is that over time it is self correcting
5628710 i was so delighted when i first encountered the neuron that detects deet a synthetic compound
5628711 i couldnt believe my eyes because it goes against conventional wisdom so i repeated the experiment over and over until we discussed the findings in the lab
5628712 despite the fact that deet is the industry standard mosquito repellent relatively little is known about how it actually works
5628713 previous studies have suggested a masking or binding with host emanations understanding the mode of action is especially important because deet is used as the standard against which all other tentative replacement repellents are compared
5628714 in the future this new knowledge can be incorporated into developing new repellents and may be in control strategies for culex quinquefasciatus and other mosquitoes
5628715 carl woese and his colleagues years ago established that protein translation had to be well developed when the evolution of modern cells started
5628716 so the evolution of cells and the evolution of translation are really linked to one another
5628717 to be a molecular signature a sequence has to be common to all members of a single domain of life but not another
5628718 until the 2000s when these structures became available you werent able to correlate where these signatures were with what was touching them in 3 d space
5628719 so nobody had ever done this sort of analysis before
5628720 the ramifications of this work are it gives you a much better way to probe how this universal machinery changes from one organism to another
5628721 in that the ribosome constitutes the core of the cellular translation mechanism which is the sine qua non of gene expression which is the essence of life as we know it these findings constitute a major step in understanding the evolution of life which is still a journey of a thousand miles

5628764 the wonderful thing about having it close by is that it means there are more opportunities for all of the cultural community in philadelphia to connect and work with tyler
5628765 they had this romantic notion they wanted tyler to remain in the spot where they had gone to school
5628766 if they hadnt been back in 20 years they werent seeing how it was today
5628767 tyler is about creativity and pushing contemporary boundaries and to have anything other than a contemporary building is odd
5628768 i wish i was the law medical or business school dean
5628769 it was idyllic there were beautiful plantings it was one of those little gems that you have when youre growing up that you dont appreciate
5628770 it smelled of linseed oil which is from the oil paint its a smell that you never forget
5628771 the technology has changed the scale in which people do art now has changed and it really needs the kind of space that theyre going to have

5628799 i heard this massive crash and rumble crunching metal it sounded initially like a thunderstorm but then we heard shouts and screams
5628800 from what i could see a coach had crashed at the hill and ploughed through a neighbours garden it ploughed through two cars parked in a driveway one of them was bouncing down the road the other must have flown along with the coach
5628801 it must have dropped about 20ft it was on a slope there were people climbing out of the fire exits on the bus the majority were walking wounded
5628802 theres a bad bend at the bottom of the hill which is in line with the neighbours driveway they couldnt have managed to take the corner and had no choice but to go through
5628803 its an extremely dangerous road a narrow country road its mayhem absolute mayhem we had a torrential downpour just before it happened i was in the pub when someone came in screaming for blankets and sheets we all went to help but the area had been cordoned off

5628881 stigningen viser for det f rste at bankerne og realkreditinstitutterne har sm kket kassen i som f lge dels af den internationale kreditkrise og dels af faldende priser p ejendomsmarkedet
5628882 for det andet at dem der har brug for at finansiere deres l bende forbrug vil f store problemer med at betale g lden tilbage fordi de optager meget dyr g ld s vi forventer at antallet af personlige konkurser vil stige
5628883 vi har set det samme m nster i usa i en periode nu hvor forbrugerne i stadig stigende grad bruger kreditkort til at finansiere forbruget med idet bankerne ikke l ngere er s villige til at l ne penge ud og her er antallet af personer der ikke kan betale deres g ld tilbage stigende
5628884 som udgangspunkt er det fristende at konkludere at nogle danskere lever over evne og de dermed i stigende omfang presses over i skyh je renter fordi bankerne ikke er villige til at finansiere deres forbrugsfest

5628887 med andre ord s syntes den prim re forklaring p den hastige v kst i blankol nene at danskerne er for sl sede med deres privat konomi i konomisk gunstige tider dagens tal er som udgangspunkt ikke videre bekymrende for den overordnede konomiske situation herhjemme

5628930 some kid must have broken in here and posted those
5628931 such behavior leaves a clear impression with citizens and constituents that state of iowa employees are being bad neighbors
5628932 we didnt know going into it if the economy would hurt the attendance at the fair or the flooding and weather earlier this summer would help or hurt
5628933 with gas prices as they are the fair remains one of those favorite vacation destinations
5628934 it doesnt bother me when you factor in the cost of transportation and everything else thats still pretty reasonable
5628935 our main emphasis was on providing a quality lunch program to our students we needed staff stability in the program
5628936 a 10 cent increase is completely fair and if anything it wouldnt have surprised me if it had increased 25 cents and i would still be willing to pay it
5628937 our school meals are provided at a very subsidized reasonable price for our income level
5628938 besides i spend a lot more on my lunches daily than i do for school lunches
5628939 the increase is more than fair i dont think i could feed her at home for 2 a meal and the food quality seems to be fine i havent heard too many complaints over the years
5628940 i do want her to tell me if she purchases extra portions so i can budget for that but i think the meals are balanced and the prices are manageable
5628941 i think the nutrition department is spending more time to find lunch items that are nutritious taste good and are within the budget
5628942 healthy foods are what we as parents would expect but they can be expensive just look at your grocery receipt
5628943 it all seems like part of a domino effect since prices are higher for everything
5628944 the increase doesnt surprise me and was expected we wont be impacted drastically although i could see for those on a tight budget with several kids it would make a difference
5628945 my biggest issue is the quality of the food the kids are getting or maybe i should say the health value of their selections
5628946 with childhood obesity at an all time high i wish there would be fewer menu choices that are just not good for the kids if you have it on the menu theyre going to select it but if it wasnt even an option the kids might be forced to choose healthier foods
5628947 were trying to manage everything as fiscally responsible as possible so we can expand our footprint while keeping it affordable for citizens
5628948 our tax rate is certainly in line with the rest of the districts around central iowa the reality is i think the tax rate is fair given the challenges we face and the growth thats ahead of us
5628949 i think its a growing district and we have to expect that were going to pay taxes
5628950 going to another school in ankeny does not equate to a worse education or fewer friends or fewer experiences than you had before
5628951 i have no reservations whatsoever about my child being in this building with these teachers
5628952 we presented this as an opportunity to meet many more kids before he goes to parkview
5628953 almost palatable hatred for those who cooperate with law enforcement
5628954 they still have to prove that he pulled the trigger
5628955 so far all weve talked about is character youre not here to decide whether dennis schofield is a good guy
5628956 i think people will love it theyll see a new fresh look
5628957 it has the bridging look pulling together our city the east west side businesses and residents its a new look and a new feel
5628958 theres always some risk when you do these things that someone wont like it
5628959 but i think we collectively feel like its a great piece
5628960 we engaged quite of bit of resources to finish the west steps and the intention was that the triathlon was going to stay there
5628961 hopefully this will alleviate the anxiety about flooding should we have more heavy spring rains in the future
5628962 we were disappointed we will not be showcasing this building
5628963 i dont know if this decision is final final final
5628964 the speed and breadth of what we did was affected by the triathlon
5628965 to have them because of a 500 year flood tuck tail and run is highly bothersome
5628966 we love des moines and we chose des moines because of some of those exact reasons
5628967 many people dont understand what goes on behind the scenes to pull off an event of that magnitude
5628968 but if i had to make the decision itd be in des moines
5628969 i feel the saydel district is one of the premier districts in the state in student achievement and involvement
5628970 our discretion is much more limited than what most of the appellants and especially the public understand it
5628971 there have been times where there have been people who have been very disappointed
5628972 sometimes there were very good policy reasons to deny a permit as far as environmental protection but none of it fell within the authority we had
5628973 the important thing to remember is that our authority to overturn the departments decision has to be founded in the rather narrow group of exceptions that are contained in the law
5628974 have the right as much as i do to contest it but what they dont understand is that they lay a set of rules out and if you follow those rules youre supposed to be allowed to build those buildings
5628975 i would like to continue to focus on raising student achievement parental involvement and completion of the high school within budget
5628976 these deployments are all tough but im old enough to know that a year goes by quick
5628977 i think history will record that this is a most significant period of time for the iowa guard
5628978 we have classrooms where there shouldnt be classrooms we have to try to bring this district together to come up with a solution everyone can live with
5628979 we have to figure out what our high standards should be for a changing world
5628980 and we have to do it in an environment where our district is growing and we have facilities issues to deal with those are big challenges
5628981 i dont favor one group over another im not saying other people do im just saying im not doing something out of gain for myself
5628982 ought to be voted on as a stand alone issue
5628983 its a decision that has the ability to change the culture of the community
5628984 ever since i left the board people said i had to come back
5628985 some people thought two high schools werent a foregone conclusion in march 2007
5628986 there have been so many plans since then that a lot of ankeny is feeling confused
5628987 provide checks and balances on the decisions educators should be making
5628988 is the path that has been chosen i hope we dont keep clinging to old issues or we will clog this wheel up pretty badly
5628989 that basically heightened my awareness of the responsibilities of the school board
5628990 our process has to be able to keep up with the growing world around us
5628991 i am in 100 percent agreement with the districts already approved 10 year plan my passions align with the direction superintendent matthew wendt wants to take this district
5628992 when information isnt there that builds mistrust we have people pushing for the same goals but because they dont have the same information they end up not trusting each others motives
5628993 right or wrong i think the community has learned to not trust the spending reports from the district and its architects
5628994 this has already been in the hands of the public
5628995 if they didnt want two high schools in march 2007 they should have voted against the referendum then
5628996 i want to help ankeny resolve issues and be the best it can be to get children ready for the real world
5628997 i probably dont have the most experience of all the candidates but i am 100 percent committed
5628998 we are kind of in the middle of some things and i want to make sure we move forward
5628999 weve looked at what others have done and weve looked at what is best for ankeny and thats what is incorporated in our 10 year plan
5629000 were really scrutinizing the budget to see where we can cut out disposable items and other things that do not impact the quality of food
5629001 our school meals are provided at a very subsidized reasonable price for our income level
5629002 a 10 cent increase is completely fair and if anything it wouldnt have surprised me if it had increased 25 cents and i would still be willing to pay it
5629003 the reality is there are only so many dollars in those lunch budgets and they cant subsidize from other places
5629004 its becoming more and more difficult for us to keep costs low but were doing everything we can
5629005 of course our highest priority is to make sure we provide the most nutritious foods possible to our students
5629006 we lock into prices at the beginning of the year so last year during the school year we saw food prices increase drastically and now we have to pay for that this year as well as anticipate what the trend will be for the upcoming school year its almost like a double whammy
5629007 i would say it is fuel and the weather weve had across the u s hurricanes tornados drought and widespread flooding its a combination of everything
5629008 the things that are happening right now are going to affect us down the road the floods of this year have yet to affect us so who knows what our pricing will do
5629009 it is a significant increase but it is a question of economics and food prices have increased significantly since the beginning of the last school year
5629010 parents understand meals going up a little every year its when you dont do it for several years that its more of a shell shock
5629011 its still a pretty cheap lunch if you ask me
5629012 its just like preparing my meals at home its costly and i have to think about what im serving
5629013 we have to stop and think about what were purchasing
5629014 plus it is back to school friendly and they can put it in their lunch boxes
5629015 with this background i will be able to bring a fresh set of eyes and ideas to policy and school decision making to ensure policies are to the benefit of all students
5629016 its never appropriate to run for election to office to advance ones personal agenda or try to advantage one group over another my goals in running are to maintain and improve on the education received by johnston students and to continue and improve on the boards engagement with students and faculty
5629017 several years ago i led a comprehensive one year pro bono communications audit of the entire des moines public school district that encompassed a review of all lines of communication as well as developed models for improved community relations and formalized community feedback to the district to aid in board and district decision making
5629018 refocusing the boards attention on curriculum and raising students academic performance
5629019 being a parent of three elementary age children i am in touch with the academic and educational needs of this age group
5629020 we spend many hours as a family participating in our local community education programs and various sport clubs and leagues
5629021 is to be an accessible board member that is informed on all the issues facing the board and to work in the best interest of our school district
5629022 because i am already familiar with our district and its strengths challenges and issues i want to continue to serve the educational needs of the children and families of our community
5629023 i believe that it is important to come to the board with a willingness and a commitment to listen to all sides of an issue and to make a decision that will reflect no bias and is in line with the districts vision policies and student achievement goals
5629024 being an instructor at the community college helps me see first hand what skills learned in high school help students be successful in college
5629025 my overall emphasis is to ensure that we are preparing all of our students for life after high school whether that is going to a four year university or going straight into the work force
5629026 ive learned a number of ways to make extra money from advertisers
5629027 the cost of grain has gone up dramatically anything breaded or made with bread were looking at 25 percent increases
5629028 were hoping that the rise in lunch prices wont affect any of the quality
5629029 well still do healthy items such as our wheat rolls and whole wheat products
5629030 its such a small change that i didnt notice it when i enrolled
5629031 for the convenience and knowing hes gonna get a good hot lunch i have no problem paying the extra
5629032 because i believe that as a school board member i have an opportunity to make a positive impact on the education children in our community are provided
5629033 i voted for the grade configuration that will be in place this fall because it keeps more children in their home community when they are young
5629034 we are occupying a new building and we have a new administrative position and new administrators like the high school principal
5629035 i want to continue to see that those people develop and help them to further our goals as a district
5629036 we have to stay on top of that and manage whatever happens
5629037 that was more of a matter of us believing we were not at a point where we have true neighborhood schools
5629038 the education foundation we provide our kids is even more important today with global competition for jobs i want to help define the direction we take as a district in preparing our students for life after secondary education
5629039 it has been my pleasure to work with the other board members for the past three years alongside our administration to support our teachers and all district personnel in providing a great educational environment for our students
5629040 we have more to do but will face the challenges in a collaborative and positive manner
5629041 i view my time on the board as a good way for me to give back to the community
5629042 the administration is aware of what improvements need to be made to see that every child gets the best education possible the board is there to look at the big picture and give guidance
5629043 we need to continue to support and challenge our students through curriculum improvements stressing rigor and relevance
5629044 theres a long tradition in west des moines to have really good people on the board
5629045 and this is the beginning of what we hope will be an annual tradition again
5629046 it is a fine affair in fresh air and they will enjoy every minute of it rain or shine
5629047 there will be divine cuisine a beautiful facility a full orchestra
5629048 my purpose in doing this is gratitude for what the life center did for my parents
5629049 and it has just continued to build and improve over the years
5629050 we want to attract them and get them involved in sustaining our elders and our community for the future
5629051 i think the broader community doesnt necessarily know about us
5629052 weve had many many non jewish residents and we hope that the families of those residents will want to come to the event
5629053 weve already raised more than 50 000 and were very happy with that
5629054 theyre 21 years old and they need to be a little more like home
5629055 eine reihe sinnloser kurzgeschichten in der die hauptfigur ein mann namens jesus erst weit nach der h lfte auftaucht
5629056 youre going to be mad at me i found a gun
5629057 eine solche vorgangsweise widerspricht eklatant den empfehlungen der wirtschaftskammer zum damals geltenden wertpapieraufsichtsgesetz die diese zur sorgfaltspflicht bei der anlageberatung erarbeitet hat
5629058 it has enabled us to take an approach which is based on trying to achieve human excellence hiring the best people we can get on getting riders supported in the way they should be supported
5629059 they must be pretty sad people is what i say have a look at the sheer joy that there is up and down this country
5629060 ive been up at 6 am every morning to watch it and i bet millions of other people have
5629061 i daresay im not the only person to shed a tear or two of sheer delight when weve seen our young men and women win i think it has uplifted the whole country
5629062 if we can produce more rebecca adlingtons more beckhams more kenneth branaghs in the arts then i think the whole country benefits
5629063 i think we let our youngsters down i very much regret that i wasnt able to do that and i still hope that will be possible
5629064 sport isnt an add on to society its an integral part of it
5629065 this funding for sport it isnt only for the olympians they only get to be olympians if we have the facilities at a lower level at schools after schools in clubs in the inner cities and we need to build that up
5629066 i had that dream really from the day i first walked into my first full time job as a games programmer i wanted to be the guy running the company i was a little foolish in that thinking because the work it takes to run a company is a hundred times more than your imagination can even begin to speculate on
5629067 i just didnt understand that running a games studio was getting away from the singular focus that you have when youre an individual working inside a company your focus becomes so broad you have to keep track of so many different things and your day is not dictated by your own creative whim
5629068 thats a little bit of the darker side but on the positive side weve created our own original ips consistently some are great some are not so great but the fact is you have to keep throwing darts at that board
5629069 you have to keep trying to make great stuff and you cant do that if youre inside of a large megalithic organisation to the same degree unless you can navigate that organisation
5629070 but when you have your own company thats the return thats the deal you make you accept youll bore your own brains out with complexity and solving problems that arent the problems you used to solve theyre not game design problems theyre banking problems theyre legal problems theyre accounting problems
5629071 on the flipside the games im working on are the games i want to make
5629072 you develop muscles and certainly eyes wide open now id know what i was getting into i might approach things a little differently i might outsource more for example
5629073 its the difference between jumping from the riverboat and being swept downriver and surviving to make the bottom or going white water rafting with all the right equipment
5629074 the river is the same river no matter how big the drop offs are and ultimately how dangerous it is thats the business but at the end of the day i do feel like ive developed a skill set for this of course there are days when i could use a break but then id get right back on the horse again
5629075 now this government will have no one but themselves to blame for all that
5629076 assess supervise and monitor the delivery of care to assure basic needs
5629077 the nursing staff had evaluated the patients nutrition the review revealed no nutritional consult was requested and revealed no evidence the physician was notified about the inadequate nutritional intake
5629078 they said he was lying down and didnt feel like talking
5629079 they wouldnt let me see him i think he died that day
5629080 i have not seen the heimlich maneuver now in over 20 years i couldnt see well or tell if he was injured by the fall

5629087 origin has rejected bg groups offer but has comprehensively failed to justify its position
5629088 we remain confident that our offer represents full and fair value for origins shareholders
5629089 forecast or other financial information which could assist shareholders in valuing the company and making a timely and informed decision
5629090 your directors believe bgs offer undervalues origins existing business and outstanding prospects and therefore recommend that you unanimously reject bgs offer
5629091 origin is a strongly performing australian integrated energy company with an impressive track record of growth
5629092 origin has developed the leading position in coal seam gas csg in australia and the strength of this position will be a key driver for continuing growth
5629093 helicopters arrived on station soon after and engaged these insurgents as they attempted to flee from the scene
5629094 three of the insurgents killed themselves by detonating their suicide vests isaf forces killed three other suicide bombers before they could detonate their vests there were no isaf casualties in the attack
5629095 cyber bullying is not under any definition trespass or theft
5629096 cyber bullying is a relatively new phenomenon as is social networking
5629097 it is therefore not surprising that there have been relatively few prosecutions in this area
5629098 as a tool to address all manner of cyber crimes
5629099 moreover the vehicle for the cyber bullying at issue here a social networking web site only became mainstream after 2000
5629100 invites a host of difficult thorny problems and unwanted results
5629101 i think the youth from 12 to 18 are kind of lost they dont know their place in the tribe
5629102 what happened to the girls over at beaver creek sad to say it woke everybody up right its sad to say that it took their deaths to bring our tribe together as one
5629103 we need more parental supervision we need more guidance we need more activities out there that will keep kids involved
5629104 we need a recreation area around here where kids can play basketball
5629105 kids drop out of school and dont finish their education
5629106 i think my daughter tried a little too hard to try to fit in she was an impressionable age
5629107 that seems to be like a normal thing on the reservation like drugs and alcohol and she was exposed to it more and i dont know that she knew how to handle it
5629108 we have a long waiting list of people waiting to go to treatment
5629109 so we basically have the same life expectancy as somebody in africa
5629110 we are very excited by this evidence that they occur at sebangau

5629209 the conflict between south ossetia and georgia is in effect a conflict between russia and the united states it is a conflict that has been building for some time
5629210 i think the main reason for the destruction of yugoslavia was the ambition of nato to move eastward although the cold war had ended the cold warriors were still in power washington still felt russia was its biggest threat because it had so many nuclear weapons and washington wanted to move up to the borders of the former soviet union jungewelt de 31st july 2008 the georgian attack on south ossetia was part of the us nato strategy of moving towards the russian border georgia is a us client state its president mikheil saakashvili is harvard educated and a former employee of the new york law firm patterson belknap webb and tyler the georgian army is armed and trained by the us it is inconceivable that georgia took military action without the approval of the united states one month before georgia launched its attack the us secretary of state condoleezza rice visited tbilisi and met with president saakashvili and issued a provocative statement denouncing russia and giving us backing for georgias nato membership what the bush administration thought russias response to the georgian aggression would be is not known but for the first time russia militarily hit back at the us foreign policy strategy and immediately was accused by president bush of not respecting the sovereignty of nations one wonders whether to laugh or cry at such hypocrisy nevertheless the announcement that us troops are being sent to the region under the guise of humanitarian aid only emphasises that this whole us strategy carries with it the inherent threat of further conflicts and the unthinkable prospect of a nuclear war

5629313 broadband users of major telecommunication firms are growing rapidly at rates of 50 to almost 100 percent year on year whereas they are increasing mobile telephone subscribers at annual rates of only 23 to 25 percent
5629314 we see falling broadband user rates as well as declining personal computer prices driving broadband growth in the months ahead

5629337 as someone who comes from kitgum district i am particularly encouraged by indian businessmen who have penetrated the villages and brought commodities right to the doorsteps of the wanainchi

5629342 the idea of diplomatic reconciliation and diplomatic truce that i have proposed is aimed at improving cross taiwan strait relations
5629343 as for our allies who have supported us all this time we will only consolidate bilateral friendships even more
5629344 if our allies would like to develop substantive relations such as economic or cultural relations with china taiwan will be pleased to see that as well just as taiwan would like to do the same with chinas allies
5629345 diplomatic truce is a strategy that serves multilateral interests as not only relations between taiwan and china are improved but relations between taiwan and the u s are also improved
5629346 allies of both taiwan and china will all benefit from improved cross strait relations

5629358 the weekends torrential rain and flooding was not a freak event but rather part of a pattern that has emerged over the past few years
5629359 the executive is doing its best to respond to the aftermath of flooding but surely it is now time for a more strategic approach
5629360 if as seems to be the case outbursts of torrential rain are becoming a characteristic of northern irelands climate government departments and agencies should have plans in place to minimise both the chances of flooding and the disruption which follows floods
5629361 when the range of departments and agencies involved is considered doe drd northern ireland fire and rescue service northern ireland ambulance service psni roads service rivers agency local government there is a case to be made for a body to co ordinate not just the response to flooding but how best to reduce its likelihood
5629362 the recently published pitt report into the 2007 floods in england has emphasised the need for co ordinated planning and responses both in terms of addressing flood risk and in establishing best practice in the event of flooding
5629363 its recommendations should be carefully considered by the executive and any lessons for northern ireland should be learned quickly
5629364 the fact that from thursday onwards we had additional staff in brought in extra staff for the telephone centres prepared tens of thousands of sand bags we put in place and purchased additional pumping equipment for the fire service and rivers agency

5629366 the emergency services did plan for this they met on thursday and on friday they did prepare and they did communicate with each other

5629395 ik heb doorgezet we trainden n minuut per dag e n minuut op een gegeven moment zag ik vooruitgang daarna zijn we twee minuten per dag gaan trainen
5629396 at gennemskue udbudsmaterialet det var suver nt det mest omfattende og komplicerede udbud vi nogensinde har set alene det at forst det til bunds var en uhyre kompliceret aff re det gik jo ogs om fordi ingen af bureauerne kunne levere et fejlfri tilbud i f rste omgang p den m de kan man med god ret diskutere om ikke den type udbud har fjernet sig for langt fra den ydelse der eftersp rges nemlig at l se en kommunikationsudfordring
5629397 jeg betaler jo ogs skat og jeg hylder som princip at der er lige og retf rdige muligheder for at v lge de bedste og billigste tilbud uanset om det er kantinem bler asfalt eller kommunikation konkurrence er ogs med til at sk rpe os p bureauet vi giver det bedste vi har og ofte er det gennem vores tilbud vi udvikler ny t nkning og nye l sninger som bringe vores generelle kompetencer videre
5629398 den prim re l ring er at vi kun vinder hvis vi giver 130 der er ingen genveje lette l sninger eller feje tricks desv rre man skal kun g med i et udbud hvis man virkelig giver alt hvad man har og prioriterer tiden og resurserne til det det kr ver overskud b de mentalt og m lt i tid
5629399 der er flere ting der afg r det for det f rste skal man svare p det kunden beder om
5629400 det betyder at man skal beskrive hvordan tilgangen til at l se opgaven er i dette tilf lde skrev vi en forretningsplan med etablering af sekretariat med bningstider call center hotline uddannelse af medarbejdere kvalitetssikringsprogram kriseplaner hvordan vi vil arbejde med at udvikle en kampagne etc faktisk er det en fordel for bureauet forbi vi efterf lgende har mere frie h nder til at arbejde med vores kreative l sninger vi er kommunikationseksperterne og dermed er det os der skaber den kreative l sning vi skal blot dokumentere at vi holder de planer vi har skitseret

5629403 anyone who tries anything like that will face a crushing response
5629404 the city is a cold place now people are fearful
5629405 i think the youth from 12 to 18 are kind of lost they dont know their place in the tribe
5629406 what happened to the girls over at beaver creek sad to say it woke everybody up right its sad to say that it took their deaths to bring our tribe together as one
5629407 we need more parental supervision we need more guidance we need more activities out there that will keep kids involved
5629408 we need a recreation area around here where kids can play basketball
5629409 kids drop out of school and dont finish their education
5629410 i think my daughter tried a little too hard to try to fit in she was an impressionable age
5629411 that seems to be like a normal thing on the reservation like drugs and alcohol and she was exposed to it more and i dont know that she knew how to handle it
5629412 we have a long waiting list of people waiting to go to treatment
5629413 so we basically have the same life expectancy as somebody in africa
5629414 squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5629415 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5629416 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5629417 hogans legal arguments are unsupported by case authority and without merit
5629418 here as the party challenging the summonses hogan has the heavy burden of rebutting the governments good faith showing
5629419 he has failed to carry that burden with naked arguments and bald assertions without evidence in support of such allegations are insufficient to rebut a prima facie case for summons enforcement
5629420 first hogan is wrong because the summonses do not seek tax returns
5629421 second hogan is wrong because resident status is not the test for whether an investigation is unnecessary

5629424 the mid west coast of western australia is fast becoming a significant military installation with facilities that will enable the us military and its allies to coordinate air strikes and military manoeuvres in the middle east and asia being built near the existing australian defence signals directorate
5629425 this is the wrong time to be upping the ante on military ties with the us
5629426 we are very much into the idea of large american military bases sprouting without a word of consultation to the local people when the security challenges we face arent military they are environmental and economic

5629494 clean coal renewables and yellowcake we must include nuclear in our future baseload clean energy mix
5629495 inconvenient truth that only nuclear power could provide baseload electricity while cutting emissions
5629496 burying mere tonnes of radioactive waste in geological stable rock was low risk
5629497 our view is that there needs to be consideration in australia given to the development of a nuclear power industry dr nelson said
5629498 we need more rational discussion about nuclear power in australia and much less of the emotive political debate weve had in the last few years
5629499 we cannot envisage any circumstance under which australia will have a nuclear power industry he said then
5629500 the last election showed that australians are absolutely of one mind about not having 25 nuclear power plants dotted around their suburbs and in and around their cities mr garrett said
5629501 are they really saying that they have a plan for 25 nuclear reactors in australia where are they going to put them senator wong said
5629502 australia has an abundance of renewable energy sources we have a lot of solar we have a lot of wind we have geothermal resources she said
5629503 we dont believe its appropriate for australia to go down the nuclear path

5629521 it just feels fantastic to come in with a medal this time and the fact that its gold is just amazing
5629522 i always knew it was going to be a bit of an up and down regatta i didnt start great in the first race but bounced straight back and then from there i was always within reaching distance and sailed a superb day yesterday to give myself the cushion i needed for today
5629523 i think that if the winds here had been a little bit stronger and the racing had been normal then i would have just sailed my race because i would have been more confident that i wasnt going to lose
5629524 but because the wind was so light and so random the only way to guarantee winning was to do what i did
5629525 my heart feels for him i feel sorry for him but at the end of the day you have to do whats best for you

5629537 teenagers found naked and starving parents refused to clothe and feed children
5629538 billy brown 14 and his sister janie brown 13 were found in their middle class home both naked and malnourished
5629539 when the parents were asked how the children got in this condition they responded although we had the money to both feed and clothe our children we decided not to do so because all the companies that produce food and clothing are inefficiently run and have too many administrators
5629540 when questioned by reporters about the particulars of their allegations the parents said they had no direct information about the so called inefficiencies of the clothing and food companies but simply had heard rumors to that effect therefore they felt totally justified in starving and not clothing their children
5629541 i am looking forward to nevada joining the world in its quest to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
5629542 his history on this subject is not a cause for optimism
5629543 what concerns me is that the average citizen has to deal with whatever they put together and its a closed door system
5629544 i particularly hope he strengthens his economic message even sen obama can speak more clearly and specifically about the kitchen table bread and butter issues like high energy costs
5629545 no the problem isnt lack of specifics its lack of passion when it comes to the economy mr obamas campaign seems oddly lethargic
5629546 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5629547 the lack of any consistent lines of attack against mccain is becoming palpable
5629548 this explains why his tax plan gives money in tax breaks to people making 2 1 2 million dollars
5629549 i guess thats middle class everyone here making 2 1 2 million dollars raise your hands
5629550 this guy obviously doesnt pump his own gas do his own shopping or pay his own bills
5629551 so everywhere i go people tell me im getting nervous
5629552 im here to tell you now its not gonna work this time
5629553 coal prices are higher than what we expected for ely and there is looming the potential of carbon capture if its not the best alternative well have to do something else
5629554 there are a lot more uncertainties now about coal plants than when ely was approved by the public utilities commission two years ago
5629555 that landscape has changed so dramatically the utilities just never saw this
5629556 due to the fact that ely is so far removed from the population centers in nevada i dont think the environmental arguments have the kind of traction they would if it were going to be built 20 miles from the strip
5629557 the real impact changing the way folks look at ely now is that it would double rates this appears to be a black hole as far as money goes
5629558 im usually thought of as someone who just speaks for the environment but i think that all three of the arguments economic health and environmental are equal reasons why we should not build these coal plants

5629575 there should be one state that proves you can do it and it should be you and it could be you
5629576 if you could do it no one else would doubt that it can be done
5629577 maybe what you ought to come out of this conference with is a proposal to have the national government and investors all over america say help make us the first completely self sufficient clean energy state in the u s i promise if you did it it would rock the world
5629578 we have got to convince people this can be done and it would be good economics i am hopeful
5629579 now that were all singing from the same hymnal we just have to figure out how to turn our good intentions into concrete changes
5629580 no we havent because we havent had the support by president bush and his republican colleagues
5629581 and that is a shame because people are being laid off now with the renewable energy projects in the pipeline
5629582 we desperately need visionary leadership to fill in the gap
5629583 its already happening its having a tremendously negative effect on the industry
5629584 there are a lot of potential deals in place that could catapult the u s and nevada into a leadership role with renewable energy were on the cusp but were seeing a slowdown
5629585 if nevada is rated no 1 per capita in solar watts i think weve really done quite well
5629586 while we already have been recognized as a national leader in solar energy we believe there is much more to be accomplished in nevada
5629587 all of this potential is certainly feasible and our state particularly with the solar resources in southern nevada without doubt has the potential to be the solar mecca envisioned by president clinton
5629588 the thing about lifestyle oriented events is you cant cookie cutter them

5629595 clubs are great and maybe theyll have a dj you love but weve got 10 of them as well as strippers and people in funky outfits and some of the worlds best burlesque acts
5629596 i dont know what it is some people feel the need to look like somebody else

5629598 when i started i thought well this will last for a couple of years and then itll kind of fizzle out and thatll be the end of that and that was in 1983
5629599 i really cant only because the general public wont recognize the songs
5629600 unfortunately because of neils age or whatever it is his new stuff mostly ballads doesnt get any radio airplay
5629601 but he has such a huge variety of songs that came out in the 60s 70s and 80s that we cant even fit them all into the show at the riviera we have to rotate them to get them all in
5629602 although i guess i do act every night but i only know one part so ive learned to play one part really well i guess
5629603 i understand there was room for improvement and there still might be i work for screaming death monkey and frank spotnitz told us this week that the team have already spoken about the next x files film its likely the next release will go direct to dvd but theyre working on the assumption theyll have a similar budget
5629604 a year ago she voted no today shes for it

5629606 we need to do whatever we can to provide civilian aid and to show strength if they need help then we need to be there to help them but then get home as soon as possible

5629609 aparte de intentar influenciar a los cientos de millones de colonizadores en el tr pico los conservacionistas pueden ahora focalizar su atenci n en un n mero realmente peque o de corporaciones explotadoras de recursos muchas de ellas son multinacionales o empresas nacionales que buscan acceso a mercados internacionales lo cual las obliga a mostrar de cara a los consumidores mundiales y a sus accionistas un mayor respecto por el medio ambiente si se equivocan se exponen a sufrir ataques en su imagen p blica

5629643 you cant they simply have to trust that you do
5629644 well when i thnk of them i feel a certain way so i know it is related to how they feel and i then adjust the thoughts accordingly to determine what and why they are feeling this way
5629645 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
5629646 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
5629647 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
5629648 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
5629649 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
5629650 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5629651 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5629652 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5629653 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5629654 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5629655 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5629656 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5629657 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5629658 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5629659 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
5629660 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5629661 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
5629662 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
5629663 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
5629664 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
5629665 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as
5629666 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto
5629667 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
5629668 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
5629669 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
5629670 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
5629671 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
5629672 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
5629673 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
5629674 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
5629675 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
5629676 would you tell me please which way i ought to go from here
5629677 that depends a good deal on where you want to get to
5629678 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
5629679 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto

5629683 she looks like she sits on the sofa and eats all day
5629684 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
5629685 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5629686 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
5629687 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
5629688 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
5629689 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
5629690 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
5629691 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
5629692 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
5629693 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5629694 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5629695 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5629696 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5629697 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5629698 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5629699 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5629700 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5629701 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5629702 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
5629703 invocando la protecci n de dios fuente de toda raz n y justicia
5629704 y as pa no morir de hambre buscaban los animales de los men ndez por eso los mataba men ndez
5629705 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer
5629706 despu s de veinti n a os de explotarla trajeron unos pocos indios ac pero onas no vinieron m s que tres mujeres la paula la raquel y la petronila fueron las nicas que vinieron ac hombres no vino ninguno
5629707 detritus de la sociedad seres sin escr pulos y sin entra as que en pos del dinero y de la fortuna ca an en punta arenas atra dos por la f cil impunidad
5629708 sangre del gaucho y del indio s lo sirve para abonar la tierra
5629709 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
5629710 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5629711 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5629712 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5629713 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5629714 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5629715 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5629716 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5629717 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5629718 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5629719 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5629720 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5629721 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5629722 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5629723 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5629724 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5629725 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5629726 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5629727 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a

5629815 three of the insurgents killed themselves by detonating their suicide vests isaf forces killed three other suicide bombers before they could detonate their vests there were no isaf casualties in the attack
5629816 its about time someone did a documentary on j d
5629817 the first priority is to provide practical and political support to georgia
5629818 ensure russia does not learn the wrong lessons from the events of the last two weeks force cannot be the basis for the demarcation of new lines around russia
5629819 we hope that tomorrows decisions by nato will be balanced and that responsible forces in the west will give up the total cynicism that has been so evident which is pushing us back to the cold war era
5629820 we need to open the door to get the military monitors in now
5629821 oaky so lemme get this straight youre playing a game with yellow haired dudes going around collecting a dragons ballz good god how many does he have
5629822 christianity had conquered paganism and paganism had corrupted christianity the legends which belonged to osiris and apollo had been applied to the life of jesus
5629823 every part of freemasonry emphatically proclaims its pagan origin and that the god of its worship and religious philosophy is the old sun god of the ancient mysteries the osiris of the egyptians or the boal of the idolatrous israelites
5629824 we readily recognize in hiram abiff the osiris of the egyptians the mithras of the persians the bacchus of the greeks
5629825 placed themselves at the south west and east gates of the inner court of the temple and there awaited his return
5629826 and that the place may he known should occasion thereafter ever require it
5629827 oh that mv throat had been cut across my tongue torn out by its roots and buried in the rough sands of the sea at low water mark where the tide ebbs and flows twice in twenty four hours ere i had consented to the death of so great a man as our grand master hiram abiff
5629828 oh that my body had been cut in two my bowels taken from thence and burned to ashes and the ashes scattered to the four winds of heaven so that no more trace or remembrance might be had of so vile and perjured a wretch as i ere i had caused the death of so great and so good a man as our grand master hiram abiff
5629829 ah jubela and jubelo it is i who am more guiit v than you both it was i who struck the fatal blow it was i who killed him
5629830 oh lord my god was there no help for the widows son oh lord my god i fear that the masters word is forever lost
5629831 my worthy companion of tyre you will now take the body by the fellow crafts grip and see if it can be so raised
5629832 it is vital that uk sport gets that money now or elite programmes will be cut in the run up to london 2012 and that is ridiculous
5629833 i am hoping he will confirm that there is no doubt that team gb will be fully funded to the tune of the 600 million that as chancellor of the exchequer he announced in the budget two and a half years ago
5629834 rowing are getting the medals this year again they could get more and better results
5629835 they look immaculate they dominate the arena and they know they can deliver i have never doubted that british people are winners when you have the raw talent in any single sport then anything is possible
5629836 you only need to see in the velodrome the presence of the gb squad and their whole approach that success is based on world class formula one preparation
5629837 and we have to see some of the nonformula one sports learning from them there is a willingness to exchange ideas and go forward as a unit to 2012
5629838 i have had a wonderful time and it has been good fun
5629839 well be able to treat it conservatively and hell have to get his strength back in it
5629840 it came out and went right back in on the field
5629841 we were a little bit out of sync in the passing game early
5629842 you may as well spend it all now because it will only buy less in future
5629843 as you cant access your money without penalty these are unpopular with most savers
5629844 the slowing in growth will prompt rate cuts by early next year once the peak in inflation has passed
5629845 continuing worries about a u s economy slowdown which may spread to the euro zone and perhaps also asia are weighing down on oil pricing
5629846 in the near term there will be a lot of downward pressure but i dont foresee a fast collapse of pricing to 100 dollars a barrel or below there is still strong support at 110 a barrel level because of supply side issues
5629847 cyber bullying is not under any definition trespass or theft
5629848 cyber bullying is a relatively new phenomenon as is social networking
5629849 it is therefore not surprising that there have been relatively few prosecutions in this area
5629850 as a tool to address all manner of cyber crimes
5629851 moreover the vehicle for the cyber bullying at issue here a social networking web site only became mainstream after 2000
5629852 invites a host of difficult thorny problems and unwanted results
5629853 i think the youth from 12 to 18 are kind of lost they dont know their place in the tribe

5629855 we need more parental supervision we need more guidance we need more activities out there that will keep kids involved
5629856 we need a recreation area around here where kids can play basketball
5629857 kids drop out of school and dont finish their education
5629858 i think my daughter tried a little too hard to try to fit in she was an impressionable age
5629859 that seems to be like a normal thing on the reservation like drugs and alcohol and she was exposed to it more and i dont know that she knew how to handle it
5629860 we have a long waiting list of people waiting to go to treatment
5629861 i am happy to hear that i have broke it but i can definitely go faster than that
5629862 no matter which piece of music youre playing see it as the best piece of music ever written

5629869 over the next two years i will be working with a contemporary arts group the gulbenkian foundation and the portland sculpture and quarry trust to develop this large and unique instrument as part of my role as an ambassador for the cultural olympiad
5629870 i am very keen to promote this exciting project and its implications both locally and on the worldwide stage as we approach the london 2012 olympic and paralympic games
5629871 portland stone is made from little round egg shaped calcium carbonate deposits and when you strike these stone they create many different tones bells and harmonics
5629872 ringing the stones by striking them with a tool is a technique used historically by quarrymen and stonemasons to identify a stones geology and structure and to test for faults in order to make selections
5629873 we are delighted to support a visit from such an extraordinarily talented and inspirational musician
5629874 this is yet another indication of the exciting times weymouth and portland are currently embarking upon
5629875 here she sat in my home the day after i became engaged repeatedly telling me how everyone in my very recent fiances family disapproved of our engagement and disliked distrusted me and was worried about my fiance and his happiness katie mae

5629940 de raad van bestuur heeft mij unaniem gevraagd om te blijven als de leden een vertrek hadden gewild was ik gegaan ik beschouw mij als een dienaar van fortis

5629942 we hebben de bank wel op het hoogtepunt gekocht de weken erna stapelden de negatieve berichten over de wereldeconomie zich op maar dat is wijsheid achteraf

5629944 je hoeft geen bolleboos te zijn om te beseffen dat die deadline onze onderhandelingspositie slechter maakte we hebben kroes gesmeekt om een verlenging maar het antwoord bleef onverbiddelijk nee
5629945 we wilden snel op vragen inspelen een vergadering kost meer voorbereidingstijd en is niet geschikt voor een dialoog deze sessie is een premi re er zullen er meer volgen
5629946 bedankt voor het idee maar we doen het anders we gaan door de integratie van abn amro 1 3 miljard euro aan synergievoordelen binnenhalen die doelstelling staat nog steeds

5629970 we were just so close to a winning season to a bowl
5629971 and the memories of that of not wanting to make those same mistakes again really motives us this year
5629972 we had a few problems last year where we played the first half then were kind of lying around second half
5629973 we couldnt put it all together but weve got that under our belt now we know what we need to do
5629974 but once you get past that it provides you with an unbelievable array of learning experiences
5629975 everything that we talked about in the spring time we can relay it back to a missed opportunity last year
